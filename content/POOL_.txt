 item 1 business 

general 

pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us or our  a member of the sp 500 index is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2021 we operated 410 sales centers in north america europe and australia through our five distribution networks 

• scp distributors scp 

• superior pool products superior 

• horizon distributors horizon 

• national pool tile npt and 

• sun wholesale supply inc sun wholesale 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry has room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools technological advancements and the development of environmentally sustainable energyefficient and more aesthetically attractive products additionally the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

• longterm growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern united states where use of the outdoor home environment is more prevalent and extends longer throughout the year 

• increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment 

• consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products with new irrigation systems landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels 

• consumers using more automation and control products higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time 

• consumers increasing focus on environmentally sustainable energyefficient products and 

• increased consumer spending driven by stayathome and remote work trends as homeowners seek to create attractive areas in their backyards as an extension of their home space 

almost 60 of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining a proper sanitization balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenancerelated goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted consumer discretionary spending including pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2020 pk data inc reports 

the replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for 20 to 25 of consumer spending in the pool industry the activity in this market which includes major swimming pool remodeling is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors including home values singlefamily home sales and consumer confidence that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises 15 to 20 of consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize similar longterm growth rates irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new singlefamily home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables that drive new home sales however the landscape industry offers similar maintenancerelated growth opportunities as the swimming pool industry product offerings such as chemicals and fertilizers power equipment and related repair and maintenance services offer recurring revenue streams in an industry otherwise closely tied to the housing market the irrigation and landscape distribution business serves both residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market within the united states market we believe that irrigation accounts for approximately 35 of total spending in the industry with the remaining 65 of spending related to landscape maintenance products power equipment hardscapes and specialty outdoor products and accessories 

our npt network primarily serves the swimming pool market but does provide some overlap with the irrigation and landscape industries as we offer our marketleading brand of pool tile composite pool finish products and hardscapes as more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand while leveraging our existing pool and irrigation and landscape customer base we feel the development of our npt network is a natural extension of our distribution model in addition to our 20 standalone npt sales centers we currently have over 100 scp and superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where landscape and swimming pool contractors as well as homeowners can view and select pool components including pool tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades and serve as stocking locations for our npt branded products we also offer virtual tools for homeowners to select and design their pool and outdoor environments working with their chosen contractors to install these products our npt backyard app allows our customers to virtually design customize and view a pool in their own backyard within seconds we believe our showrooms local stocking of products and virtual support provide us with a competitive advantage in these categories given the more discretionary nature of these products this business is more sensitive to external market factors compared to our business overall 

economic environment 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments equipment replacement landscaping projects and outdoor living space renovations consumers typically spend more on new pools refurbishment and replacement when general economic conditions are strong 

we believe that over the long term singlefamily housing turnover and home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ good economic standing and access to consumer credit are critical factors enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and employment levels contractor labor availability has also become an issue in recent years limiting our customers’ ability to fully meet consumer construction and renovation demand labor supply constraints have intensified during the covid19 pandemic which has limited our customers’ ability to meet increased demand for new pool construction and renovation 

over the past decade homeowners investing in their homes including backyard renovations have flourished steady increases in home values and lack of affordable new homes have prompted homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments including their backyards in response to the covid19 pandemic over the past couple of years many families spent more time at home and sought out opportunities to create or expand homebased outdoor living and entertainment spaces which resulted in an increase in new pool construction and greater expenditures for maintenance and remodeling products we estimate that new pool construction increased to approximately 120000 units in 2021 from 96000 units in 2020 representing a 25 increase in new pool construction we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally subject to labor availability but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces will generate greater growth over the next several years as backyards more increasingly become an extension of consumers’ home space 

although some constraints exist around residential construction activities we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry additionally regulation passed by the us department of energy which became effective in july 2021 mandates all new motors and pumps for swimming pools must meet certain compliance regulations we believe that this mandate coupled with additional product developments and technological advancements as consumers focus on more environmentally sustainable and energyefficient products offers further growth opportunities over the next few years 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past ten years we generally pass industry price increases through our supply chain and may make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in order to obtain favorable pricing recently supply chain interruptions production shutdowns and weatherrelated events have resulted in increased inflation as higher costs to develop finished products are being passed down to consumers our results in 2021 benefited from aboveaverage inflationary product cost increases of approximately 7 to 8 we expect this trend to continue into 2022 we expect sales growth in 2022 to be higher due to impacts from inflationary product cost increases of approximately 9 to 10 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers creating exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our core strategies are as follows 

• to promote the growth of our industry 

• to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and 

• to continuously strive to operate more effectively 

we promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include digital and media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® wwwhottubscom ® and wwwnptpoolcom ® social media platforms and other digital marketing initiatives including our npt® backyard mobile app we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design product merchandising business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes in addition to these programs we feature consumer showrooms in over 100 of our sales centers and host our annual retail summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry although we did not host our annual retail summit over the past two years due to the covid19 pandemic we also act as a daytoday resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations which we define as capacity creation we aim to create capacity with business to business development tools and execution to ensure bestinclass service and value creation for our customers and suppliers in particular we have developed the pool360 and horizon 247 platforms that help our customers be more productive by allowing them to get pricing check availability enter orders and make payments online while leveraging our customer service staff resources particularly during peak business periods these tools not only offer realtime integration into our enterprise resource planning system creating efficiencies in our business processes as well but they also provide our customers graphical catalog presentation in the same platform our bluestreak mobile ordering platform enables our sales associates to process orders faster often eliminating the need for customers to get out of their vehicles we are also actively making improvements to our sales centers and warehouses including improved showroom layouts sales center merchandising bin replenishment and velocity slotting velocity slotting uses technology to identify fast moving high velocity items which are then colorcoded and placed in an easily accessible location to create efficiencies for both our employees and customers in addition to these initiatives we strive to expand our pool corporationbranded products and exclusive brand offerings 

we have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers depending on our market presence and capacity in 2021 we have grown our distribution network through the acquisition of the sun wholesale distribution network sun wholesale distributes swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically primarily servicing pinch a penny inc franchisees pinch a penny inc is a franchisor of pool and outdoor livingrelated specialty retail stores in the united states with approximately 260 independently owned and operated franchised stores in florida texas louisiana alabama and georgia sun wholesale also owns and operates a specialty chemical packaging operation for additional information regarding our new sales center openings acquisitions and closuresconsolidations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in this form 10k 

we plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically going forward we expect to realize sales growth through market share gains and continued expansion of our product offerings 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 120000 customers no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales in 2021 most of our customers are small familyowned businesses with relatively limited capital resources most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors and specialty retailers employing no more than ten employees in many cases working alone or with a limited crew these customers also buy from other distributors mass merchants home stores and certain specialty and internet retailers 

we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers for sales under early buy programs the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments during the second quarter of each year see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  allowance for doubtful accounts” for additional information 

we sell our products primarily to the following types of customers 

• swimming pool remodelers and builders 

• specialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies 

• swimming pool repair and service businesses 

• irrigation construction and landscape maintenance contractors and 

• commercial customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities 

we conduct our operations through 410 sales centers in north america europe and australia our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california texas florida and arizona collectively representing approximately 53 of our 2021 net sales in 2021 we generated approximately 94 of our sales in north america including canada and mexico 5 in europe and 1 in australia while we continue to expand both domestically and internationally we expect this geographic mix to be similar over the next few years references to product line and product category data throughout this form 10k generally reflect data related to the north american swimming pool market as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations 

we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 200000 manufacturer and pool corporationbranded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and related products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry we sell the following types of products 

  

• maintenance products such as chemicals supplies and pool accessories 

• repair and replacement parts for pool equipment such as cleaners filters heaters pumps and lights 

• fiberglass pools and hot tubs and packaged pool kits including walls liners braces and coping for inground and aboveground pools 

• pool equipment and components for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools 

• irrigation and related products including irrigation system components and professional lawn care equipment and supplies 

• building materials such as concrete plumbing and electrical components both functional and decorative pool surfaces decking materials tile hardscapes and natural stone used for pool installations and remodeling 

• commercial products including american society of material engineers heaters safety equipment and commercial pumps and filters and 

• other pool construction and recreational products which consist of a number of product categories and include discretionary recreational and related outdoor living products such as grills and components for outdoor kitchens 

we currently have over 600 product lines and approximately 50 product categories based on our 2021 product classifications sales for our pool and hot tub chemicals product category represented approximately 9 of total net sales for 2021 10 of total net sales in 2020 and 12 of total net sales in 2019 no other product categories accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets we then evaluate the performance in these markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

new product technology provides opportunities not only for improved energyefficiency but also new enticements for leisure activities smart controls provide growth opportunities as most existing swimming pools run on mechanical time clocks major equipment manufacturers have developed and will continue to develop more retrofit kits that allow homeowners to interact with their pools or hot tubs through their smartphones robotic cleaners offer consumers a more efficient option for maintaining their swimming pools we see each of these developments as significant growth opportunities we offer a growing selection of energyefficient and environmentally preferred products which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy water and money our green technology products include variable speed pumps led pool and hot tub lights and highefficiency heat pumps our horizon sales centers offer organic fertilizers organic pesticides and irrigation products that reduce water usage allowing our customers to have less of an impact on freshwater reserves regulation passed by the us department of energy which became effective in july 2021 mandates all new motors and pumps sold for swimming pools must meet certain compliance regulations as the regulation has only recently become effective the impact from this change through the end of 2021 season was not significant 

over the last several years we have increased our product offerings and service abilities related to commercial swimming pools we consider the commercial market to be a key growth opportunity as we focus more attention on providing products to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels condominiums apartment complexes universities and community recreational facilities we continue to leverage our existing networks and relationships to grow this market sales to commercial customers declined in 2020 due to covid19 related closures and the decline in both business and leisure travel in 2021 commercial sales have accelerated as business and leisure travel has increased and public facilities reopened following covid19 related closures in the prior year 

in 2021 the sale of maintenance and minor repair products nondiscretionary accounted for almost 60 of our sales and gross profits while just over 40 of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools partially discretionary during the economic downturn which spanned from late 2006 to early 2010 and reached its low point in 2009 sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction and deferred remodeling and replacement activity the current trend reflects a partial shift back toward a greater percentage of our sales coming from major refurbishment and replacement products due to the recovery of these activities since levels reached their historic low point in 2009 

since 2009 we have experienced product and customer mix changes including a shift in consumer spending to some higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps and high efficiency heaters we expect continued demand for these products but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives including growth in our higher margin private label and exclusive products plex and our expansion of building materials product offerings have helped offset these gross margin declines 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool market primarily to offer our customers a choice of distinctive product selections locations and service personnel we distribute irrigation and related products through our horizon network and tile decking materials and interior pool finish products through our npt network as well as through scp and superior networks in december 2021 we acquired sun wholesale which distributes swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically primarily servicing independently owned and operated pinch a penny inc franchise locations going forward we expect to expand our franchise operations through additional locations of pinch a penny franchised stores sun wholesale supply inc also owns and operates a specialty chemical packaging operation 

we evaluate our sales centers based on their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs human resources support information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or thirdparty carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions for additional information regarding our inventory management see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  inventory obsolescence” of this form 10k 

we also operate four centralized shipping locations csls in the united states that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and landscape products and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool corporation which are referred to as early buy purchases these early buy purchases typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer due to vendor backlogs these early buy opportunities were generally not available in 2021 or 2020 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors offering the best overall terms and service to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  vendor programs” for additional information 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to ensure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair plc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20 10 and 10 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2021 

competition 

we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products based on industry knowledge and available data and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies we also face competition both directly and indirectly from mass market retailers both storebased and internet and large pool supply retailers who primarily buy directly from manufacturers 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of california texas florida and arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply distribution are 

• the breadth and availability of products offered 

• the quality and level of customer service including ease of ordering and product delivery 

• the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs 

• consistency and stability of business relationships with customers and suppliers 

• competitive product pricing and 

• geographic proximity to the customer

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of swimming pool use pool and irrigation installation and remodeling and repair activities sales are lower during the first and fourth quarters in 2021 we generated approximately 60 of our net sales and 69 of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the late spring and summer primarily because extended terms offered by our suppliers are typically payable during the second quarter of each year while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statement are described below investors should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks discussed below are not the only risks we face other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business if they occur moreover new risks emerge from time to time further our business may also be affected by additional factors that generally apply to all companies operating in the us and globally which have not been included 

risks relating to macroeconomic conditions 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation landscape and related outdoor living products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer discretionary spending or unfavorable economic conditions 

consumer discretionary spending significantly affects our sales and is impacted by factors outside of our control including general economic conditions the residential housing market unemployment rates wage levels interest rate fluctuations inflation disposable income levels consumer confidence and access to credit in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation landscape and related outdoor living products may decline often corresponding with declines in discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction maintenance and repair products and certain replacement and refurbishment products are required to maintain existing swimming pools and each currently accounts for approximately 60 and 20 to 25 of net sales related to our swimming pool business however the growth in this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbishment activity even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit at attractive interest rates is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pools irrigation systems and outdoor living products between late 2006 and early 2010 the unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems any similar tightening of consumer credit or any increase in interest rates in the future could prevent consumers from obtaining financing for pool irrigation and related outdoor projects which could negatively impact our sales of constructionrelated products 

discretionary spending is often adversely affected during times of economic social or political uncertainty the potential for natural or manmade disasters or extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business in ways that we cannot presently predict 

the covid19 pandemic other pandemics or epidemics in the future and associated responses could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets throughout the world since early 2020 in response various governmental authorities have imposed stayathome orders shelterinplace orders quarantines executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions to control the spread of covid19 such orders or restrictions have resulted in temporary store closures limitation of store hours limitations on the number of people in stores or in warehouses enhanced requirements on sanitation social distancing practices and travel restrictions among other effects in almost all of our markets we are designated as an essential business under the relevant state and local regulations however if this changes it could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results variants of the virus that cause covid19 continue to be identified in the us and elsewhere which has led to uncertainty over the scope and duration of the pandemic accordingly covid19 or any other future pandemic or other major public health crisis may have negative impacts on our business in the future and any future adverse impacts on our business may be worse than we anticipate 

impacts from the covid19 pandemic coupled with heightened demand could also adversely impact our supply chain making it difficult to source and receive products needed to keep our customers adequately supplied the ultimate impact will depend on the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic any future resurgences and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response including the distribution and acceptance of vaccines each of which is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict our recent growth rates driven by homecentric trends influenced by the covid19 pandemic may not be sustainable and may not be indicative of future growth rates 

risks relating to our business and industry 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions which could intensify as a result of climate change 

given the nature of our business weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business and the effect of seasonality has a significant impact on our results in 2021 we generated approximately 60 of our net sales and 69 of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of swimming pool use pool and irrigation installation and remodeling and repair activities unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can have an adverse impact on demand due to decreased swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as decreased irrigation installations while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to governmentimposed water use restrictions such restrictions could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations which could negatively impact our sales 

certain extreme weather events such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes tropical storms floods drought and wildfires may adversely impact us in several ways including interfering with our ability to deliver our products and services interfering with our receipt of supplies from our vendors reducing demand for our products and services and damaging our facilities climate change may increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather events in the future which would increase our exposure to these risks concern over climate change may also result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change which could increase our operating or capital expenses 

for additional discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however any failure to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair plc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20 10 and 10 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2021 a decision by our largest suppliers acting individually or in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally if our suppliers experience difficulties or disruptions in their operations if there is any material interruption in our supply chain or if we lose a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers we may experience increased supply costs or delays in establishing replacement supply sources that meet our quality and control standards which may affect our profitability thus far the covid19 pandemic has not materially impacted our supply chain and we do not expect it to materially impact our supply chain in 2022 although we can provide no assurances to this effect 

we depend on a global network of suppliers to source our products including our own branded products and products we have exclusive distribution rights to failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety could damage our reputation expose us to litigation and negatively impact our financial performance 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we distribute to succeed we must continue to maintain effective business relationships with qualified suppliers who can timely and efficiently supply us with high quality products as we increase the number of pool corporation and affiliate branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our business if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks as well as governmental enforcement actions actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including healthrelated concerns could damage our reputation with current or prospective customers vendors and employees product quality or safety issues could also expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities similar concerns impacting our competitors could damage the reputation of our industry and indirectly have an unfavorable impact on our operations 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

within our industry we directly compete against various regional and local distributors for the business of pool owners and other enduse customers we indirectly compete against mass market retailers and large pool or irrigation supply retailers as they purchase the great majority of their needs directly from manufacturers we compete to a lesser extent with internet retailers as they purchase the majority of their needs from distributors outside of our industry we compete indirectly with alternative suppliers of bigticket consumer discretionary products such as boat and motor home distributors and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers 

new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry which has led to highly competitive markets consisting of varioussized entities ranging from small or local operators to large regional businesses if our customers are attracted by the alternatives afforded by any of our competitors they may be less inclined to purchase products or services from us impacting our results of operations given the density and demand for pool products some geographic markets that we serve also tend to have a higher concentration of competitors than others particularly california texas florida and arizona these states encompass our four largest markets and represented approximately 53 of our net sales in 2021 the entry of significant new competitors into these markets could negatively impact our sales 

more aggressive competition by store and internetbased mass merchants and large pool or irrigation supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and irrigation related products has remained relatively constant should store‑ and internetbased mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or irrigation industries or increase the breadth of their pool and irrigation and related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business additionally because the internet facilitates competitive entry price transparency and comparison shopping increased internet sales by us or our competitors could increase the level of competition we face or reduce our margin further we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or irrigation supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel this includes succession planning related to our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

given the seasonal nature of our business we may hire additional employees during the summer months including seasonal and parttime employees who generally are not employed during the offseason if we are unable to attract and hire additional personnel during the peak season our operating results could be negatively impacted additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees 

the pandemic and other events over the past couple of years have increased employees’ expectations regarding compensation workplace flexibility and workhome balance these developments have made it more difficult for us to attract and retain top talent we do not expect these developments to have a material adverse impact on us but we can provide no assurances to this effect 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through organic market share gains new sales center openings and acquisitions that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution our various business strategies and initiatives including our growth initiatives are subject to business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control while we contemplate continued growth through internal expansion and acquisitions no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

• penetrate new markets 

• generate sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and general operating activities 

• obtain financing 

• identify appropriate acquisition candidates and successfully integrate acquired businesses 

• identify appropriate locations for new sales centers and successfully integrate them into our network 

• maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships and 

• identify and divest assets which do not continue to create value consistent with our objectives 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our results in 2020 and 2021 were positively impacted by homecentric trends resulting from the covid19 pandemic these trends may not continue or may reverse which could adversely impact our results of operations in addition in recent years our customers have had difficulty employing a sufficient number of qualified individuals to keep up with the demand for pool installation maintenance and refurbishment if this trend continues or accelerates our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to inventory management risks insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may negatively impact our gross margin 

we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing customer or consumer requirements and fluctuating commodity prices in order to successfully manage our inventories we must estimate demand from our customers and purchase products that substantially correspond to consumer demand if we overestimate demand and purchase too much of a particular product we face a risk that the price of that product will fall leaving us with inventory that we cannot sell at normal profit margins in addition we may have to write down such inventory if we are unable to sell it for its recorded value if we underestimate demand and purchase insufficient quantities of products inventory shortages could result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available if we maintain insufficient inventory levels and prices rise for these products we could be forced to purchase products at higher prices and forego profitability in order to meet customer demand while always present these challenges have been heightened over the past couple years as the pandemic has altered consumer spending trends our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if either or both of these situations occur frequently or in large volumes 

risks relating to technology cybersecurity and data privacy 

we rely on information technology systems to support our business operations a significant disturbance breach or cybersecurity attack of our technological infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

information technology supports several aspects of our business including among others product sourcing pricing customer service transaction processing inventory management financial reporting collections and cost management our ability to operate effectively on a daytoday basis communicate with our customers and accurately report our results depends on a reliable technological infrastructure which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats we are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunication failures internet failures security breaches and other catastrophic events exposure to various types of cyberattacks such as malware computer viruses worms ransomware or other malicious acts as well as human error could also potentially disrupt our operations result in a significant interruption in the delivery of our goods and services or result in the loss of sensitive data 

we are making and expect to continue to make investments in technology to maintain and update our computer systems and to expand our ability to engage in ecommerce with our customers we may not implement these changes as quickly or successfully as our customers expect in addition implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives or conversions including those contemplated under our currently pending multiyear systems upgrade project further described elsewhere herein as well as providing training and support for those initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency advances in computer and software capabilities encryption technology and other discoveries increase the complexity of our technological environment including how each interact with our various software platforms such advances could delay or hinder our ability to process transactions or could compromise the integrity of our data resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations we also may experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our information systems unavailable or slow to respond including the interaction of our information systems with those of third parties or the failure of software of services provided by third parties that we do not control a lack of sophistication or reliability of our information systems could adversely impact our operations and customer service and could require major repairs or replacements resulting in significant costs and foregone revenue 

like other companies our size we devote significant resources to protect our systems and data from cyberattacks despite our substantial efforts to defend against these attacks we have faced various attempted cyberattacks that did not result in a material adverse effect on our operations operating results or financial condition the risk of breaches is likely to continue to increase due to several factors including the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks and the wider accessibility of cyberattack tools known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities are constantly evolving which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them consequently we may not be able to implement security barriers or other preventative measures that repel all future cyberattacks or detect such attacks in a timely manner to minimize the potential business disruption and unfavorable financial impacts 

although we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions including selfinsured deductibles coverage restrictions and monetary coverage caps cover certain aspects of our cyber risks such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses 

failure to maintain the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation additionally changes in data privacy laws and our ability to comply with them could have a material adverse effect on us 

we collect and store data that is sensitive to us and our employees customers and vendors the failure to maintain security over and prevent unauthorized access to our data our customers’ personal information including credit card information or data belonging to our suppliers could put us at a competitive disadvantage such a breach could result in damage to our reputation and subject us to potential litigation liability fines and penalties and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these issues resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a variety of state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal and other data the european union and other international regulators as well as state governments have recently enacted or enhanced data privacy regulations such as the california consumer privacy act and other governments are considering establishing similar or stronger protections these regulations impose certain obligations for handling specified personal information in our systems and for apprising individuals of the information we have collected about them many of these laws are complex and change frequently and often conflict with the laws in other jurisdictions despite our best efforts to comply any noncompliance could result in incurring potential substantial penalties and reputational damage 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with employment environmental health transportation safety and other governmental regulations our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state local and international employment environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees or other wage labor or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business and adversely impact our results of operations 

we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing management has processes in place to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements however failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in investigations the assessment of administrative civil and criminal fines damages seizures disgorgements penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to regulatory matters in amounts that may be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 

the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulations is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemicals and the discharge of greenhouse gases increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase our attempts to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and our plans to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance may not be as effective as we anticipate 

our business could be impacted by our public statements regarding various corporate environmental social and governance “esg” initiatives or changes in consumers’ view of our products as part of our strategy regarding esg matters we may set targets aimed at reducing our impact on the environment and climate change or targets relating to other sustainability matters it is possible that we may not be able to achieve such targets or our desired impact which may cause us to suffer from reputational damage or our business or financial condition could be adversely affected actions we take to achieve our strategy or targets could result in increased costs to our operations and changes in customers’ attitudes towards the environmental impact of our pool chemical products could reduce our sales in addition investors and stakeholders are increasingly focused on esg matters and positions we take or refrain from taking on esg issues could negatively impact our reputation or relations with investors customers vendors employees and others 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustibles and oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our ability to successfully conduct operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations including canada and mexico which accounted for 10 of our total net sales in 2021 expose us to certain additional risks including 

• difficulty in staffing international subsidiary operations 

• different political economic and regulatory conditions 

• local laws and customs 

• currency fluctuations exchange controls and repatriation restrictions 

• adverse tax consequences and 

• adverse consequences for violating anticorruption anticompetition economic sanctions immigration and other laws governing international commerce 

for foreignsourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

excess tax benefits or deficiencies recognized from our accounting for sharebased awards impact our reported earnings 

in 2017 we adopted accounting standards update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  our projections of financial statement impacts related to asu 201609 are subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options excess tax benefits or deficiencies recognized under asu 201609 vary from quarter to quarter and past results may not be indicative of future results 

general risks 

changes in tax laws and accounting standards related to tax matters have caused and may in the future cause fluctuations in our effective tax rate 

taxation and tax policy changes tax rate changes new tax laws revised tax law interpretations and changes in accounting standards and guidance related to tax matters may cause fluctuations in or adversely affect our effective tax rate our effective tax rate may also be impacted by changes in the geographic mix of our earnings 

we cannot assure you we will continue paying dividends at the current rates or at all 

we cannot assure you we will continue periodic dividends on our capital stock at the current rates or at all any quarterly dividends on our common stock will be paid from funds legally available for such purpose when and if declared by our board of directors decisions on whether when and in which amounts to continue making any future dividend distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our board of directors which reserves the right to change or terminate our dividend practices at any time and for any reason without prior notice holders of our common stock should be aware they have no contractual or other legal right to receive dividends 

similarly holders of our common stock should be aware that repurchases of our common stock under any repurchase plan then in effect are completely discretionary and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason regardless of our financial position 

lapses in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect us 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the accuracy and completeness of our sec reports and internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability and compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” of our financial statements we cannot assure you these measures will be effective 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined 

borrowings under our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility term facility accounts receivable securitization facility and our derivatives instruments are indexed to the london interbank offering rate “libor” in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the regulatory authority over libor stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration “iba” the administrator of libor with the support of the united states federal reserve and the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of usd libor on december 31 2021 for only the one week and two month usd libor tenors and on june 30 2023 for all other usd libor tenors while this announcement extends the transition period to june 2023 the united states federal reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new usd libor issuances by the end of 2021 although the alternative reference rates committee has endorsed the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its preferred replacement for libor the market transition away from libor towards sofr may be complicated and there is no guarantee that sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor the full impact of the transition away from libor including the discontinuance of libor publication and the transition to a replacement rate may have an adverse impact on our financing costs and any floating rate indebtedness we may incur

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for a discussion of our base business calculations see the results of operations section below 

2021 financial overview 

financial results 

net sales increased 35 to 53 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 39 billion in 2020 while base business sales increased 29 our sales were driven by strong customer demand for outdoor living products throughout the year and benefited from inflation and warmer weather trends across most of the united states 

gross profit reached 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 a 43 increase over gross profit of 11 billion in 2020 gross margin improved 180 basis points to 305 in 2021 compared to 287 in 2020 reflecting benefits from our actions to address inflation and manage supply chain disruptions along with favorable impacts realized from increased purchase volumes

covid19 pandemic 

we continue to monitor the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic including the effects of recent notable variants of the virus the health safety and security of our employees and the communities in which we operate remains our highest priority we have adapted our operations and implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer sales center environment for both our customers and employees which includes following best practices and guidelines from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc we implemented enhanced hygiene and sanitation practices at our sales centers and at our corporate offices in 2020 and we continue to evaluate and maintain them 

we are designated as an essential business in almost all of our markets our products are used to maintain and protect outdoor commercial residential and municipal environments through chemicallybalanced virus and bacteriafree swimming pool water we also supply products used in the prevention of runoff flood fire and other natural disasters these products are essential to the health and safety of the general public in limited instances we have had to close facilities as a result of government regulations as well as covid19 cases the direct impact of any closures to date have not had a material impact on our operations or results 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and through the end of 2021 we experienced unprecedented demand as families spent more time at home and sought out opportunities to create or expand homebased outdoor living and entertainment spaces while this trend has had a positive impact on our financial performance over the past couple of years it is unclear what the longterm impact will be 

our industry experienced constrained supply chain dynamics in 2021 in response we have been proactive in making significant investments in inventory to enable us to continue to meet strong customer demand and position ourselves to provide exceptional customer service into the 2022 season these trends caused in large part from global disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic may persist in the nearterm 

we expect the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results in 2022 will continue to vary by location and depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict these factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic global economic conditions during and after the pandemic the reinstitution of governmental actions that could restrict the activities of our customers vendors or employees the possibility of additional subsequent outbreaks the sustainability of current homecentric trends and other changes in customer and supplier behavior in response to the pandemic 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations was 3135 million in 2021 cash provided by operations throughout the year helped fund the following initiatives 

• net working capital outflows of 3923 million 

• share repurchases totaling 1380 million for the year 

• quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders totaling 1196 million for the year and 

• net capital expenditures of 377 million 

total net receivables including pledged receivables increased 30 compared to december 31 2020 primarily driven by our sales growth and 2021 acquisitions our allowance for doubtful accounts was 59 million at december 31 2021 and 48 million at december 31 2020 our days sales outstanding ratio as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis was 256 days at december 31 2021 and 265 days at december 31 2020 

inventory levels grew 71 to 13 billion at december 31 2021 compared to 7810 million at december 31 2020 reflecting significant investments in inventory throughout the year to support increased demand and help manage supply chain pressures in addition to impacts from inflation and acquisitions our reserve for inventory obsolescence was 152 million at december 31 2021 compared to 114 million at december 31 2020 our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis were 34 times at december 31 2021 and 38 times at december 31 2020 our inventory turns at december 31 2021 are consistent with average inventory turns over the past five years 

accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased 1212 million to 2649 million in 2021 primarily reflecting an increase in deferred income tax payments of 795 million and a 164 million increase in accrued performancebased compensation as allowed for companies impacted by hurricane ida we deferred our 2021 third and fourth quarter estimated federal tax payments which were paid in february 2022 

total debt outstanding of 12 billion at december 31 2021 increased 7673 million compared to december 31 2020 we utilized debt proceeds to fund our 2021 acquisitions including porpoise pool  patio inc which we purchased on december 16 2021 for 7887 million net of cash acquired 

current trends and outlook 

over the past two years in response to the covid19 pandemic families spent more time at home and sought out opportunities to create or expand homebased outdoor living and entertainment spaces which resulted in an increase in new pool construction and greater expenditures for maintenance and remodeling products we believe that increased consumer spending on homes including outdoor living spaces will have longer term benefits as workfromhome trends persist or increase 

over the past decade homeowners investing in their homes including backyard renovations have flourished steady increases in home values and lack of affordable new homes have prompted homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments including their backyards we expect that new pool and irrigation system construction levels will continue to grow incrementally constrained by availability of construction labor however we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces will generate continued growth over the next several years although some constraints exist around residential construction activities we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the near term market expansion and the inherent long term growth opportunities in our industry 

we have benefited from strong pool construction trends as robust demand fueled by the covid19 pandemic led to increased home investment trends we estimate that new pool construction increased to approximately 120000 units in 2021 from 96000 units in 2020 representing a 25 increase in new pool construction favorable weather positively impacts industry growth by accelerating growth in any given year expanding the number of available construction days extending the pool season and pool usage and positively impacting demand for discretionary products conversely unfavorable weather impedes growth in establishing our outlook each year we base our growth assumptions on normal weather conditions and do not incorporate alternative weather predictions into our guidance 

we established our initial outlook for 2022 based on reasonable expectations of organic industry and market share growth ongoing leverage of existing investments in our business and continuous process improvements impacts from the covid19 pandemic coupled with heightened demand could continue to adversely impact our supply chain making it difficult to source and receive products needed to keep our customers adequately supplied although supply constraints did not have a material impact on our business in 2021 it is difficult to predict the extent to which this could impact our business in 2022 

we expect to continue to gain market share through our comprehensive service and product offerings which we continually diversify through internal sourcing initiatives and expansion into new markets we also plan to broaden our geographic presence by opening 8 to 10 new sales centers in 2022 and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise 

the following summarizes our outlook for 2022 

• we expect sales growth of 17 to 19 impacted by the following factors and assumptions 

◦ normal weather patterns for 2022 

◦ continued elevated demand for residential pool products driven by homecentric trends 

◦ a benefit from construction backlogs depending on our customers’ building capacity including the availability of labor and weather 

◦ inflationary product cost increases which generally pass through to customers of approximately 9 to 10 compared to 7 to 8 in 2021 

◦ estimated 5 growth from acquisitions completed throughout 2021 and 

◦ market share gains 

• we expect relatively neutral gross margin trends for the full year of 2022 compared to the full year of 2021 with modest improvements in the first half of 2022 and declines in the latter half of the year however our gross margin trends are dependent on amounts and timing of inflationary price increases sales growth expectations and product mix 

• we believe that tight labor and real estate markets will present challenges in managing expenses in 2022 however we project that operating expense growth in 2022 will be less than our gross profit growth we expect that our operating expense growth will reflect inflationary increases and incremental costs to support our investment initiatives including increased investments in technology and expansion of our sales center network 

in 2022 we expect our effective tax rate will approximate 255 without the impact of asu 201609 our effective tax rate is dependent upon our results of operations and may change if actual results are different from our current expectations due to asu 201609 requirements we expect our effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter particularly in periods when employees elect to exercise their vested stock options or when restrictions on sharebased awards lapse we estimate that we have approximately 76 million in unrealized excess tax benefits related to stock options that expire and restricted awards that vest in the first quarter of 2022 we may recognize additional tax benefits related to stock option exercises in 2022 from grants that expire in years after 2022 for which we have not included any expected benefits in our guidance the estimated impact related to asu 201609 is subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options we recorded a 300 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2021 related to asu 201609 

we project that 2022 earnings will be in the range of 1719 to 1794 per diluted share including an estimated 019 benefit from asu 201609 during the first quarter of 2022 we expect to continue to use cash to fund opportunistic share repurchases over the next year and to use cash for the payment of cash dividends as and when declared by our board of directors 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the effects of the evolving covid19 pandemic and the extent to which homecentric trends will continue accelerate or reverse the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions changes in the economy consumer discretionary spending or the housing market our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives or mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k also see “cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” prior to the heading “risk factors” in item 1a 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board our critical accounting estimates are discussed below including to the extent material and reasonably available the impact such estimates have had or are reasonably likely to have on our financial condition or results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

similar to our business our customers’ businesses are seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging these reserves range from 005 for amounts currently due to up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts we estimate future losses based upon historical bad debts customer receivable balances age of customer receivable balances customers’ financial conditions and current and forecasted economic trends including certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp we monitor housing market trends through review of the house price index as published by the federal housing finance agency which measures the movement of singlefamily home prices 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 008 of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales approximated 006 in 2021 009 in 2020 and 012 in 2019 we expect that writeoffs will range from 005 to 010 of net sales in 2022 

at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend allowance for doubtful accounts balance to i current year writeoffs and ii any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2021 pretax income would change by approximately 12 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 002 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2021 

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently turn at slower rates 

we classify products at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the expected sellable period which is the previous 12 months for most products except for special order nonstock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage below is a description of these inventory classifications 

• new products with less than 12 months usage 

• highest sales velocity items which represent approximately 80 of net sales at the sales center 

• lower sales velocity items which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service 

• products with no sales for the past 12 months at the local sales center level excluding special order products not yet delivered to the customer and 

• nonstock special order items 

there is little risk of obsolescence for our highest sales velocity items which represent approximately 80 of net sales at the sales center because these products generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory with lower sales velocity and inventory with no sales for the past 12 months which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory at net realizable value we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory with lower sales velocity inventory with no sales for the past 12 months and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess lower sales velocity inventory and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory with no sales for the past 12 months we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months’ usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of total inventory with no sales for the past 12 months we have not changed our methodology from prior years 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

• the level of inventory in relation to historical sales by product including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the sales center level and on a companywide basis 

• changes in customer preferences or regulatory requirements 

• seasonal fluctuations in inventory levels 

• geographic location and 

• superseded products and new product offerings 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend obsolescence reserve balance to i current year inventory writeoffs and ii the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2021 pretax income would change by approximately 30 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 006 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2021 

vendor programs 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors or our net cost of products sold and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor programs as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount earned based on our expectation of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward the attainment of various levels within certain vendor programs we accrue vendor program benefits on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including changes in economic conditions and weather changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors 

we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor program benefits accrual may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase or sales levels in the first quarter of the subsequent year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor credits received to the prior year vendor receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our vendor program estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

we record global intangible low tax income gilti on foreign earnings as period costs if and when incurred although we have not realized any impacts since the december 2017 enactment of us tax reform 

as of december 31 2021 us income taxes were not provided on the earnings or cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the provisions of the transition tax from us tax reform as we have historically invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to fund current cash flow needs in the countries where held additional income tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings and cash balances is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation we determined not to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of us tax reform 

we operate in 39 states 1 united states territory and 11 foreign countries we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities and the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

each year we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns based on this hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate differences between our effective income tax rate and federal and state statutory tax rates are primarily due to changes in valuation allowances recorded for certain of our international subsidiaries with tax losses and excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of deductible nonqualified stock options and the lapse of restrictions on deductible restricted stock awards 

performancebased compensation accrual 

the compensation committee of our board compensation committee and our management have designed compensation programs intended to create a performance culture the primary objectives of our compensation programs are to attract motivate reward and retain our employees without leading to unnecessary risk taking our compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to groups of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans consist of annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including operating income 

we use an annual cash performance award annual bonus to focus corporate behavior on shortterm goals for growth financial performance and other specific financial and business improvement metrics management sets the company’s annual bonus objectives at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year management also establishes specific business improvement objectives for both our operating units and corporate employees the compensation committee approves objectives for annual bonus plans involving executive management 

we also utilize our mediumterm threeyear strategic plan incentive program spip to provide senior management with an additional cashbased payforperformance award based on the achievement of specified earnings growth objectives payouts through the spip are based on threeyear compound annual growth rates cagrs of our diluted eps 

we record annual performancebased compensation accruals based on operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives starting in june and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated performancebased compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans if any 

we record spip accruals based on our total expected eps for the current fiscal year and earnings growth estimates for the succeeding two years we base our current fiscal year estimates on the same assumptions used for our annual bonus calculation and we base our forwardlooking estimates on historical growth trends and our projections for the remainder of the threeyear performance periods 

our quarterly performancebased compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

• differences between estimated and actual performance 

• our projections related to achievement of multipleyear performance objectives for our spip and 

• the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year each year we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year’s end to determine the accuracy of our performancebased compensation estimates based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our performancebased compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate 

business combinations  goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

in december 2021 we acquired porpoise pool  patio inc “porpoise” for 7887 million net of cash acquired based on our preliminary purchase price allocation we recognized tangible assets of 842 million identifiable intangible assets of 3010 million and resulting goodwill of 4035 million 

we used the acquisition method of accounting for this business combination our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of market participants significant assumptions include expected revenue growth rates earnings metrics and discount rates unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the underlying estimates and assumptions we ran sensitivity analyses on the significant assumptions to evaluate our valuations and determined each to be within a range of acceptable estimates 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires judgment our pinch a penny brand name is expected to have an indefinite life as it corresponds with the period of expected future cash flows of the intangible asset we considered the competitive market position historical results macroeconomic environment our operating plans and expected future use of the brand in our network expansion our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are based on the same criteria and correspond with the expected future cash flows the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for additional details see note 3 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k while we believe those estimates and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is our largest intangible asset at december 31 2021 our goodwill balance was 6884 million representing approximately 21 of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we perform a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment to the extent the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value we record a goodwill impairment charge for the difference up to the carrying value of the goodwill we recognize any impairment loss in operating income since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level we define a reporting unit as an individual sales center as of october 1 2021 we had 247 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the most significant goodwill balance for a reporting unit was 121 million and the average goodwill balance was 11 million as of december 31 2021 our most significant goodwill balance for a reporting unit was related to our acquisition of porpoise as discussed above 

in october 2021 2020 and 2019 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not recognize any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level in the first quarter of 2020 we recorded impairment equal to the total goodwill and intangibles carrying amounts of our five australian reporting units which included goodwill impairment of 35 million and intangibles impairment related to the pool systems tradename and trademark of 09 million 

to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we project future cash flows using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates operating margins discount rates and earnings multiples these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium our aggregate estimated fair values fell in line with our market capitalization which we consider to be reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test to facilitate a sensitivity analysis we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate to reflect more conservative discounted cash flow assumptions the sensitivity of a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate our sensitivity analysis generated a fair value estimate below our market capitalization and did not result in the identification of additional atrisk locations 

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted we could incur impairment charges in future periods impairment charges would decrease operating income negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for details 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2021 2020 and 2019 we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



1 base business and total reflect a 25 million note recovery in 2021 and 69 million of impairment from goodwill and other assets recorded in 2020 

we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



when calculating our base business results we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2021 



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 35 compared to 2020 with 29 of this increase resulting from base business sales growth maintenance refurbishment and construction activity remained strong in 2021 as households continued to create and expand homebased outdoor living spaces our sales were driven by robust customer demand for outdoor living products throughout the year and were aided by inflationary benefits and warmer weather trends across most of the united states 

the following factors benefited our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

• strong demand for discretionary products as evidenced by improvements in sales growth rates for product offerings such as equipment and building materials see discussion below 

• increased demand for residential swimming pool maintenance supplies due to earlier pool openings and increased usage as evidenced by improvements in sales growth rates to retail customers see discussion below 

• market share gains including those in building materials see discussion below 

• inflationary product cost increases of approximately 7 to 8 compared to our historical average of 1 to 2 and 

• 6 sales growth from recent acquisitions 

we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings such as equipment and building materials evidence increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas such as pool construction pool remodeling and equipment upgrades in 2021 sales for equipment such as swimming pool heaters pumps lights and filters increased 35 compared to 2020 and collectively represented approximately 29 of net sales this increase reflects both the growth of replacement activity and continued demand for higherpriced more energyefficient products sales of building materials grew 28 compared to 2020 and represented approximately 12 of net sales in 2021 

sales to customers who service large commercial installations and specialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies are included in the appropriate existing product categories and growth in these areas is reflected in the numbers in the paragraph above sales to retail customers increased 20 compared to 2020 and represented approximately 12 of our net sales in 2021 sales to commercial customers increased 24 in 2021 as business and leisure travel improved in 2021 following covid19 related closures in 2020 and demand from commercial customers began to return to normalized prepandemic levels sales to commercial customers represented approximately 3 of our net sales in 2021 

2021 quarterly sales performance compared to 2020 quarterly sales performance 

in each quarter of 2021 sales benefited from continued elevated demand for swimming pool and outdoor living products driven by homecentric and workfromhome trends households continued to invest in their backyards and outdoor living spaces resulting in broad sales gains across many product categories and geographies 



in addition to the sales discussion above see further details of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations below 

gross profit 



gross margin improved 180 basis points to 305 in 2021 compared to 287 in 2020 reflecting benefits from our actions to address inflation and manage supply chain disruptions along with favorable impacts from incentives realized from increased purchase volumes 

operating expenses 



operating expenses including a note recovery in 2021 and impairment charges in 2020 increased 18 or 1174 million to 7843 million in 2021 up from 6669 million in 2020 the majority of the increase in our operating expenses is due to higher compensation costs as we reward our employees through performancebased compensation and increase wages to support stronger demand other incremental operating expense increases relate to increases in growthdriven facility and freight costs in addition to investments in technology 

in the first quarter of 2020 we recorded impairment charges of 69 million which included 25 million from a note and a goodwill and intangibles impairment charge of 44 million in 2021 we recovered the 25 million from the previously impaired note 

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 210 basis points contributing to the 390 basis point expansion in our operating margin for the year driven by a combination of higher yearoveryear sales and improved operating leverage as we utilize our existing network to manage incremental costs for new sales center openings and acquisitions 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net decreased 37 million compared to 2020 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency losses with a loss of 03 million recognized in 2021 compared to a loss of 17 million recognized in 2020 in addition to interest income from a note of 15 million in 2021 interest expense related to borrowings increased approximately 12 million primarily due to higher average interest rates between periods our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 25 in 2021 from 21 in 2020 on consistent average outstanding debt balances 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 211 at december 31 2021 and 189 at december 31 2020 we recorded a 300 million or 074 per diluted share benefit from asu 201609 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to a benefit of 286 million or 070 per diluted share realized in the same period in 2020 without the benefits from asu 201609 our effective tax rate was 247 and 252 for the years ended 2021 and 2020 respectively 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 77 to 6506 million in 2021 compared to 3667 million in 2020 earnings per share increased 78 to 1597 per diluted share compared to 897 per diluted share in 2020 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap measures described below should be considered in the context of all of our other disclosures in this form 10k 

adjusted income statement information 

we have included adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps which are nongaap financial measures as supplemental disclosures because we believe these measures are useful to investors and others in assessing our yearoveryear operating performance 

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps are key measures used by management to eliminate the impact of our noncash and nonrecurring charges and to provide investors and others with additional information about our potential future operating performance to supplement gaap measures 

we believe these measures should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net income and diluted eps presented in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate these nongaap financial measures differently than we do which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures 

the table below presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income 



1 our effective tax rate at march 31 2020 was a 01 benefit without impairment from goodwill and intangibles and tax benefits from asu 201609 recorded in the first quarter of 2020 our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 254 which we used to calculate the tax impact related to the 25 million note impairment

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

for discussion regarding the effects seasonality and weather have on our business see item 1 “business” of this form 10k 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2021 and 2020 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  

weather impacts on fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2020 comparisons 

sales in the first quarter of 2021 benefited from generally mild weather conditions throughout the contiguous united states in february 2021 texas experienced the most costly winter storm event on record for the united states which damaged many swimming pools and added to the existing strong replacement opportunity in that market in contrast sales in the first quarter of 2020 benefited from much aboveaverage temperatures throughout the united states particularly in the southern united states 

overall varied weather conditions in the second quarter of 2021 favorably impacted our sales growth while the southern states saw mild temperatures and aboveaverage precipitation the western states particularly california experienced severely high temperatures and drought the average us temperature in june was the hottest on record in 127 years comparatively in the second quarter of 2020 we observed generally mild weather conditions with warmer weather throughout the western united states 

generally favorable weather conditions benefited sales in the third quarter of 2021 temperatures ranged from aboveaverage to substantially aboveaverage throughout most of the contiguous united states with september being the fifth warmest on record precipitation was belowaverage in most of the western half of the united states and normal to aboveaverage in the eastern half likewise results in the third quarter of 2020 were favorably impacted by aboveaverage temperatures and belowaverage precipitation 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 sales benefited from aboveaverage temperatures throughout much of the contiguous united states particularly in the month of december which was the fifth warmest on record in a 127year period precipitation levels varied with the southern states experiencing levels much below average and the northern states seeing aboveaverage levels similarly sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 benefited from aboveaverage temperatures and belowaverage precipitation

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

• cash flows generated from operating activities 

• the adequacy of available bank lines of credit 

• the quality of our receivables 

• acquisitions 

• dividend payments 

• capital expenditures 

• changes in income tax laws and regulations 

• the timing and extent of share repurchases and 

• the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations debt repayment obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions opening new sales centers dividend payments and share repurchases our primary working capital obligations are for the purchase of inventory payroll rent other facility costs and selling and administrative expenses our working capital obligations fluctuate during the year driven primarily by seasonality and the timing of inventory purchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions we have funded our capital expenditures and share repurchases in substantially the same manner 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent capital structure including a modest amount of debt and returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

• capital expenditures primarily for maintenance and growth of our sales center network technologyrelated investments and fleet vehicles 

• inventory and other operating expenses 

• strategic acquisitions executed opportunistically 

• payment of cash dividends as and when declared by our board 

• repayment of debt to maintain an average total target leverage ratio as defined below between 15 and 20 and 

• repurchases of our common stock under our board authorized share repurchase program 

our capital spending primarily relates to leasehold improvements delivery and service vehicles and information technology we focus our capital expenditure plans on the needs of our sales centers capital expenditures were 07 of net sales in 2021 06 of net sales in 2020 and 10 of net sales in 2019 although our capital spending increased by 160 million in 2021 capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales were lower than our historical average of 10 of net sales due to our significant sales growth capital expenditures in 2020 were lower than our historical average due to costsaving measures implemented at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic 

based on management’s current plans we project capital expenditures for 2022 will continue to approximate the historical average of 1 of net sales we also plan to increase our investment in technology and automation enabling us to operate more efficiently we have initiated a multiyear project to transform our legacy enterprise systems and capabilities to improve customer and team member experiences 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 18 2022 4824 million of the current board authorized amount under our authorized share repurchase plan remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations of 3135 million for 2021 decreased 841 million compared to 2020 the decrease in cash provided by operations is driven by an incremental cash outflow of 3713 million stemming from changes to our net working capital primarily reflecting an increase in inventory partially offset by increases in accounts payable and net income 

cash used in investing activities increased 7033 million in 2021 due to an increase of 6874 million in payments for acquisitions compared to 2020 and a 160 million increase in net capital expenditures between years 

cash provided by financing activities increased 7705 million to 5261 million in 2021 compared to cash used in financing activities of 2444 million in 2020 the increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects a 8653 million increase in net debt proceeds offset by additional share repurchases of 618 million and an increase in dividends paid of 277 million 

for a discussion of our sources and uses of cash in 2019 see the liquidity and capital resources – sources and uses of cash section of management’s discussion and analysis included in part ii item 7 of our 2020 annual report on form 10k 

future sources and uses of cash 

to supplement cash from operations as our primary source of working capital we will continue to utilize our three major credit facilities which are the amended and restated revolving credit facility the credit facility the term facility the term facility and the receivables securitization facility the receivables facility for additional details regarding these facilities see the summary descriptions below and more complete descriptions in note 5 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

credit facility 

our credit facility as amended through december 30 2021 provides for 125 billion in borrowing capacity consisting of a 7500 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility and a 5000 million term loan facility which includes a 2500 million delayeddraw term loan facility and an additional 2500 million incremental term loan facility we drew the 2500 million delayeddraw term loan on december 15 2021 and used the proceeds to fund our acquisition of porpoise pool  patio inc subsequent to december 31 2021 we drew the 2500 million incremental term loan on january 4 2022 and used the same amount to reduce our revolving borrowings the term loans require quarterly amortization payments aggregating to 20 of the original principal amount of the loan during the third fourth and fifth years of the loan with all remaining principal due on the credit facility maturity date of september 25 2026 

the credit facility continues to include a 7500 million revolving credit facility and sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit we intend to continue to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2021 there was 8229 million outstanding a 48 million standby letter of credit outstanding and 4223 million available for borrowing under the credit facility the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2021 was approximately 12 excluding commitment fees 

term facility 

our term facility provides for 1850 million in borrowing capacity and matures on december 30 2026 proceeds from the term facility were used to pay down the credit facility in december 2019 adding borrowing capacity for future share repurchases acquisitions and growthoriented working capital expansion the term facility is repaid in quarterly installments of 1250 of the term facility on the last business day of each quarter beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we classify the entire outstanding balance as longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets as we intend and have the ability to refinance the obligations on a longterm basis the total of the quarterly payments will be equal to 3375 of the term facility with the final principal repayment equal to 6625 of the term facility due on the maturity date we may prepay amounts outstanding under the term facility without penalty other than interest breakage costs 

at december 31 2021 the term facility had an outstanding balance of 1665 million at a weighted average effective interest rate of 29 

financial covenants 

financial covenants of the credit facility and the term facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2021 the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

• maximum average total leverage ratio  on the last day of each fiscal quarter our average total leverage ratio must be less than 325 to 100 average total leverage ratio is the ratio of the trailing twelve months ttm average total funded indebtedness plus the ttm average accounts securitization proceeds divided by the ttm ebitda as those terms are defined in the credit facility as of december 31 2021 our average total leverage ratio equaled 077 compared to 086 as of december 31 2020 and the ttm average total indebtedness amount used in this calculation was 6803 million 

• minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  on the last day of each fiscal quarter our fixed charge ratio must be greater than or equal to 225 to 100 fixed charge ratio is the ratio of the ttm ebitdar divided by ttm interest expense paid or payable in cash plus ttm rental expense as those terms are defined in the credit facility as of december 31 2021 our fixed charge ratio equaled 1176 compared to 781 as of december 31 2020 and ttm rental expense was 808 million 

the credit facility and term facility limit the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to a manner consistent with past practice provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends we may declare and pay quarterly dividends so long as i the amount per share of such dividends is not greater than the most recently publicly announced amount dividends per share and ii our average total leverage ratio is less than 325 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends under the credit facility and term facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 325 to 100 

other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility and the term facility could result in higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

receivables securitization facility 

our twoyear accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility offers us a lowercost form of financing under this facility we can borrow up to 3500 million between april through june and from 1750 million to 3150 million during the remaining months of the year the receivables facility matures on november 1 2023 we classify the entire outstanding balance as longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets as we intend and have the ability to refinance the obligations on a longterm basis 

the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a whollyowned subsidiary the securitization subsidiary the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain thirdparty financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds limited to the applicable funding capacities upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due 

at december 31 2021 there was 1850 million outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 09 excluding commitment fees 

interest rate swaps 

we utilize interest rate swap contracts and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on our variable rate borrowings interest expense related to the notional amounts under all swap contracts is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the respective borrowings 

as of december 31 2021 we had three interest rate swap contracts in place and two forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts each of which has the effect of converting our exposure to variable interest rates on our variable rate borrowings to fixed interest rates for more information see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

compliance and future availability 

as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements under our credit facility our term facility and our receivables facility we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2022 for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

future obligations 

we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes changes in our business needs fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from our estimates we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2021 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowings on our facilities 



the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows 

• longterm debt amounts represent the future principal payments on our debt as of december 31 2021 for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

• operating lease amounts include future rental payments for our operating leases the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases for additional information regarding our operating leases see note 9 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

• purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases and software commitments we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancellable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above 

for certain of our future obligations such as unrecognized tax benefits uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time as such we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from the table above see note 7 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for additional discussion related to our unrecognized tax benefits the table also excludes various other liabilities that are not contractual in nature including contingent liabilities litigation accruals and contract termination fees 

the table below contains estimated interest payments in thousands related to our longterm debt obligations presented in the table above we calculated estimates of future interest payments based on the december 31 2021 outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2021 for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swap contracts to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility the term facility and the receivables facility our actual interest payments could vary substantially from the amounts projected 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2021 there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts the portions of our outstanding balances under the credit facility term facility and the receivables facility that were not covered by our interest rate swap contracts were subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2021 related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the monthly maximum available amount under the credit facility and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility our term facility entered into on december 30 2019 was fully drawn as of that date in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility and the receivables facility increased by 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 122 million and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 022 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2021 the maximum amount available under the credit facility is 125 billion and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility is 3500 million 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

changes in the exchange rates for the functional currencies of our international subsidiaries as shown in the table below may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations including canada and mexico accounted for only 10 of total net sales in 2021 our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2022 and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states our vision is to establish poolcorp as the global digital distribution leader in swimming pool backyard and irrigation and landscape distribution markets the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2020 we operated 398 sales centers in north america europe and australia through our four distribution networks 

• scp distributors scp 

• superior pool products superior 

• horizon distributors horizon and 

• national pool tile npt 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools technological advancements and the development of energyefficient and more aesthetically attractive products additionally the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

• longterm growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern united states where use of the outdoor home environment is more prevalent and extends longer throughout the year 

• increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment 

• consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products with new irrigation systems landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels 

• consumers using more automation and control products higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time and 

• increased consumer spending on homes including outdoor living spaces driven by stayathome and remote work trends 

almost 60 of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining a proper sanitization balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenancerelated goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted consumer discretionary spending including pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2019 pk data inc reports 

the replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25 of consumer spending in the pool industry the activity in this market which includes major swimming pool remodeling is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors including home values singlefamily home sales and consumer confidence that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises just over 15 of consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize similar longterm growth rates irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new singlefamily home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables that drive new home sales however the landscape industry offers similar maintenancerelated growth opportunities as the swimming pool industry product offerings such as chemicals and fertilizers power equipment and related repair and maintenance services offer recurring revenue streams in an industry otherwise closely tied to the housing market the irrigation and landscape distribution business serves both residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market we believe that irrigation accounts for approximately 35  40 of total spending in the industry with the remaining 60  65 of spending related to landscape maintenance products power equipment hardscapes and specialty outdoor products and accessories 

our npt network primarily serves the swimming pool market but does provide some overlap with the irrigation and landscape industries as we offer our marketleading brand of pool tile composite pool finish products and hardscapes as more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand while leveraging our existing pool and irrigation and landscape customer base we feel the development of our npt network is a natural extension of our distribution model in addition to our 21 standalone npt sales centers we currently have over 100 scp and superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where landscape and swimming pool contractors as well as homeowners can view and select pool components including pool tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades and serve as stocking locations for our npt branded products we also offer virtual tools for homeowners to select and design their pool and outdoor environments working with their chosen contractors to install these products we believe our showrooms local stocking of products and virtual support provide us with a competitive advantage in these categories given the more discretionary nature of these products this business is more sensitive to external market factors compared to our business overall 

economic environment 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments equipment replacement landscaping projects and outdoor living space renovations 

we believe that over the long term singlefamily housing turnover and home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and employment levels contractor labor availability has also become an issue in recent years limiting our customers’ ability to fully meet consumer construction and renovation demand 

the market environment from june 2009 when the great recession ended until 2020 when the covid19 pandemicinduced recession began was characterized by steady economic expansion the cautious recovery of consumer spending modest housing recovery and low inflation however in terms of homeowners investing in their existing homes discretionary expenditures including backyard renovations have flourished over this time period with steady increases in home values and lack of affordable new homes prompting homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments including their backyards due to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 many families spent more time at home and sought out opportunities to create or expand existing homebased outdoor living and entertainment spaces which resulted in an increase in new pool construction and greater expenditures for maintenance and remodeling products despite the overall decline in economic activity in the us while we estimate that new pool construction increased from approximately 80000 units in 2019 to approximately 100000 units in 2020 construction levels are still down approximately 55 compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 40 from what we consider normal levels an average of approximately 170000 new units per year were built in the years leading up to the great recession we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate greater growth over the next several years 

times of strong economic conditions in the united states enable further replacement remodeling and new construction activity although some constraints exist around residential construction activities we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry additionally recent regulation passed by the us department of energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps for swimming pools must meet certain compliance regulations by july 2021 this mandate coupled with additional product developments and technological advancements offers further growth opportunities over the next few years 

considering the factors discussed above we believe we will realize annual sales growth rates of approximately 6 to 8 over the next five years 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers creating exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our core strategies are as follows 

• to promote the growth of our industry 

• to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and 

• to continuously strive to operate more effectively 

we promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include digital and media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® wwwhottubscom ® and wwwnptpoolcom ® social media platforms and other digital marketing initiatives including our npt® backyard mobile app we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design product merchandising business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes in addition to these programs we feature consumer showrooms in over 100 of our sales centers and host our annual retail summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry although we did not host our annual retail summit in january 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic we also act as a daytoday resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations we aim to create capacity with business to business development tools and execution to ensure bestinclass service and value creation for our customers and suppliers in particular we have developed the pool360 and horizon 247 platforms that help our customers be more productive by allowing them to get pricing check availability enter orders and make payments online while leveraging our customer service staff resources particularly during peak business periods these tools not only offer realtime integration into our enterprise resource planning system creating efficiencies in our business processes as well but they also provide our customers graphical catalog presentation in the same platform we’ve enhanced our bluestreak mobile order processing which enables our sales associates with wireless technology that puts them next to the customer rather than behind the counter orders are processed faster often eliminating the need for customers to get out of their vehicles we are also actively making improvements to our sales centers and warehouses including improved showroom layouts sales center merchandising and velocity slotting velocity slotting uses technology to identify fast moving high velocity items which are then colorcoded and placed in an easily accessible location to create efficiencies for both our employees and customers in addition to these initiatives we strive to expand our pool corporationbranded products and exclusive brand offerings 

we have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers depending on our market presence and capacity for additional information regarding our new sales center openings acquisitions and closuresconsolidations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in this form 10k 

we plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past ten years we generally pass industry price increases through our supply chain and may make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in order to obtain favorable pricing we estimate that annual price inflation in 2018 and 2020 was consistent with the tenyear average we estimate that annual price inflation in 2019 was approximately 2 above our historical range as we sold through strategic inventory purchases from 2018 we believe that results in 2021 will be impacted by inflationary product cost increases of approximately 2 to 3 compared to our historical average of 1 to 2 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 120000 customers no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales in 2020 most of our customers are small familyowned businesses with relatively limited capital resources most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors and specialty retailers employing no more than ten employees in many cases working alone or with a limited crew these customers also buy from other distributors mass merchants home stores and certain specialty and internet retailers 

we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers for sales under early buy programs the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  allowance for doubtful accounts” for additional information 

we sell our products primarily to the following types of customers 

• swimming pool remodelers and builders 

• specialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies 

• swimming pool repair and service businesses 

• irrigation construction and landscape maintenance contractors and 

• commercial customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities 

we conduct our operations through 398 sales centers in north america europe and australia our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california texas florida and arizona collectively representing approximately 54 of our 2020 net sales in 2020 we generated approximately 94 of our sales in north america including canada and mexico 5 in europe and 1 in australia while we continue to expand both domestically and internationally we expect this geographic mix to be similar over the next few years references to product line and product category data throughout this form 10k generally reflect data related to the north american swimming pool market as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations 

we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 200000 manufacturer and pool corporationbranded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and related products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry we sell the following types of products 

  

• maintenance products such as chemicals supplies and pool accessories 

• repair and replacement parts for pool equipment such as cleaners filters heaters pumps and lights 

• fiberglass pools and hot tubs and packaged pool kits including walls liners braces and coping for inground and aboveground pools 

• pool equipment and components for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools 

• irrigation and related products including irrigation system components and professional lawn care equipment and supplies 

• building materials such as concrete plumbing and electrical components both functional and decorative pool surfaces decking materials tile hardscapes and natural stone used for pool installations and remodeling 

• commercial products including american society of material engineers heaters safety equipment and commercial pumps and filters and 

• other pool construction and recreational products which consist of a number of product categories and include discretionary recreational and related outdoor living products such as hot tubs grills and components for outdoor kitchens that enhance consumers’ use and enjoyment of outdoor living spaces 

we currently have over 600 product lines and approximately 50 product categories based on our 2020 product classifications sales for our pool and hot tub chemicals product category represented approximately 10 of total net sales for 2020 and 12 of total net sales in 2019 and 2018 no other product categories accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets we then evaluate the performance in these markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

recent regulation passed by the us department of energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps sold for swimming pools must meet certain compliance regulations by july 2021 we expect to see minimal impact from this change until midway through the 2021 season new product technology provides opportunities not only for improved energy efficiency but also new enticements for leisure activities smart controls provide growth opportunities as most existing swimming pools run on mechanical time clocks major equipment manufacturers have developed and will continue to develop more retrofit kits that allow homeowners to interact with their pools or hot tubs through their smartphones robotic cleaners offer consumers a more efficient option for maintaining their swimming pools we see each of these developments as significant growth opportunities we offer a growing selection of energyefficient and environmentally preferred products which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy water and money our green technology products include variable speed pumps led pool and hot tub lights and highefficiency heat pumps 

over the last several years we have increased our product offerings and service abilities related to commercial swimming pools we consider the commercial market to be a key growth opportunity as we focus more attention on providing products to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities while we are leveraging our existing networks and relationships to grow this market in 2017 we also acquired lincoln equipment inc a national distributor of equipment and supplies to commercial and institutional swimming pool customers sales to commercial customers declined in 2020 due to covid19 related closures and the decline in both business and leisure travel we expect commercial sales to improve as covid19 pandemic conditions ease 

in 2020 the sale of maintenance and minor repair products nondiscretionary accounted for almost 60 of our sales and gross profits while just over 40 of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools partially discretionary during the economic downturn which spanned from late 2006 to early 2010 and reached its low point in 2009 sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction and deferred remodeling and replacement activity the current trend reflects a partial shift back toward a greater percentage of our sales coming from major refurbishment and replacement products due to the recovery of these activities since levels reached their historic low point in 2009 

post2009 we experienced product and customer mix changes including a shift in consumer spending to some higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps and high efficiency heaters in 2020 we experienced higher sales of lower margin bigticket items such as pool equipment and inground and aboveground pools these products positively contribute to our sales and gross profit growth but negatively impact our gross margin we expect continued demand for these products but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives including growth in our higher margin private label and exclusive products plex and our expansion of building materials product offerings have helped offset these gross margin declines and will lead to somewhat flat or slightly lower gross margin trends over the next few years 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool market primarily to offer our customers a choice of distinctive product selections locations and service personnel 

we distribute irrigation and related products through our horizon network and tile decking materials and interior pool finish products through our npt network as well as through scp and superior networks we evaluate our sales centers based on their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs human resources support information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or thirdparty carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions for additional information regarding our inventory management see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  inventory obsolescence” of this form 10k 

we also operate four centralized shipping locations csls in the united states that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and landscape products and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool corporation which are referred to as early buy purchases these early buy purchases typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors offering the best overall terms and service to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  vendor programs” for additional information 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair plc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20 10 and 9 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2020 

competition 

we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products based on industry knowledge and available data and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies we also face competition both directly and indirectly from mass market retailers both storebased and internet and large pool supply retailers who primarily buy directly from manufacturers 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of california texas florida and arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply distribution are 

• the breadth and availability of products offered 

• the quality and level of customer service including ease of ordering and product delivery 

• the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs 

• consistency and stability of business relationships with customers and suppliers 

• competitive product pricing and 

• geographic proximity to the customer 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of swimming pool use pool and irrigation installation and remodeling and repair activities sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters in 2020 we generated approximately 61 of our net sales and 76 of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the late spring and summer primarily because extended terms offered by our suppliers are typically payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions

cautionary statement for purposes of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of earnings and other financial performance measures statements of management’s expectations regarding our plans and objectives and industry general economic and other forecasts of trends future dividend payments share repurchases and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” “may” “can” “plan” “target” “potential” “should” and other words and expressions of similar meaning 

no assurance can be given that the expected results in any forwardlooking statement will be achieved and actual results may differ materially due to one or more factors for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statement are described below investors should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks discussed below are not the only risks we face other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business if they occur moreover new risks emerge from time to time further our business may also be affected by additional factors that generally apply to all companies operating in the us and globally which have not been included 

risks relating to macroeconomic conditions 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation landscape and related outdoor living products may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

consumer discretionary spending affects our sales and is impacted by factors outside of our control including general economic conditions the residential housing market unemployment rates and wage levels interest rate fluctuations inflation disposable income levels consumer confidence and access to credit in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation landscape and related outdoor living products may decline often corresponding with declines in discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction maintenance and repair products and certain replacement and refurbishment products are required to maintain existing swimming pools and each currently accounts for approximately 60 and 25 of net sales related to our swimming pool business however the growth in this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbishment activity even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pools irrigation systems and outdoor living products between late 2006 and early 2010 the unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems although we have seen improvement since 2010 tightening consumer credit could prevent consumers from obtaining financing for pool irrigation and related outdoor projects which could negatively impact our sales of constructionrelated products 

the covid19 pandemic and associated responses could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets throughout the world in response governmental authorities have imposed and others in the future may impose stayathome orders shelterinplace orders quarantines executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions to control the spread of covid19 such orders or restrictions have resulted in temporary store closures limitation of store hours limitations on the number of people in stores or in warehouses enhanced requirements on sanitation social distancing practices and travel restrictions among other effects in almost all of our markets we are designated as an essential business under the relevant state and local regulations and have been allowed to remain open however if this changes it could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results our sales in march and april 2020 were adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and in the first quarter of 2020 we recorded impairment charges of 69 million related to the pandemic for additional information see note 3 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k  during 2020 there were declines followed by resurgences of covid19 cases throughout the us and cases generally rose during the fourth quarter in december 2020 the first covid19 vaccines were approved for use in the us and the early stages of distribution of the vaccine are in process as of the date of this report recently variants of the virus that causes covid19 have been identified in the us and elsewhere and information about them is rapidly emerging including how easily they might spread whether they could cause more severe illness and whether currently authorized vaccines will protect against them accordingly covid19 may have negative impacts on our business in the future and any future adverse impacts on our business may be worse than we anticipate impacts from the covid19 pandemic coupled with heightened demand could also adversely impact our supply chain making it difficult to source and receive products needed to keep our customers adequately supplied the ultimate impact will depend on the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic and any future resurgences and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response including the distribution and acceptance of vaccines each of which is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict in addition our recent growth rates driven by homecentric trends influenced by the covid19 pandemic may not be sustainable and may not be indicative of future growth rates 

risks relating to our business and industry 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

given the nature of our business weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business and the effect of seasonality has a significant impact on our results in 2020 we generated approximately 61 of our net sales and 76 of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of swimming pool use pool and irrigation installation and remodeling and repair activities unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can have an adverse impact on demand due to decreased swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as decreased irrigation installations while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions such restrictions could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations which could negatively impact our sales 

certain extreme weather events such as hurricanes tropical storms and wildfires may impact our ability to deliver our services or cause damage to our facilities as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events we may experience interruption to our operations increased costs or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however any failure to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair plc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20 10 and 9 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2020 a decision by our largest suppliers acting individually or in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally if our suppliers experience difficulties or disruptions in their operations including due to the covid19 pandemic or if we lose a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers we may experience increased supply costs or may experience delays in establishing replacement supply sources that meet our quality and control standards and may lose revenue 

we depend on a global network of suppliers to source our products including our own branded products and products we have exclusive distribution rights to product quality warranty claims or safety concerns could negatively impact our sales and expose us to litigation 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation and pool systems pty ltd branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our business if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks as well as governmental enforcement actions actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including healthrelated concerns could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

within our industry we directly compete against various regional and local distributors as they compete against our customers for the business of pool owners and other enduse customers we indirectly compete against mass market retailers and large pool or irrigation supply retailers as they purchase the great majority of their needs directly from manufacturers and to a lesser extent with internet retailers as they purchase the majority of their needs from distributors outside of our industry we compete indirectly with alternative suppliers of big ticket consumer discretionary products such as boat and motor home distributors and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry which has led to highly competitive markets consisting of varioussized entities ranging from small or local operators to large regional businesses given the density and demand for pool products some geographic markets that we serve also tend to have a higher concentration of competitors than others particularly california texas florida and arizona these states encompass our four largest markets and represented approximately 54 of our net sales in 2020 

more aggressive competition by store and internetbased mass merchants and large pool or irrigation supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and irrigation related products has remained relatively constant should store‑ and internetbased mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or irrigation industries or increase the breadth of their pool and irrigation and related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or irrigation supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel this includes succession planning related to our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

given the seasonal nature of our business we may hire additional employees during the summer months including seasonal and parttime employees who generally are not employed during the offseason if we are unable to attract and hire additional personnel during the peak season our operating results could be negatively impacted 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through organic market share gains new sales center openings and acquisitions that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution our various business strategies and initiatives including our growth initiatives are subject to business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control while we contemplate continued growth through internal expansion and acquisitions no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

• penetrate new markets 

• generate sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and general operating activities 

• obtain financing 

• identify appropriate acquisition candidates and successfully integrate acquired businesses 

• maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships and 

• identify and divest assets which do not continue to create value consistent with our objectives 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our results in 2020 were positively impacted by homecentric trends resulting from the covid19 pandemic these trends may not continue or may reverse which could adversely impact our results of operations in addition in recent years our customers have had difficulty employing a sufficient number of qualified individuals to keep up with the demand for pool maintenance refurbishment and installation if this trend continues or accelerates our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to inventory management risks insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may negatively impact our gross margin 

we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing customer or consumer requirements and fluctuating commodity prices in order to successfully manage our inventories we must estimate demand from our customers and purchase products that substantially correspond to consumer demand if we overestimate demand and purchase too much of a particular product we face a risk that the price of that product will fall leaving us with inventory that we cannot sell at normal profit margins in addition we may have to write down such inventory if we are unable to sell it for its recorded value if we underestimate demand and purchase insufficient quantities of products inventory shortages could result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available if we maintain insufficient inventory levels and prices rise for these products we could be forced to purchase products at higher prices and forego profitability in order to meet customer demand our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if either or both of these situations occur frequently or in large volumes 

the cost of chemical products could increase our cost of sales and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

based on our 2020 product classifications sales for our pool and hot tub chemicals product category represented approximately 10 of total net sales for 2020 and 12 of total net sales in 2019 and 2018 our principal chemical products are granular chlorine compounds and liquid chlorine which are commodity materials the prices of these chemical products are a function of among other things manufacturing capacity and demand we have generally passed through chlorine price increases to our customers the price of granular chlorine compounds and liquid chlorine may increase in the future and we may not be able to pass on any such increase to our customers we purchase chlorine products primarily from the largest domestic suppliers the alternate sources of supply we currently view as reliable may ultimately be unable to supply us with all of our principal chemical products including chlorine products additionally significant price fluctuations or shortages in our principal chemical products may increase our cost of sales and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with employment environmental health transportation safety and other governmental regulations our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state local and international employment environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees or other wage labor or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business and adversely impact our results of operations 

we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing management has processes in place to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements however failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in investigations the assessment of administrative civil and criminal fines damages seizures disgorgements penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to regulatory matters in amounts that may be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 

the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulations is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemicals increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase our attempts to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and our plans to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance may not be as effective as we anticipate 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustibles and oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our ability to successfully conduct operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations which accounted for 9 of our total net sales in 2020 expose us to certain additional risks including 

• difficulty in staffing international subsidiary operations 

• different political economic and regulatory conditions 

• local laws and customs 

• currency fluctuations 

• adverse tax consequences and 

• dependence on other economies 

for foreignsourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

changes in tax laws and accounting standards related to tax matters have caused and may in the future cause fluctuations in our effective tax rate 

taxation and tax policy changes tax rate changes new tax laws revised tax law interpretations and changes in accounting standards and guidance related to tax matters may cause fluctuations in or adversely affect our effective tax rate our effective tax rate may also be impacted by changes in the geographic mix of our earnings 

in the first quarter of 2017 we adopted accounting standards update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  on a prospective basis our projections of financial statement impacts related to asu 201609 are subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options excess tax benefits or deficiencies recognized under asu 201609 vary from quarter to quarter and past results may not be indicative of future results 

risks relating to technology cybersecurity and data privacy 

we rely on information technology systems to support our business operations a significant disturbance or breach of our technological infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally failure to maintain the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

information technology supports several aspects of our business including among others product sourcing pricing customer service transaction processing financial reporting collections and cost management our ability to operate effectively on a daytoday basis and accurately report our results depends on a solid technological infrastructure which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats we are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunication failures internet failures security breaches and other catastrophic events exposure to various types of cyberattacks such as malware computer viruses worms or other malicious acts as well as human error could also potentially disrupt our operations or result in a significant interruption in the delivery of our goods and services 

we are making and expect to continue to make investments in technology to maintain and update our computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives as well as providing training and support for those initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency advances in computer and software capabilities encryption technology and other discoveries increase the complexity of our technological environment including how each interact with our various software platforms such advances could delay or hinder our ability to process transactions or could compromise the integrity of our data resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations we also may experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our information systems unavailable or slow to respond including the interaction of our information systems with those of third parties a lack of sophistication or reliability of our information systems could adversely impact our operations and customer service and could require major repairs or replacements resulting in significant costs and foregone revenue 

the european union and other international regulators as well as state governments have recently enacted or enhanced data privacy regulations such as the california consumer privacy act and other governments are considering establishing similar or stronger protections these regulations impose certain obligations for handling specified personal information in our systems and for apprising individuals of the information we have collected about them despite our best efforts to comply any noncompliance could result in incurring potential substantial penalties and reputational damage 

our numerous procedures and protocols designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks including processes to timely notify appropriate personnel for assessment and resolution and companywide training programs our investments in information technology security and our updates to our business continuity plan may not prevent or effectively mitigate adverse consequences from cybersecurity risks the failure to maintain security over and prevent unauthorized access to our data our customers’ personal information including credit card information or data belonging to our suppliers could put us at a competitive disadvantage such a breach could result in damage to our reputation and subject us to potential litigation liability fines and penalties resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

general risk factors 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined 

borrowings under our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility term facility accounts receivable securitization facility and our derivatives instruments are indexed to the london interbank offering rate “libor” in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the regulatory authority over libor stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor with the support of the united states federal reserve and the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of usd libor on december 31 2021 for only the one week and two month usd libor tenors and on june 30 2023 for all other usd libor tenors while this announcement extends the transition period to june 2023 the united states federal reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new usd libor issuances by the end of 2021 the full impact of the transition away from libor including the discontinuance of libor publication and the adoption of a replacement rate for libor remains unclear these changes may have an adverse impact on our financing costs and any floating rate indebtedness we may incur 

disruptions from natural or manmade disasters or extreme weather public safety issues geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events could have a material adverse effect on our business 

natural or manmade disasters or extreme weather including as a result of climate change public safety issues geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks armed hostilities or insurrections labor or trade disputes and similar events can lead to uncertainty and have a negative impact on demand for our products in addition to causing disruptions to our supply chain discretionary spending is generally adversely affected during times of economic social or political uncertainty the potential for natural or manmade disasters or extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for a discussion of our base business calculations see the results of operations section below 

2020 financial overview 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the novel coronavirus disease covid19 a pandemic and on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency states and cities have taken various measures in response to covid19 including mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings most of our north american operations are and have been continuously open for business as we are designated as an essential business in almost all of our markets our operations in europe closed for a short period during the first half of 2020 in france spain and italy in order to comply with local authorities’ orders our products are used to maintain and protect outdoor commercial residential and municipal environments through chemicallybalanced virus and bacteriafree swimming pool water we also supply products used in the prevention of runoff flood fire and other natural disasters these products are essential to the health and safety of the general public as a result our supply chain generally remains intact with our customers continuing to meet enduser needs 

the health safety and security of our employees has been and remains one of our highest priorities we have adapted our operations and implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer sales center environment for both our customers and employees which includes following best practices and guidelines from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc we implemented enhanced hygiene and sanitation practices at our sales centers and at our corporate offices in limited instances we have had to close facilities in whole or in part as a result of government regulations as well as positive or presumed positive results from covid19 testing the direct impact of any closures did not have a material impact on our operations 

beginning in the middle of march 2020 when stayathome orders related to the covid19 pandemic were initially issued we experienced sales declines across most markets however as stayathome restrictions eased in late april through early may our business not only rebounded but accelerated we experienced unprecedented demand as families spent more time at home and sought out opportunities to create or expand existing homebased outdoor living and entertainment spaces resulting in broad sales gains across nearly all of our product categories and geographies while the shortterm impact of this trend has had a positive impact on our business it is unclear what the longterm impact will be in addition governmental restrictions have had a material impact on some of our customers limiting their ability to operate in certain geographies from midmarch into midmay while these restrictions were lifted new stayathome orders or other government mandates could have a material impact on our results 

our balance sheet is strong with low leverage and sufficient access to additional capital given the seasonality of our business our warehouses were stocked with inventory in preparation for the upcoming peak season prior to the implementation of most stayathome orders as a result the limited vendor supply interruptions experienced in 2020 have had a minimal impact on our business supply disruptions have largely been limited to categories with the greatest demand including heatrelated equipment and aboveground swimming pools and have not been material to our business we continue to work closely with our suppliers to maintain the flow of essential products to provide customers with the materials they need to serve their communities 

given the uncertainties caused by the covid19 pandemic we began taking steps in april to reduce both capital expenditures and operating costs as a result capital expenditures in 2020 were 217 million which is approximately 65 of 2019 capital expenditures we specifically reduced operating costs for labor fuel utilities advertising meetings travel and entertainment as our business outlook and market trends improved since the implementation of these costsaving measures we continue to assess our discretionary spending 

the impact of the ongoing pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to vary by location and depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict these factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic global economic conditions during and after the pandemic governmental actions that have been taken or may be taken in the future in response to the pandemic and changes in customer and supplier behavior in response to the pandemic 

financial results 

net sales increased 23 to 39 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 32 billion in 2019 while base business sales increased 22 we realized broad sales gains across nearly all product categories our sales benefited from greater swimming pool usage and high demand for residential pool products which was driven by homecentric trends influenced by the covid19 pandemic and aided by warmer weather conditions during the year 

gross profit reached 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 a 22 increase over gross profit of 9249 million in 2019 gross margin declined 20 basis points to 287 in 2020 compared to 289 in 2019 the decline in gross margin is primarily due to sales of lower margin bigticket items such as pool equipment and inground and aboveground pools which comprised a larger portion of our product mix in 2020 compared to 2019 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses increased 14 or 832 million to 6669 million in 2020 up from 5837 million in 2019 with base business operating expenses up 12 over 2019 the increase in operating expenses primarily reflects a 439 million increase in performancebased compensation from 243 million in 2019 to 682 million in 2020 and expenses of 169 million from recently acquired businesses excluding 69 million of impairment charges we recorded in the first quarter of 2020 and performancebased compensation in both periods adjusted operating expenses increased 6 reflecting growthdriven labor and freight expenses and greater facilityrelated costs partially offset by lower discretionary spending 

operating income for the year increased 36 to 4640 million up from 3412 million in 2019 operating margin increased 110 basis points to 118 in 2020 compared to 107 in 2019 

we recorded a 286 million or 070 per diluted share benefit from accounting standards update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to a benefit of 235 million or 057 per diluted share realized in 2019 

net income increased 40 to 3667 million in 2020 compared to 2616 million in 2019 earnings per share increased 40 to a record 897 per diluted share compared to 640 per diluted share in 2019 excluding the impact of noncash impairments net of tax in 2020 and the impact from asu 201609 in both periods adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 44 to 842 in 2020 compared to 583 in 2019 see the reconciliation of gaap to nongaap measures included in results of operations below 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations was 3976 million in 2020 which helped fund the following initiatives 

• payments of 1246 million for acquisitions 

• net debt repayments of 958 million 

• quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders totaling 919 million for the year 

• share repurchases totaling 762 million for the year 

• net capital expenditures of 217 million and 

• growth in net working capital of 211 million 

total net receivables including pledged receivables increased 28 compared to december 31 2019 reflecting december sales growth and partially offset by improved collections our allowance for doubtful accounts was 48 million at december 31 2020 and 55 million at december 31 2019 our days sales outstanding ratio as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis was 265 days at december 31 2020 and 290 days at december 31 2019 

inventory levels grew 11 to 7810 million at december 31 2020 compared to 7023 million at december 31 2019 reflecting business growth and inventory from acquired businesses of 422 million our reserve for inventory obsolescence was 114 million at december 31 2020 compared to 90 million at december 31 2019 our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis were 38 times at december 31 2020 and 32 times at december 31 2019 

accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased 829 million to 1437 million in 2020 primarily reflecting increases in accrued performancebased compensation unrealized losses on interest rate swaps and deferred payroll tax payments 

total debt outstanding of 4160 million at december 31 2020 decreased 954 million or 19 compared to december 31 2019 as we have utilized our operating cash flows to decrease debt balances 

current trends and outlook 

due to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 families spent more time at home and sought out opportunities to create or expand existing homebased outdoor living and entertainment spaces which resulted in an increase in new pool construction and greater expenditures for maintenance and remodeling products we believe that increased consumer spending on homes including outdoor living spaces will continue in 2021 and may have longer term benefits as workfromhome trends persist or increase 

the market environment from june 2009 when the great recession ended until 2020 when the covid19 pandemicinduced recession began was characterized by steady economic expansion the cautious recovery of consumer spending modest housing recovery and low inflation however in terms of homeowners investing in their existing homes discretionary expenditures including backyard renovations have flourished over this time period with steady increases in home values and lack of affordable new homes prompting homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments including their backyards we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally constrained by availability of construction labor but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate continued growth over the next several years 

although some constraints exist around residential construction activities we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent long term growth opportunities in our industry additionally recent regulation passed by the us department of energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps for swimming pools must meet certain compliance regulations by july 2021 this mandate coupled with additional product developments and technological advancements offers further growth opportunities over the next few years 

in 2020 we benefited from strong pool construction trends as robust demand fueled by the covid19 pandemic led to increased home investment trends while we estimate that new pool construction increased from approximately 80000 units in 2019 to approximately 100000 new units in 2020 construction levels are still down approximately 55 compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 40 from what we consider normal levels favorable weather plays a role in industry growth by accelerating growth in any given year expanding the number of available construction days extending the pool season and pool usage and positively impacting demand for discretionary products conversely unfavorable weather impedes growth in establishing our outlook each year we base our growth assumptions on normal weather conditions and do not incorporate alternative weather predictions into our guidance 

we established our initial outlook for 2021 based on reasonable expectations of organic market share growth ongoing leverage of existing investments in our business and continuous process improvements for 2021 we expect strong growth in the first half of the year particularly the first quarter of 2021 due to continued elevated demand influenced by the ongoing covid19 pandemic in the second half of the year we expect to face tougher yearoveryear comparisons and inherent industry capacity constraints although we remain encouraged by positive industry outlooks 

impacts from the covid19 pandemic coupled with heightened demand could also adversely impact our supply chain making it difficult to source and receive products needed to keep our customers adequately supplied we anticipate that we may face product shortages or elevated prices specifically related to trichlor a popular sanitizer for pools and hot tubs as the industry faces constraints resulting from the loss of a major supplier due to a fire in the summer of 2020 although supply constraints did not have a material impact on our business in 2020 it is difficult to predict the extent to which this could impact our business in 2021 

we expect to continue to gain market share through our comprehensive service and product offerings which we continually diversify through internal sourcing initiatives and expansion into new markets we also plan to broaden our geographic presence by opening 8 to 10 new sales centers in 2021 and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise 

the following summarizes our outlook for 2021 

• we expect sales growth of 8 to 12 impacted by the following factors and assumptions 

◦ normal weather patterns for 2021 

◦ continued elevated demand for residential pool products driven by homecentric trends influenced by the covid19 pandemic 

◦ a benefit from construction backlogs depending on our customers’ building capacity including the availability of labor and weather 

◦ estimated 4 to 5 growth from acquisitions completed throughout 2020 

◦ market share gains 

◦ inflationary product cost increases of approximately 2 to 3 compared to our historical average of 1 to 2 and 

◦ estimated 2 growth in the installed base of pools 

• we expect gross margin to decline 20 to 40 basis points for the full year of 2021 compared to the full year of 2020 with gains or relatively neutral gross margin trends in the first half of 2021 and declines in the latter half of 2021 

• we expect operating expenses will grow at approximately 60 to 70 of the rate of our gross profit growth reflecting inflationary increases and incremental costs to support our sales growth expectations with greater growth in the first half of the year and more modest growth in the back half the main challenges in achieving this metric include managing people and facility costs in tight labor and real estate markets however we continue to see significant opportunity to leverage our existing infrastructure to achieve this goal we also expect performancebased compensation for the full year of 2021 to normalize and decrease by approximately 300 million compared to the full year of 2020 

in 2021 we expect our effective tax rate will approximate 255 excluding the impact of asu 201609 our effective tax rate is dependent upon our results of operations and may change if actual results are different from our current expectation due to asu 201609 requirements we expect our effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter particularly in periods when employees elect to exercise their vested stock options or when restrictions on sharebased awards lapse based on our december 31 2020 stock price we estimate that we have approximately 45 million in unrealized excess tax benefits related to stock options that expire and restricted awards that vest in the first quarter of 2021 we may recognize additional tax benefits related to stock option exercises in 2021 from grants that expire in years after 2021 for which we have not included any expected benefits in our guidance the estimated impact related to asu 201609 is subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options we recorded a 286 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2020 related to asu 201609 

we project that 2021 earnings will be in the range of 912 to 962 per diluted share including an estimated 011 benefit from asu 201609 during the first quarter of 2021 we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal year 2021 we expect to continue to use cash to fund opportunistic share repurchases over the next year we also expect to use cash for the payment of cash dividends as and when declared by our board of directors 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the effects of the evolving covid19 pandemic the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions changes in the economy and the housing market our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k also see “cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” prior to the heading “risk factors” in item 1a 

critical accounting estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board our critical accounting estimates are discussed below including to the extent material and reasonably available the impact such estimates have had or are reasonably likely to have on our financial condition or results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

similar to our business our customers’ businesses are seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging these reserves range from 005 for amounts currently due to up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts we estimate future losses based upon historical bad debts customer receivable balances age of customer receivable balances customers’ financial conditions and current and forecasted economic trends including certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp we monitor housing market trends through review of the house price index as published by the federal housing finance agency which measures the movement of singlefamily house prices 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 008 of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales approximated 009 in 2020 012 in 2019 and 007 in 2018 we expect that writeoffs will range from 005 to 010 of net sales in 2021 

at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend allowance for doubtful accounts balance to i current year writeoffs and ii any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2020 pretax income would change by approximately 10 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 002 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2020 

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently turn at slower rates 

we classify products at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the expected sellable period which is the previous 12 months for most products except for special order nonstock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage below is a description of these inventory classifications 

• new products with less than 12 months usage 

• highest sales velocity items which represent approximately 80 of net sales at the sales center 

• lower sales velocity items which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service 

• products with no sales for the past 12 months at the local sales center level excluding special order products not yet delivered to the customer and 

• nonstock special order items 

there is little risk of obsolescence for our highest sales velocity items which represent approximately 80 of net sales at the sales center because these products generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory with lower sales velocity and inventory with no sales for the past 12 months which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory at net realizable value we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory with lower sales velocity inventory with no sales for the past 12 months and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess lower sales velocity inventory and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory with no sales for the past 12 months we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months’ usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of total inventory with no sales for the past 12 months we have not changed our methodology from prior years 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

• the level of inventory in relation to historical sales by product including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the sales center level and on a companywide basis 

• changes in customer preferences or regulatory requirements 

• seasonal fluctuations in inventory levels 

• geographic location and 

• superseded products and new product offerings 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend obsolescence reserve balance to i current year inventory writeoffs and ii the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2020 pretax income would change by approximately 23 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 004 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2020 

vendor programs 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors or our net cost of products sold and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor programs as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount earned based on our expectation of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward the attainment of various levels within certain vendor programs we accrue vendor program benefits on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including changes in economic conditions and weather changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors 

we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor program benefits accrual may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase or sales levels in the first quarter of the subsequent year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor credits received to the prior year vendor receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our vendor program estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

we record global intangible low tax income gilti on foreign earnings as period costs if and when incurred although we not have realized any impacts since the enactment of us tax reform enacted in december 2017 

as of december 31 2020 us income taxes were not provided on the earnings or cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the provisions of the transition tax from us tax reform as we have historically invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to fund current cash flow needs in the countries where held additional income tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings and cash balances is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation we determined not to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of us tax reform  

we operate in 39 states 1 united states territory and 11 foreign countries we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities and the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

each year we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns based on this hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate differences between our effective income tax rate and federal and state statutory tax rates are primarily due to valuation allowances recorded for certain of our international subsidiaries with tax losses 

performancebased compensation accrual 

the compensation committee of our board compensation committee annually reviews our compensation structure to oversee management’s implementation of maintaining a program that attracts retains develops and motivates employees without leading to unnecessary risk taking our compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including operating income and diluted earnings per share eps 

we use an annual cash performance award annual bonus to focus corporate behavior on shortterm goals for growth financial performance and other specific financial and business improvement metrics management sets the company’s annual bonus objectives at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year management also establishes specific business improvement objectives for both our operating units and corporate employees the compensation committee approves objectives for annual bonus plans involving executive management 

we also utilize our mediumterm threeyear strategic plan incentive program spip to provide senior management with an additional cashbased payforperformance award based on the achievement of specified earnings growth objectives payouts through the spip are based on threeyear compound annual growth rates cagrs of our diluted eps 

we record annual performancebased compensation accruals based on operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives starting in june and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated performancebased compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans if any 

we record spip accruals based on our total expected eps for the current fiscal year and earnings growth estimates for the succeeding two years we base our current fiscal year estimates on the same assumptions used for our annual bonus calculation and we base our forwardlooking estimates on historical growth trends and our projections for the remainder of the threeyear performance periods 

our quarterly performancebased compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

• differences between estimated and actual performance 

• our projections related to achievement of multipleyear performance objectives for our spip and 

• the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year each year we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous years end to determine the accuracy of our performancebased compensation estimates based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our performancebased compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is our largest intangible asset at december 31 2020 our goodwill balance was 2682 million representing approximately 15 of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we perform a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment to the extent the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value we record a goodwill impairment charge for the difference up to the carrying value of the goodwill we recognize any impairment loss in operating income 

since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level we define a reporting unit as an individual sales center as of october 1 2020 we had 226 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the most significant goodwill balance for a reporting unit was 57 million and the average goodwill balance was 09 million 

in october of 2020 2019 and 2018 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not recognize any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 

in the first quarter of 2020 we determined certain impairment triggers for our australian reporting units had occurred due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on expected future operating cash flows we performed interim goodwill impairment analyses which included discounted cash flow analyses and determined that the estimated fair values of our australian reporting units no longer exceeded their carrying values in the period ended march 31 2020 we recorded impairment equal to the total goodwill and intangibles carrying amounts of our five australian reporting units which included goodwill impairment of 35 million and intangibles impairment related to the pool systems tradename and trademark of 09 million 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows we project future cash flows using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates operating margins discount rates and earnings multiples these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium our aggregate estimated fair values fell in line with our market capitalization which we consider to be reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test to facilitate a sensitivity analysis we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate to reflect more conservative discounted cash flow assumptions the sensitivity of a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate our sensitivity analysis generated a fair value estimate below our market capitalization and resulted in the identification of no additional atrisk locations 

based on our 2020 goodwill impairment analysis we consider one of our horizon reporting units in california as most at risk for goodwill impairment due to marginal results in recent years the most sensitive assumptions related to our fair value for this location relates to future projected operating results and management’s ability to effectively manage costs as of december 31 2020 our aggregate goodwill balance for this reporting unit was 14 million 

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted we could incur impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting unit discussed above impairment charges would decrease operating income negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for details 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2020 2019 and 2018 we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



1 base business and total include 69 million of impairment from goodwill and other assets recorded in the first quarter of 2020 

we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



1 we acquired certain distribution assets of each of these companies 

when calculating our base business results we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2020 



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 23 compared to 2019 with 22 of this increase resulting from base business sales growth as the pandemic forced families to spend more time at home in 2020 they sought out opportunities to create or expand existing homebased outdoor living and entertainment spaces this created unprecedented demand throughout our markets and we realized broad sales gains across nearly all product categories our sales benefited from greater swimming pool usage high demand for residential pool products and warmer weather conditions during the year 

the following factors benefited our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

• strong demand for discretionary products as evidenced by improvements in sales growth rates for product offerings such as equipment building materials and aboveground pools and hot tubs see discussion below 

• increased demand for residential swimming pool maintenance supplies due to earlier pool openings and increased usage as evidenced by improvements in sales growth rates to retail customers see discussion below 

• market share gains including those in building materials see discussion below 

• inflationary product cost increases of approximately 1 to 2 

• 1 sales growth from recent acquisitions and 

• 1 sales growth from an additional selling day in 2020 compared to 2019 

we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings such as equipment building materials and aboveground pools and hot tubs evidence increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas such as pool construction pool remodeling and equipment upgrades in 2020 sales for equipment such as swimming pool heaters pumps lights and filters increased 31 compared to 2019 and collectively represented approximately 29 of net sales this increase reflects both the growth of replacement activity and continued demand for higherpriced more energyefficient products sales of building materials which includes tile and sales from recently acquired master tile locations grew 23 compared to 2019 and represented approximately 12 of net sales in 2020 sales of aboveground pools increased 57 in 2020 compared to 2019 and represented approximately 1 of net sales in 2020 

sales to customers who service large commercial installations and specialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies are included in the appropriate existing product categories and growth or decline in these areas are reflected in the numbers above sales to retail customers increased 24 compared to 2019 and represented approximately 13 of our net sales in 2020 sales to commercial customers declined 10 in 2020 driven by covid19 related closures and the decline in both business and leisure travel sales to commercial customers represented approximately 4 of our net sales in 2020 

2020 quarterly sales performance compared to 2019 quarterly sales performance 

• strong demand for discretionary products during the first quarter of 2020 led to net sales and base business sales growth of 13 sales were also favorably impacted by an additional selling day in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019 

• net sales and base business sales increased 14 in the second quarter of 2020 as stayathome restrictions eased in late april through early may and sales benefited from greater swimming pool demand and usage resulting in broad sales gains across many product categories and geographies 

• in the third quarter of 2020 net sales and base business sales increased 27 and benefited from continued elevated demand for residential pool products driven by homecentric trends influenced by the covid19 pandemic 

• net sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 44 while base business sales increased 39 sales benefited from continued stayathome trends combined with favorable weather nationwide and acquisitions which added 4 to sales growth 

in addition to the sales discussion above see further details of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations below 

gross profit 



gross margin declined 20 basis points to 287 in 2020 compared to 289 in 2019 primarily due to sales of lower margin bigticket items such as pool equipment and inground and aboveground pools which comprised a larger portion of our product mix in 2020 compared to 2019 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 14 or 832 million to 6669 million in 2020 up from 5837 million in 2019 while base business operating expenses grew 12 the increase in operating expenses primarily reflects a 439 million increase in performancebased compensation from 243 million in 2019 to 682 million in 2020 and expenses of 169 million from recently acquired businesses 

in the first quarter of 2020 we recorded impairment charges of 69 million which included noncash goodwill and intangibles impairment charges of 44 million equal to the total goodwill and intangibles carrying amounts of our australian reporting units and 25 million from a longterm note as collectability was impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

excluding impairment charges and performancebased compensation in both periods adjusted operating expenses were up 6 reflecting growthdriven labor and freight expenses and greater facilityrelated costs partially offset by lower discretionary spending as a result of strong expense control and our ability to leverage our existing network operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 130 basis points contributing to the 110 basis point expansion in our operating margin for the year 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net decreased 114 million compared to 2019 reflecting lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates between periods average outstanding debt was 4222 million in 2020 versus 5996 million in 2019 our 2020 average outstanding debt balance has decreased as we utilized operating cash flows to pay off debt balances our weighted average effective interest rate decreased to 21 in 2020 compared to 34 in 2019 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 189 at december 31 2020 and 177 at december 31 2019 we recorded a 286 million or 070 per diluted share benefit from asu 201609 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to a benefit of 235 million or 057 per diluted share realized in the same period in 2019 excluding the benefits from asu 201609 our effective tax rate was 252 and 251 for the years ended 2020 and 2019 respectively 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 40 to 3667 million in 2020 compared to 2616 million in 2019 adjusted net income excluding the 63 million or 015 per diluted share impact of noncash impairments net of tax increased 43 to 3730 million earnings per share increased 40 to 897 per diluted share compared to 640 per diluted share in 2019 excluding the impact of noncash impairments net of tax and the impact from asu 201609 in both periods adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 44 to 842 in 2020 compared to 583 in 2019 see the reconciliation of gaap to nongaap measures below 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

adjusted income statement information 

we have included adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps which are nongaap financial measures as supplemental disclosures because we believe these measures are useful to investors and others in assessing our yearoveryear operating performance we believe these measures should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net income and diluted eps presented in accordance with gaap respectively and in the context of our other disclosures included within this form 10q other companies may calculate these nongaap financial measures differently than we do which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures 

the table below presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income 



1 as described in our first quarter 2020 quarterly report on form 10q our effective tax rate at march 31 2020 was a 01 benefit excluding impairment from goodwill and intangibles and tax benefits from asu 201609 recorded in the first quarter of 2020 our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 254 which we used to calculate the tax impact related to the 25 million longterm note impairment

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

for discussion regarding the effects seasonality and weather have on our business see item 1 “business” of this form 10k 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2020 and 2019 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  



weather impacts on fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2019 comparisons 

in the first quarter of 2020 sales benefited from aboveaverage temperatures throughout the contiguous united states particularly in the southern united states these favorable weather conditions contrast from the first quarter of 2019 when wetter and coolerthannormal temperatures to begin the year hindered sales growth 

weather conditions in the second quarter of 2020 were varied across the contiguous united states however results in the second quarter of 2020 benefited from generally mild weather conditions much of the western united states benefited from warmer weather while the southeastern united states experienced slightly belowaverage temperatures southern california and the southeastern united states including florida experienced more precipitation than normal in contrast results for the second quarter of 2019 were largely impacted by record rainfall and cooler temperatures in three of our largest markets california texas and arizona particularly in the month of may which was the second wettest may on record for the contiguous united states 

overall weather conditions in the third quarter of 2020 were generally favorable which benefited results much of the western united states experienced aboveaverage temperatures particularly in california which was also plagued with the most active wildfire year on record precipitation was belowaverage in most of the western half of the united states and normal to aboveaverage in the eastern half likewise results in the third quarter of 2019 were positively impacted by aboveaverage temperatures and belowaverage precipitation throughout most of the country 

sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 benefited from aboveaverage temperatures and belowaverage precipitation particularly in the month of november which was the fourth warmest on record in a 126year period for the contiguous united states similarly in the fourth quarter of 2019 sales benefited from above average temperatures primarily in the southern and southeastern united states

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

• cash flows generated from operating activities 

• the adequacy of available bank lines of credit 

• the quality of our receivables 

• acquisitions 

• dividend payments 

• capital expenditures 

• changes in income tax laws and regulations 

• the timing and extent of share repurchases and 

• the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations debt repayment obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions opening new sales centers dividend payments and share repurchases our primary working capital obligations are for the purchase of inventory payroll rent other facility costs and selling and administrative expenses our working capital obligations fluctuate during the year driven primarily by seasonality and the timing of inventory purchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent capital structure including a modest amount of debt and returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

• capital expenditures primarily for maintenance and growth of our sales center structure technologyrelated investments and fleet vehicles 

• strategic acquisitions executed opportunistically 

• payment of cash dividends as and when declared by our board of directors board 

• repayment of debt to maintain an average total leverage ratio as defined below between 15 and 20 and 

• repurchases of our common stock under our board authorized share repurchase program 

capital expenditures were 06 of net sales in 2020 10 of net sales in 2019 and 11 of net sales in 2018 capital expenditures in 2020 were lower than our historical average due to costsaving measures implemented at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic over the last five years capital expenditures have averaged roughly 10 of net sales 

our capital spending primarily relates to leasehold improvements delivery and service vehicles and information technology we focus our capital expenditure plans on the needs of our sales centers for 2021 based on management’s current plans we project capital expenditures will continue to approximate the historical average 

as of december 31 2020 our average total leverage ratio was 086 which was below our target range of between 15 and 20 and below our average total leverage ratio of 161 as of december 31 2019 our strong operating results and cash flow from operations enabled us to reduce our debt balances in 2020 we expect our average total leverage ratio through the first half of 2021 will continue to be below our target range 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 19 2021 1720 million of the current board authorized amount under our authorized share repurchase plan remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations of 3976 million for 2020 increased 988 million compared to 2019 primarily reflecting the 1052 million improvement in net income 

cash used in investing activities increased in 2020 due to an increase of 1157 million in payments for acquisitions compared to 2019 which was partially offset by an 117 million decrease in net capital expenditures between years 

cash used in financing activities was 2444 million in 2020 consistent with 2445 million in 2019 which primarily reflects a 596 million decrease in net debt payments offset by additional share repurchases of 530 million and an increase in dividends paid of 82 million 

for a discussion of our sources and uses of cash in 2018 see the liquidity and capital resources – sources and uses of cash section of management’s discussion and analysis included in part ii item 7 of our 2019 annual report on form 10k 

future sources and uses of cash 

to supplement cash from operations as our primary source of working capital we will continue to utilize our three major credit facilities which are the amended and restated revolving credit facility the credit facility the term facility the term facility and the receivables securitization facility the receivables facility for additional details regarding these facilities see note 5 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

revolving credit facility 

our credit facility provides for 7500 million in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 8250 million the credit facility matures on september 29 2022 we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2020 there was 1090 million outstanding a 48 million standby letter of credit outstanding and 6362 million available for borrowing under the credit facility the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2020 was approximately 12 excluding commitment fees 

term facility 

our term facility provides for 1850 million in borrowing capacity and matures on december 30 2026 proceeds from the term facility were used to pay down the credit facility adding capacity for future share repurchases acquisitions and growthoriented working capital expansion the term facility is repaid in quarterly installments of 1250 of the term facility on the last business day of each quarter beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we classify the entire outstanding balance as longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets as we intend and have the ability to refinance the obligations on a longterm basis the total of the quarterly payments will be equal to 3375 of the term facility with the final principal repayment equal to 6625 of the term facility due on the maturity date we may prepay amounts outstanding under the term facility without penalty other than interest breakage costs 

at december 31 2020 the term facility had an outstanding balance of 1758 million at a weighted average effective interest rate of 27 

financial covenants 

financial covenants of the credit facility and the term facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2020 the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

• maximum average total leverage ratio  on the last day of each fiscal quarter our average total leverage ratio must be less than 325 to 100 average total leverage ratio is the ratio of the trailing twelve months ttm average total funded indebtedness plus the ttm average accounts securitization proceeds divided by the ttm ebitda as those terms are defined in the credit facility as of december 31 2020 our average total leverage ratio equaled 086 compared to 161 as of december 31 2019 and the ttm average total debt amount used in this calculation was 4393 million 

• minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  on the last day of each fiscal quarter our fixed charge ratio must be greater than or equal to 225 to 100 fixed charge ratio is the ratio of the ttm ebitdar divided by ttm interest expense paid or payable in cash plus ttm rental expense as those terms are defined in the credit facility as of december 31 2020 our fixed charge ratio equaled 781 compared to 538 as of december 31 2019 and ttm rental expense was 632 million 

the credit facility and the term facility also limit the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility and the term facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends additionally we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50 limit described above so long as i the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50 limit and ii our average total leverage ratio is less than 300 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice 

under the credit facility and the term facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility and the term facility could result in higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

receivables securitization facility 

our twoyear accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility offers us a lowercost form of financing with a peak funding capacity of up to 2950 million between may 1 and may 31 which includes an additional seasonal funding capacity that is available between march 1 and july 31 other funding capacities range from 1200 million to 2750 million throughout the remaining months of the year the receivables facility matures on november 1 2021 we classify the entire outstanding balance as longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets as we intend and have the ability to refinance the obligations on a longterm basis 

the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a whollyowned subsidiary the securitization subsidiary the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain thirdparty financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds limited to the applicable funding capacities upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due 

the receivables facility contains terms and conditions including representations covenants and conditions precedent customary for transactions of this type additionally an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio average total funded debtebitda of 325 to 100 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio ebitdarcash interest expense plus rental expense of 225 to 100 

at december 31 2020 there was 1200 million outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 09 excluding commitment fees 

interest rate swaps 

we utilize interest rate swap contracts and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on our variable rate borrowings interest expense related to the notional amounts under all swap contracts is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the respective borrowings 

in 2020 we had one interest rate swap in place which became effective on november 20 2019 and terminated on november 20 2020 this swap contract was previously forwardlooking and converted the variable interest rate on our variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate of 11425 on a notional amount of 1500 million 

as of december 31 2020 we had two interest rate swap contracts in place which became effective on november 20 2020 and terminate on september 29 2022 these swap contracts were previously forwardstarting and convert the variable interest rates on our variable rate borrowings to fixed interest rates of 20925 and 15500 respectively on notional amounts of 750 million each 

we have entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts to extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our variable rate borrowings these swap contracts will convert the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate on our variable rate borrowings 

the following table provides details related to each of our forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts 



compliance and future availability 

as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements under our credit facility our term facility and our receivables facility we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2021 for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2020 our contractual obligations for longterm debt operating leases and purchase obligations were as follows in thousands 



1 purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases and software commitments we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancellable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above 

the table below contains estimated interest payments in thousands related to our longterm debt obligations presented in the table above we calculated estimates of future interest payments based on the december 31 2020 outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2020 for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swap contracts to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility the term facility and the receivables facility for certain of our contractual obligations such as unrecognized tax benefits uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time as such we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table see notes 5 and 7 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for additional discussion related to our debt and more information related to our unrecognized tax benefits 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2020 there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts the portions of our outstanding balances under the credit facility term facility and the receivables facility that were not covered by our interest rate swap contracts were subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2020 related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under the credit facility excluding the accordion feature and the offseason maximum amount available under the receivables facility our term facility entered into on december 30 2019 was fully drawn as of that date in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility and the receivables facility increased by 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 78 million and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 014 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2020 the maximum amount available under the credit facility is  7500 million excluding the  750 million accordion feature and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility is 2550 million excluding the 400 million seasonal increase in capacity available from march 1 to july 31 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

changes in the exchange rates for the functional currencies of our international subsidiaries as shown in the table below may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 9 of total net sales in 2020 our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2021 and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states our vision is to become the best worldwide distributor of outdoor living products that enhance the quality of outdoor home life the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2019 we operated 373 sales centers in north america europe and australia through our four distribution networks 

• scp distributors scp 

• superior pool products superior 

• horizon distributors horizon and 

• national pool tile npt 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools technological advancements and the development of energyefficient and more aesthetically attractive products additionally the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

• longterm growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern united states where use of the outdoor home environment is more prevalent and extends longer throughout the year 

• increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment 

• consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products with new irrigation systems landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels and 

• consumers using more automation and control products higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time 

almost 60 of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenancerelated goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted consumer discretionary spending including pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2018 pk data inc reports 

the replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25 of consumer spending in the pool industry the activity in this market which includes major swimming pool remodeling is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors including home values singlefamily home sales and consumer confidence that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises just over 15 of consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize similar longterm growth rates irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new singlefamily home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables that drive new home sales however the landscape industry offers similar maintenancerelated growth opportunities as the swimming pool industry product offerings such as chemicals and fertilizers power equipment and related repair and maintenance services offer recurring revenue streams in an industry otherwise closely tied to the housing market the irrigation and landscape distribution business serves both residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market irrigation accounts for approximately 35  40 of total spending in the industry with the remaining 60  65 of spending related to landscape maintenance products power equipment hardscapes and specialty outdoor products and accessories 

our npt network primarily serves the swimming pool market but does provide some overlap with the irrigation and landscape industries as we offer our marketleading brand of pool tile composite pool finish products and hardscapes as more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand while leveraging our existing pool and irrigation and landscape customer base we feel the development of our npt network is a natural extension of our distribution model in addition to our 17 standalone npt sales centers we currently have over 100 scp and superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where landscape and swimming pool contractors as well as homeowners can view and select pool components including pool tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades and serve as stocking locations for our npt branded products we also offer virtual tools for homeowners to shop select and design their pool and outdoor environments working with their chosen contractors to install these products we believe our showrooms local stocking of products and virtual support provide us with a competitive advantage in these categories given the more discretionary nature of these products this business is more sensitive to external market factors compared to our business overall 

economic environment 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments equipment replacement landscaping projects and outdoor living space renovations 

we believe that over the long term singlefamily housing turnover and home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and employment levels contractor labor availability has also become an issue in recent years limiting our customers’ ability to fully meet consumer construction and renovation demand 

the postrecession market environment from 2010 to 2019 has been characterized by steady economic expansion the cautious recovery of consumer spending modest housing recovery and low inflation however in terms of homeowners investing in their existing homes discretionary expenditures including backyard renovations have flourished over this time period with steady increases in home values and lack of affordable new homes prompting homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments including their backyard while we estimate that new pool construction increased to approximately 80000 new units in 2019 construction levels are still down approximately 65 compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 50 from what we consider normal levels an average of approximately 170000 new units per year were built in the years leading up to the recession we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate greater growth over the next several years 

times of strong economic conditions in the united states enable further replacement remodeling and new construction activity although some constraints exist around residential construction activities economic trends indicate that consumer spending has largely recovered and we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry additionally recent regulation passed by the us department of energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps for swimming pools must be variable speed by july 2021 this mandate coupled with additional product developments and technological advancements offers further growth opportunities over the next few years 

considering the factors discussed above we believe we will realize annual sales growth rates of approximately 6 to 8 over the next five years 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers creating exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our core strategies are as follows 

• to promote the growth of our industry 

• to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and 

• to continuously strive to operate more effectively 

we promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include digital and media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® and wwwhottubscom ® and other digital marketing initiatives we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design product merchandising business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes in addition to these programs we feature consumer showrooms in over 100 of our sales centers and host our annual retail summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry we also act as a daytoday resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations we strive to create capacity with business to business development tools and execution to ensure bestinclass service and value creation for our customers and suppliers in particular we have developed the pool360 and horizon 247 platforms that help our customers be more productive by allowing them to get pricing check availability enter orders and make payments online while leveraging our customer service staff resources particularly during peak business periods these tools not only offer realtime integration into our enterprise resource planning system creating efficiencies in our business processes as well but they also provide our customers graphical catalog presentation in the same platform we are also actively making improvements to our sales centers and warehouses including improved showroom layouts sales center merchandising and velocity slotting velocity slotting uses technology to identify fast moving high velocity items which are then colorcoded and placed in an easily accessible location to create efficiencies for both our employees and customers in addition to these initiatives we strive to expand our pool corporationbranded products and exclusive brand offerings and to continue to emphasize an employer of choice culture 

we have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers depending on our market presence and capacity for additional information regarding our new sales center openings acquisitions and closuresconsolidations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in this form 10k 

we plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past 10 years although we experienced inflation above our historical average in 2019 we generally pass industry price increases through our supply chain and may make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in order to obtain favorable pricing we estimate that annual price inflation between 2017 and 2018 was consistent with the tenyear average in 2018 several manufacturers announced and implemented a midseason price increase to offset raw material transportation and labor inflation which resulted in price inflation that was approximately 2 above the historical range as we sold through the products in 2019 we anticipate a return to the historical average in 2020 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 120000 customers no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales in 2019 most of our customers are small familyowned businesses with relatively limited capital resources most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors and specialty retailers employing no more than ten employees in many cases working alone or with a limited crew these customers also buy from other distributors mass merchants home stores and certain specialty and internet retailers 

we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers for sales under early buy programs the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  allowance for doubtful accounts” for additional information

we conduct our operations through 373 sales centers in north america europe and australia our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california texas florida and arizona collectively representing approximately 52 of our 2019 net sales in 2019 we generated approximately 94 of our sales in north america including canada and mexico 5 in europe and 1 in australia while we continue to expand both domestically and internationally we expect this geographic mix to be similar over the next few years references to product line and product category data throughout this form 10k generally reflect data related to the north american swimming pool market as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations 

we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 200000 manufacturer and pool corporationbranded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and related products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry we sell the following types of products 

  

• maintenance products such as chemicals supplies and pool accessories 

• repair and replacement parts for pool equipment such as cleaners filters heaters pumps and lights 

• fiberglass pools and spas and packaged pool kits including walls liners braces and coping for inground and aboveground pools 

• pool equipment and components for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools 

• irrigation and related products including irrigation system components and professional lawn care equipment and supplies 

• building materials such as concrete plumbing and electrical components both functional and decorative pool surfaces decking materials tile hardscapes and natural stone used for pool installations and remodeling 

• commercial products including american society of material engineers asme heaters safety equipment and commercial pumps and filters and 

• other pool construction and recreational products which consist of a number of product categories and include discretionary recreational and related outdoor living products such as spas grills and components for outdoor kitchens that enhance consumers’ use and enjoyment of outdoor living spaces 

we currently have over 600 product lines and approximately 50 product categories based on our 2019 product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category represented approximately 12 of total net sales for 2019 2018 and 2017 no other product categories accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets we then evaluate the performance in these markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

recent regulation passed by the us department of energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps sold for swimming pools must be variable speed by july 2021 we expect to see minimal impact from this change until midway through the 2021 season new product technology provides opportunities not only for improved energy efficiency but also new enticements for leisure activities smart controls provide growth opportunities as most existing swimming pools run on mechanical time clocks major equipment manufacturers have developed and will continue to develop more retrofit kits that allow homeowners to interact with their pools or hot tubs through their smartphones robotic cleaners offer consumers a more efficient option for maintaining their swimming pools we see each of these developments as significant growth opportunities 

we offer a growing selection of energy efficient and environmentally preferred products which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy water and money our green technology products include variable speed pumps led pool and spa lights and highefficiency heat pumps we are committed to sustainable business practices which includes products that we offer to our customers our sourcing activities our employment practices and our involvement within the communities in which we do business we believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers shareholders employees suppliers and communities 

over the last several years we have increased our product offerings and service abilities related to commercial swimming pools we consider the commercial market to be a key growth opportunity as we focus more attention on providing products to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities while we are leveraging our existing networks and relationships to grow this market in 2017 we also acquired lincoln equipment inc a national distributor of equipment and supplies to commercial and institutional swimming pool customers 

in 2019 the sale of maintenance and minor repair products nondiscretionary accounted for almost 60 of our sales and gross profits while just over 40 of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools partially discretionary during the economic downturn which spanned from late 2006 to early 2010 and reached its low point in 2009 sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction and deferred remodeling and replacement activity the current trend reflects a partial shift back toward a greater percentage of our sales coming from major refurbishment and replacement products due to the recovery of these activities since levels reached their historic low point in 2009 

post2009 we experienced product and customer mix changes including a shift in consumer spending to some higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps and high efficiency heaters these products positively contribute to our sales and gross profit growth but negatively impact our gross margin we expect continued demand for these products but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives including growth in our higher margin private label and exclusive products plex and our expansion of building materials product offerings have helped offset these gross margin declines and will lead to somewhat flat gross margin trends over the next few years 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool market primarily to offer our customers a choice of distinctive product selections locations and service personnel 

we distribute irrigation and related products through our horizon network and tile decking materials and interior pool finish products through our npt network as well as through scp and superior networks we evaluate our sales centers based on their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs human resources support information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or thirdparty carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions for additional information regarding our inventory management see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  inventory obsolescence” of this form 10k 

we also operate four centralized shipping locations csls in the united states that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and landscape products and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool corporation which are referred to as early buy purchases these early buy purchases typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors offering the best overall terms and service to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  vendor programs” for additional information 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair plc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20 9 and 8 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2019 

competition 

we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products based on industry knowledge and available data and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies we also face competition both directly and indirectly from mass market retailers both storebased and internet and large pool supply retailers who primarily buy directly from manufacturers 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of california texas florida and arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply distribution are 

• the breadth and availability of products offered 

• the quality and level of customer service including ease of ordering and product delivery 

• the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs 

• consistency and stability of business relationships with customers and suppliers 

• competitive product pricing and 

• geographic proximity to the customer 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of swimming pool use pool and irrigation installation and remodeling and repair activities sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters in 2019 we generated approximately 63 of our net sales and 81 of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the late spring and summer primarily because extended terms offered by our suppliers are typically payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 



for discussion regarding the effects seasonality and weather had on our results of operations in 2019 and 2018 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 4500 people at december 31 2019 given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200 to 500 employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property 

we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks and patents primarily for our pool corporation and pool systems pty ltd psl branded products that are important to our current and future business operations we also own rights to numerous internet domain names

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of earnings and other financial performance measures statements of management’s expectations regarding our plans and objectives and industry general economic and other forecasts of trends future dividend payments share repurchases and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” “may” “can” “plan” “target” “potential” “should” and other words and expressions of similar meaning 

no assurance can be given that the expected results in any forwardlooking statement will be achieved and actual results may differ materially due to one or more factors for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statement include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation landscape and related outdoor living products may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

consumer discretionary spending affects our sales and is impacted by factors outside of our control including general economic conditions the residential housing market unemployment rates and wage levels interest rate fluctuations inflation disposable income levels consumer confidence and access to credit in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation landscape and related outdoor living products may decline often corresponding with declines in discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction maintenance and repair products and certain replacement and refurbishment products are required to maintain existing swimming pools and each currently account for approximately 60 and 25 of net sales related to our swimming pool business however the growth in this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbishment activity even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pools irrigation systems and outdoor living products between late 2006 and early 2010 the unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems although we have seen improvement since 2010 tightening consumer credit could prevent consumers from obtaining financing for pool irrigation and related outdoor projects which could negatively impact our sales of constructionrelated products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

given the nature of our business weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business and the effect of seasonality has a significant impact on our results in 2019 we generated approximately 63 of our net sales and 81 of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of swimming pool use pool and irrigation installation and remodeling and repair activities unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can have an adverse impact on demand due to decreased swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as decreased irrigation installations while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions such restrictions could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations which could negatively impact our sales 

certain extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms may impact our ability to deliver our services or cause damage to our facilities as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events we may experience interruption to our operations increased costs or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however any failure to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair plc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20 9 and 8 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2019 a decision by our largest suppliers acting individually or in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally if our suppliers experience difficulties or disruptions in their operations or if we lose a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers we may experience increased supply costs or may experience delays in establishing replacement supply sources that meet our quality and control standards 

we depend on a global network of suppliers to source our products including our own branded products and products we have exclusive distribution rights to product quality warranty claims or safety concerns could negatively impact our sales and expose us to litigation 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation and pool systems pty ltd branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our business if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks as well as governmental enforcement actions actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including healthrelated concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

within our industry we directly compete against various regional and local distributors as they compete against our customers for the business of pool owners and other enduse customers we indirectly compete against mass market retailers and large pool or irrigation supply retailers as they purchase the great majority of their needs directly from manufacturers and to a lesser extent with internet retailers as they purchase the majority of their needs from distributors outside of our industry we compete indirectly with alternative suppliers of big ticket consumer discretionary products such as boat and motor home distributors and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry which has led to highly competitive markets consisting of varioussized entities ranging from small or local operators to large regional businesses given the density and demand for pool products some geographic markets that we serve also tend to have a higher concentration of competitors than others particularly california texas florida and arizona these states encompass our four largest markets and represented approximately 52 of our net sales in 2019 

more aggressive competition by store and internetbased mass merchants and large pool or irrigation supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and irrigation related products has remained relatively constant should store‑ and internetbased mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or irrigation industries or increase the breadth of their pool and irrigation and related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or irrigation supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel this includes succession planning related to our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through organic market share gains new sales center openings and acquisitions that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution our various business strategies and initiatives including our growth initiatives are subject to business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control while we contemplate continued growth through internal expansion and acquisitions no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

• penetrate new markets 

• generate sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and general operating activities 

• obtain financing 

• identify appropriate acquisition candidates and successfully integrate acquired businesses 

• maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships and 

• identify and divest assets which do not continue to create value consistent with our objectives 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with employment environmental health transportation safety and other governmental regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state local and international employment environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

management has processes in place to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements however failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in investigations the assessment of administrative civil and criminal fines damages seizures disgorgements penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to regulatory matters in amounts that may be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 

the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulations is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemicals increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase our attempts to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and our plans to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance may not be as effective as we anticipate 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustibles and oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our ability to successfully conduct operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations which accounted for 9 of our total net sales in 2019 expose us to certain additional risks including 

• difficulty in staffing international subsidiary operations 

• different political economic and regulatory conditions 

• local laws and customs 

• currency fluctuations 

• adverse tax consequences and 

• dependence on other economies 

for foreignsourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

changes in tax laws and accounting standards related to tax matters have caused and may in the future cause fluctuations in our effective tax rate 

taxation and tax policy changes tax rate changes new tax laws revised tax law interpretations and changes in accounting standards and guidance related to tax matters may cause fluctuations in our effective tax rate our effective tax rate may also be impacted by changes in the geographic mix of our earnings 

in the first quarter of 2017 we adopted accounting standards update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  on a prospective basis our projections of financial statement impacts related to asu 201609 are subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options excess tax benefits or deficiencies recognized under asu 201609 vary from quarter to quarter and past results may not be indicative of future results 

we rely on information technology systems to support our business operations a significant disturbance or breach of our technological infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally failure to maintain the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

information technology supports several aspects of our business including among others product sourcing pricing customer service transaction processing financial reporting collections and cost management our ability to operate effectively on a daytoday basis and accurately report our results depends on a solid technological infrastructure which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats we are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunication failures internet failures security breaches and other catastrophic events exposure to various types of cyberattacks such as malware computer viruses worms or other malicious acts as well as human error could also potentially disrupt our operations or result in a significant interruption in the delivery of our goods and services 

advances in computer and software capabilities encryption technology and other discoveries increase the complexity of our technological environment including how each interact with our various software platforms such advances could delay or hinder our ability to process transactions or could compromise the integrity of our data resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations we also may experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our information systems unavailable or slow to respond including the interaction of our information systems with those of third parties a lack of sophistication or reliability of our information systems could adversely impact our operations and customer service and could require major repairs or replacements resulting in significant costs and foregone revenue 

our numerous procedures and protocols designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks including processes to timely notify appropriate personnel for assessment and resolution and companywide training programs our investments in information technology security and our updates to our business continuity plan may not prevent or effectively mitigate adverse consequences from cybersecurity risks the failure to maintain security over and prevent unauthorized access to our data our customers’ personal information including credit card information or data belonging to our suppliers could put us at a competitive disadvantage such a breach could result in damage to our reputation and subject us to potential litigation liability fines and penalties resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined 

borrowings under our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility term facility accounts receivable securitization facility and our derivatives instruments are indexed to the london interbank offering rate “libor” in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the regulatory authority over libor stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate although the full impact of the transition away from libor including the discontinuance of libor publication and the adoption of a replacement rate for libor remains unclear these changes may have an adverse impact on our financing costs and any floating rate indebtedness we may incur 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporation corporate offices which consist of approximately 60000 square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50  ownership interest we own five sales center facilities in florida two in texas one in alabama one in california one in georgia and one in tennessee we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three to seven year terms as of december 31 2019 we had nine leases with remaining terms longer than seven years that expire between 2027 and 2032 

most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000 square feet to 60000 square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls range in size from approximately 103000 square feet to 185000 square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during the year ended december 31 2019 



1 consolidated sales centers are those locations where we expect to transfer the majority of the existing business to our nearby sales center locations

the table below identifies the number of sales centers in each state territory or country by distribution network as of december 31 2019 






 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including product liability personal injury commercial contract and employment matters while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable based on currently available facts we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

2019 financial overview 

financial results 

we achieved favorable results in 2019 despite inclement weather throughout much of the first half of the year our focus on market share gains and capacity creation allowed us to capitalize on our competitive advantages and deliver solid results 

net sales increased 7 to a record high of 32 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 30 billion in 2018 base business sales increased 5 driven by our continued expansion in commercial and building material products as well as healthy demand for discretionary products such as construction materials and products used in the remodel and replacement of inground pools 

gross profit reached a record 9249 million for the year ended december 31 2019 a 6 increase over gross profit of 8702 million in 2018 gross margin was relatively flat yearoveryear at 289 in 2019 compared to 290 in 2018 with base business gross margin at 290 in both years 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses increased 5 to 5837 million in 2019 up from 5563 million in 2018 with base business operating expenses up 3 over 2018 the increase in base business operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher growthdriven labor and freight expenses as well as greater facilityrelated costs 

operating income for the year increased 9 to 3412 million up from 3139 million in 2018 operating margin increased to 107 in 2019 compared to 105 in 2018 while base business operating margin improved 40 basis points to 109 in 2019 

we recorded a 235 million or 057 per diluted share benefit from accounting standards update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to a benefit of 153 million or 036 per diluted share realized in 2018 

net income increased 12 to a record 2616 million in 2019 compared to 2345 million in 2018 earnings per share increased 14 to a record 640 per diluted share compared to 562 per diluted share in 2018 excluding the impact from asu 201609 in both periods earnings per diluted share increased 11 to 583 in 2019 compared to 526 in 2018 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations was 2988 million in 2019 which helped fund the following initiatives 

• quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders totaling 838 million for the year 

• net capital expenditures of 334 million 

• share repurchases totaling 232 million for the year 

• growth in net working capital of 142 million and 

• payments of 89 million for acquisitions 

total net receivables including pledged receivables increased 9 compared to december 31 2018 reflective of december sales growth our allowance for doubtful accounts was 55 million at december 31 2019 and 62 million at december 31 2018 our days sales outstanding ratio as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis was 290 days at december 31 2019 and 301 days at december 31 2018 

inventory levels grew 4 to 7023 million at december 31 2019 compared to 6726 million at december 31 2018 reflecting normal business growth and inventory from acquired businesses of 103 million our reserve for inventory obsolescence was 90 million at december 31 2019 compared to 77 million at december 31 2018 our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis were 32 times at both december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 

total debt outstanding of 5114 million at december 31 2019 decreased 1554 million or 23 compared to december 31 2018 

current trends and outlook 

market conditions were generally favorable in 2019 tempered by unfavorable weather which weighed on our results in the first half of 2019 we expect similar favorable market conditions to persist into 2020 and beyond buoyed by a number of factors 

the postrecession market environment from 2010 to 2019 has been characterized by steady economic expansion the cautious recovery of consumer spending modest housing recovery and low inflation however in terms of homeowners investing in their existing homes discretionary expenditures including backyard renovations have flourished over this time period with steady increases in home values and lack of affordable new homes prompting homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments including their backyard we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally constrained by availability of construction labor but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate continued growth over the next several years 

although some constraints exist around residential construction activities we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent long term growth opportunities in our industry additionally recent regulation passed by the us department of energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps for swimming pools must be variable speed by july 2021 this mandate coupled with additional product developments and technological advancements offers further growth opportunities over the next few years 

while we estimate that new pool construction was approximately 80000 new units in 2019 construction levels are still down approximately 65 compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 50 from what we consider normal levels favorable weather plays a role in industry growth by accelerating growth in any given year expanding the number of available construction days extending the pool season and pool usage and positively impacting demand for discretionary products conversely unfavorable weather impedes growth wetter and coolerthannormal temperatures throughout the first half of 2019 delayed pool openings and led to lower construction and remodeling activity although the latter half of the year benefited from relatively normalized weather patterns in establishing our outlook each year we base our growth assumptions on normal weather conditions and do not incorporate alternative weather predictions into our guidance 

we established our initial outlook for 2020 based on reasonable expectations of organic market share growth ongoing leverage of existing investments in our business and continuous process improvements for 2020 we expect the macroeconomic environment in the united states will be quite similar to 2019 we expect to continue to gain market share through our comprehensive service and product offerings which we continually diversify through internal sourcing initiatives and expansion into new markets we also plan to broaden our geographic presence by opening 8 to 10 new sales centers in 2020 and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise 

the following summarizes our outlook for 2020 

• we expect sales growth of 6 to 8 impacted by the following factors and assumptions 

◦ normal weather patterns for 2020 which would result in greater sales growth in the first half of the year than in the second half 

◦ continued growth from replacement remodeling and construction activity and market expansion through newer product and service offerings such as hardscapes and commercial pools 

◦ inflationary product cost increases of approximately 1 to 2 and 

◦ market share gains 

• we expect relatively neutral gross margin trends for the full year with lower gross margin growth in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019 which benefited from strategic inventory purchases we made in the latter half of 2018 and modestly positive gross margin growth in the second half of the year 

• we expect operating expenses will grow at approximately 60 of the rate of our gross profit growth reflecting inflationary increases and incremental costs to support our sales growth expectations with greater growth in the first half of the year and more modest growth in the back half the main challenges in achieving this metric include managing people and facility costs in tight labor and real estate markets however we continue to see significant opportunity to leverage our existing infrastructure to achieve this goal 

in 2020 we expect our effective tax rate will approximate 255 excluding the impact of asu 201609 our effective tax rate is dependent upon our results of operations and may change if actual results are different from our current expectation due to asu 201609 requirements we expect our effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter particularly in periods when employees elect to exercise their vested stock options or when restrictions on sharebased awards lapse based on our december 31 2019 stock price we estimate that we have approximately 23 million in unrealized excess tax benefits related to stock options that expire and restricted awards that will vest in the first quarter of 2020 we may recognize additional tax benefits related to stock option exercises in 2020 from grants that expire in years after 2020 for which we have not included any expected benefits in our guidance the estimated impact related to asu 201609 is subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options we recorded a 235 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2019 related to asu 201609 

we project that 2020 earnings will be in the range of 647 to 677 per diluted share including an estimated 006 benefit from asu 201609 during the first quarter of 2020 we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2020 and we anticipate that we will use 1500 million to 2000 million in cash for share repurchases 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions changes in the economy and the housing market our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k also see “cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” prior to the heading “risk factors” in item 1a 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

• those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and 

• those for which changes in the estimates or assumptions or the use of different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

similar to our business our customers’ businesses are seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging these reserves range from 005 for amounts currently due to up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectability based on a combination of factors including 

• aging statistics and trends 

• customer payment history 

• independent credit reports and 

• discussions with customers 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 007 of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales approximated 012 in 2019 007 in 2018 and 005 in 2017 we expect that writeoffs will range from 005 to 010 of net sales in 2020 

at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend allowance for doubtful accounts balance to i current year writeoffs and ii any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2019 pretax income would change by approximately 11 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 002 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2019 

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently turn at slower rates 

we classify products into 13 classes at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the expected sellable period which is the previous 12 months for most products all inventory is included in these classes except for special order nonstock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 



there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory at net realizable value we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months’ usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

• the level of inventory in relation to historical sales by product including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the sales center level and on a companywide basis 

• changes in customer preferences or regulatory requirements 

• seasonal fluctuations in inventory levels 

• geographic location and 

• superseded products and new product offerings 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend obsolescence reserve balance to i current year inventory writeoffs and ii the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2019 pretax income would change by approximately 18 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 003 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2019 

vendor programs 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors or our net cost of products sold and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor programs as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount earned based on our expectation of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward the attainment of various levels within certain vendor programs we accrue vendor program benefits on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including changes in economic conditions and weather changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors 

we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor program benefits accrual may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase levels in the first quarter of the subsequent year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor credits received to the prior year vendor receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our vendor program estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tjca or the act enactment significantly changed us tax law the act reduced the overall corporate income tax rate to 21 created a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings broadened the tax base and allowed for the immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property due to the complexities presented by the act particularly for companies with multinational operations the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 sab 118 to provide guidance to allow companies to record provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates as a result of this guidance we recorded a provisional net benefit to our income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 as of december 31 2018 we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the act which did not result in a material adjustment to our provisional amount for the global intangible low tax income gilti provisions of the act we have elected an accounting policy to record gilti as period costs if and when incurred 

as of december 31 2019 us income taxes were not provided on the earnings or cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the provisions of the transition tax from us tax reform as we have historically invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to fund current cash flow needs in the countries where held additional income tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings and cash balances is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation we determined not to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of us tax reform  

we operate in 39 states 1 united states territory and 11 foreign countries we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities and the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

each year we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns based on this hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate differences between our effective income tax rate and federal and state statutory tax rates are primarily due to valuation allowances recorded for certain of our international subsidiaries with tax losses 

performancebased compensation accrual 

the compensation committee of our board compensation committee annually reviews our compensation structure to oversee management’s implementation of maintaining a program that attracts retains develops and motivates employees without leading to unnecessary risk taking our compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including operating income and diluted earnings per share eps 

we use an annual cash performance award annual bonus to focus corporate behavior on shortterm goals for growth financial performance and other specific financial and business improvement metrics management sets the company’s annual bonus objectives at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year management also establishes specific business improvement objectives for both our operating units and corporate employees the compensation committee approves objectives for annual bonus plans involving executive management 

we also utilize our mediumterm threeyear strategic plan incentive program spip to provide senior management with an additional cashbased payforperformance award based on the achievement of specified earnings growth objectives payouts through the spip are based on threeyear compound annual growth rates cagrs of our diluted eps 

we record annual performancebased compensation accruals based on operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives starting in june and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated performancebased compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans if any 

we record spip accruals based on our total expected eps for the current fiscal year and earnings growth estimates for the succeeding two years we base our current fiscal year estimates on the same assumptions used for our annual bonus calculation and we base our forwardlooking estimates on historical growth trends and our projections for the remainder of the threeyear performance periods 

our quarterly performancebased compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

• differences between estimated and actual performance 

• our projections related to achievement of multipleyear performance objectives for our spip and 

• the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year each year we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous years end to determine the accuracy of our performancebased compensation estimates based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our performancebased compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is our largest intangible asset at december 31 2019 our goodwill balance was 1886 million representing approximately 13 of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we perform a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units falls below its carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we perform a calculation to measure impairment which includes valuing the tangible and intangible assets we recognize any impairment loss in operating income 

since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level we define a reporting unit as an individual sales center as of october 1 2019 we had 223 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the most significant goodwill balance for a reporting unit was 57 million and the average goodwill balance was 08 million 

in october of 2019 2018 and 2017 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not recognize any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows we project future cash flows using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates operating margins discount rates and multiples these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium our aggregate estimated fair values fell in line with our market capitalization which we consider to be reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test to facilitate a sensitivity analysis we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate to reflect more conservative discounted cash flow assumptions the sensitivity of a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate our sensitivity analysis generated a fair value estimate below our market capitalization and resulted in the identification of no additional atrisk locations 

based on our 2019 goodwill impairment analysis we consider our reporting units in australia as most at risk for goodwill impairment we entered australia in july 2014 with the acquisition of a controlling interest in pool systems pty ltd psl the previous owner of psl provided executive oversight until our purchase of the noncontrolling interest in june 2017 since 2014 we have continued to expand our operations in australia via one sales center opening and the acquisitions of newline pool products in july 2017 and pool power in january 2018 the most sensitive assumptions related to our fair values for these locations relate to future projected operating results and management’s ability to effectively leverage our operating structure and manage costs as we expand our presence as of december 31 2019 our aggregate goodwill balance for our five reporting units in australia was 40 million 

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted we could incur impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting units discussed above impairment charges would decrease operating income negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for details 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2019 2018 and 2017 we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



1 we acquired certain distribution assets of each of these companies 

when calculating our base business results we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2019 



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 7 compared to 2018 with 5 of this increase resulting from base business sales growth unfavorable weather impacts throughout much of the first half of 2019 including record rainfall in may led to delayed pool openings and lower construction and remodeling activity despite some weather events in the third quarter including hurricane dorian in florida and tropical storm imelda in southeast texas above average temperatures and below average precipitation throughout most of the country benefited overall swimming pool industry growth and allowed us to serve the pentup demand from earlier in the year favorable weather conditions continued in the fourth quarter of 2019 as much of the southern and southeastern united states particularly florida experienced above average temperatures although some of our seasonal markets experienced weather challenges early in the quarter these conditions supported our 2019 sales growth and are contrasted from the fourth quarter of 2018 when most of the united states experienced cooler than normal temperatures and higher than average precipitation despite the negative impacts resulting from the inclement weather in the first half of the year with disciplined execution by our teams and improved weather conditions in the latter half of the year we produced 7 sales growth in 2019 on top of sales growth of 8 in 2018 

the following factors benefited our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

• continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures including continued growth in remodeling and replacement activity see discussion below 

• market share growth particularly in building materials and commercial product categories see discussion below 

• 4 sales growth in chemicals our largest product category at 12 of total net sales for 2019 compared to 2018 

• inflation driven estimated at approximately 2 above our historical average of 1 to 2 product selling price increases and 

• 2 sales growth from recent acquisitions 

we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings such as building materials and equipment evidence increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas including pool construction and pool remodeling as well as equipment upgrades in 2019 sales for equipment such as swimming pool heaters pumps lights and filters increased 7 compared to 2018 and collectively represented approximately 27 of net sales this increase reflects both the growth of replacement activity and continued demand for higherpriced more energyefficient products sales of building materials which includes tile grew 9 compared to 2018 and represented approximately 12 of net sales in 2019 

sales to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities are included in the appropriate existing product categories and growth in this area is reflected in the numbers above sales to these customers increased 8 in 2019 on top of sales growth of 11 in 2018 and represented approximately 5 of net sales in 2019 

2019 quarterly sales performance compared to 2018 quarterly sales performance 

• net sales increased 2 in the first quarter of 2019 while base business sales grew 1 sales in the first quarter were largely impacted by cool wet weather particularly in the western united states and by a later easter holiday than in 2018 

• favorable weather conditions in the southeastern united states led to net sales growth of 6 and base business sales growth of 4 in the second quarter of 2019 sales in the second quarter were hindered by record rainfall and cooler temperatures in three of our four largest markets california texas and arizona 

• in the third quarter of 2019 net sales increased 11 while base business sales increased 9 sales in the third quarter benefited from favorable weather conditions and strong demand throughout our industry 

• for our seasonally slowest fourth quarter both net sales and base business sales increased 7 in 2019 as weather challenges early in the quarter brought an abrupt end to business in some of our seasonal markets 

in addition to the sales discussion above see further details of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations below 

gross profit 



gross margin was relatively flat yearoveryear at 289 in 2019 compared to 290 in 2018 with base business gross margin at 290 in both years 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 5 to 5837 million in 2019 up from 5563 million in 2018 while base business operating expenses grew 3 in addition to incremental costs incurred related to recent acquisitions and sales center openings the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher growthdriven labor and freight expenses as well as greater facilityrelated costs operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 40 basis points contributing to the 20 basis point expansion in our operating margin for the year and 40 points of base business operating margin expansion 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net increased 29 million compared to 2018 the increase reflects higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates between periods average outstanding debt was 5996 million in 2019 versus 5791 million in 2018 our 2019 average outstanding debt balance reflects greater borrowings made in the first half of the year primarily to fund working capital growth although debt levels declined later in the year and finished at 77 of our 2018 balance at december 31 2019 our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 34 in 2019 compared to 33 in 2018 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 177 at december 31 2019 and 201 at december 31 2018 we recorded a 235 million benefit from asu 201609 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to a benefit of 153 million realized in the same period in 2018 excluding the benefits from asu 201609 our effective tax rate was 251 and 253 for the years ended 2019 and 2018 respectively 

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 12 to 2616 million in 2019 compared to 2345 million in 2018 earnings per share increased 14 to 640 per diluted share compared to 562 per diluted share in 2018 excluding the 057 per diluted share impact of asu 201609 in 2019 and 036 in 2018 diluted earnings per share increased 11 over last year

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2019 and 2018 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  



weather impacts on fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2018 comparisons 

wetter and cooler than normal temperatures to begin the year hindered our first quarter of 2019 sales growth much of the western united states particularly california and arizona experienced cold to record cold temperatures in january and february the latter half of march benefited from warmer weather throughout most of the country and provided some relief from the slow start earlier in the year the first quarter of 2018 experienced similar though less significant unfavorable weather in certain markets leading to more adverse conditions in 2019 compared to 2018 

results for the second quarter of 2019 were largely impacted by record rainfall and cooler temperatures in three of our largest markets california texas and arizona particularly in the month of may which was the second wettest may on record for the contiguous united states in the southeastern united states favorable weather conditions including above average temperatures delivered strong sales growth in these markets in contrast in the second quarter of 2018 results in the last two months of the quarter benefited from warm weather throughout the country and helped relieve the effects of a slow start from earlier in 2018 

above average temperatures and below average precipitation throughout most of the country in the third quarter of 2019 positively impacted results for the quarter in the contiguous united states september tied with 2015 as the second warmest on record throughout the quarter the southern united states and the ohio valley benefited from dry conditions despite some weather events including hurricane dorian in florida and tropical storm imelda in southeast texas these markets delivered favorable results in the third quarter of 2019 conversely bouts of severe weather including hurricane florence elevated rainfall in texas and wildfires in california adversely impacted results for the third quarter of 2018 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 much of the southern and southeastern united states particularly florida experienced above average temperatures which led to increased sales growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 when most of the united states experienced below average temperatures and higher than average precipitation

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

• cash flows generated from operating activities 

• the adequacy of available bank lines of credit 

• the quality of our receivables 

• acquisitions 

• dividend payments 

• capital expenditures 

• changes in income tax laws and regulations 

• the timing and extent of share repurchases and 

• the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent capital structure including a modest amount of debt and returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

• capital expenditures primarily for maintenance and growth of our sales center structure technologyrelated investments and fleet vehicles 

• strategic acquisitions executed opportunistically 

• payment of cash dividends as and when declared by our board of directors board 

• repayment of debt to maintain an average total leverage ratio as defined below between 15 and 20 and 

• repurchases of our common stock under our board authorized share repurchase program 

capital expenditures were 10 of net sales in 2019 11 of net sales in 2018 and 14 of net sales in 2017 our higher capital spending in 2017 related to expanding our facilities and purchasing delivery vehicles to address growth over the last five years capital expenditures have averaged roughly 10 of net sales 

our capital spending primarily relates to leasehold improvements delivery and service vehicles and information technology we focus our capital expenditure plans on the needs of our sales centers in 2018 we performed an evaluation of our enterprise resource planning system although we do not anticipate a complete replacement of our enterprise resource planning system we do plan to migrate our current system to a new environment over a number of years this plan requires modest incremental capital investments over that time frame rather than a significant onetime investment for 2020 based on management’s current plans we project capital expenditures will continue to approximate the historical average 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 21 2020 2492 million of the current board authorized amount under our authorized share repurchase plan remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations of 2988 million for 2019 increased 1801 million compared to 2018 the strategic inventory purchases that we made in the latter half of 2018 negatively impacted our 2018 cash flows due to timing differences that reversed in 2019 

cash used in investing activities increased in 2019 due to an increase of 63 million in payments for acquisitions compared to 2018 and a 18 million increase in net capital expenditures between years 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2019 which primarily reflects increased payments on our revolving line of credit we had 1554 million of net payments on our debt arrangements in 2019 compared to net proceeds of 1465 million in 2018 we repurchased 232 million of shares in 2019 compared to 1875 million in 2018 

for a discussion of our sources and uses of cash in 2017 see the liquidity and capital resources – sources and uses of cash section of management’s discussion and analysis included in part ii item 7 of our 2018 annual report on form 10k 

future sources and uses of cash 

to supplement cash from operations as our primary source of working capital we will continue to utilize our three major credit facilities which are the amended and restated revolving credit facility the credit facility the term facility the term facility and the receivables securitization facility the receivables facility for additional details regarding these facilities see note 5 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

revolving credit facility 

our credit facility provides for 7500 million in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 8250 million the credit facility matures on september 29 2022 we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2019 there was 2007 million outstanding a 48 million standby letter of credit outstanding and 5445 million available for borrowing under the credit facility the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2019 was approximately 28 excluding commitment fees 

term facility 

our term facility provides for 1850 million in borrowing capacity and matures on december 30 2026 the term facility will be repaid in quarterly installments of 1250 of the term facility on the last business day of each quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2020 the total of the quarterly payments will be equal to 3375 of the term facility with the final principal repayment equal to 6625 of the term facility due on the maturity date we may prepay amounts outstanding under the term facility without penalty other than interest breakage costs 

at december 31 2019 the term facility was fully drawn with an outstanding balance of 1850 million at a weighted average effective interest rate of 25 proceeds from the term facility were used to pay down the credit facility adding capacity for future share repurchases acquisitions and growthoriented working capital expansion 

financial covenants 

financial covenants of the credit facility and the term facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2019 the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

• maximum average total leverage ratio  on the last day of each fiscal quarter our average total leverage ratio must be less than 325 to 100 average total leverage ratio is the ratio of the trailing twelve months ttm average total funded indebtedness plus the ttm average accounts securitization proceeds divided by the ttm ebitda as those terms are defined in the credit facility as of december 31 2019 our average total leverage ratio equaled 161 compared to 172 as of december 31 2018 and the ttm average total debt amount used in this calculation was 6149 million 

• minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  on the last day of each fiscal quarter our fixed charge ratio must be greater than or equal to 225 to 100 fixed charge ratio is the ratio of the ttm ebitdar divided by ttm interest expense paid or payable in cash plus ttm rental expense as those terms are defined in the credit facility as of december 31 2019 our fixed charge ratio equaled 538 compared to 533 as of december 31 2018 and ttm rental expense was 602 million 

on january 1 2019 we adopted asu 201602 leases  which requires that we record most of our leases on our balance sheets our credit facility and term facility agreements require that we calculate our financial covenants by excluding the effects of the new standard the adoption of asu 201602 did not have a material impact on our financial covenant calculations for additional details regarding our adoption of this new accounting pronouncement see note 1 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

the credit facility and the term facility also limit the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility and the term facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends additionally we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50 limit described above so long as i the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50 limit and ii our average total leverage ratio is less than 300 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice 

under the credit facility and the term facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility and the term facility could result in higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

receivables securitization facility 

as amended on november 1 2019 our twoyear receivables facility offers us a lowercost form of financing with a peak funding capacity of up to 2950 million between may 1 and may 31 which includes an additional seasonal funding capacity that is available between march 1 and july 31 other funding capacities range from 1200 million to 2750 million throughout the remaining months of the year 

the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a whollyowned subsidiary the securitization subsidiary the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain thirdparty financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds limited to the applicable funding capacities upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due 

the receivables facility contains terms and conditions including representations covenants and conditions precedent customary for transactions of this type additionally an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio average total funded debtebitda of 325 to 100 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio ebitdarcash interest expense plus rental expense of 225 to 100 

at december 31 2019 there was 1150 million outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 26 excluding commitment fees 

interest rate swaps 

we utilize interest rate swap contracts and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on our variable rate borrowings 

in 2019 we had three interest rate swap contracts in place that became effective on october 19 2016 these swap contracts were previously forwardstarting and were amended in october 2015 to bring the fixed rates per our forwardstarting contracts in line with current market rates and extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility these interest rate swap contracts terminated on november 20 2019 these amended swap contracts converted variable interest rates on our variable rate borrowings to fixed rates of 2273 on a notional amount of 750 million and 2111 on two separate notional amounts one 250 million and the other 500 million totaling 750 million interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swap contracts was based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on our variable rate borrowings 

as of december 31 2019 we had one interest rate swap in place which became effective on november 20 2019 this swap contract was previously forwardlooking and converts the variable interest rate on our variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate of 11425 on a notional amount of 1500 million the contract terminates on november 20 2020 

in may and july 2019 we entered into additional forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts which will convert the variable interest rate on our variable rate borrowings to fixed interest rates of 20925 and 15500 respectively on notional amounts of 750 million each these contracts become effective on november 20 2020 and terminate on september 29 2022 

on february 5 2020 we entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap contract with a fixed interest rate of 13800 on a notional amount of 1500 million this contract becomes effective on february 26 2021 and terminates on february 28 2025 

compliance and future availability 

as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements under our credit facility our term facility and our receivables facility we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2020 for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2019 our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 



the table below contains estimated interest payments in thousands related to our longterm debt obligations presented in the table above we calculated estimates of future interest payments based on the december 31 2019 outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2019 for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swap contracts to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility the term facility and the receivables facility for certain of our contractual obligations such as unrecognized tax benefits uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time as such we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table see notes 5 and 7 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for additional discussion related to our debt and more information related to our unrecognized tax benefits 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2019 there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts the portions of our outstanding balances under the credit facility term facility and the receivables facility that were not covered by our interest rate swap contracts were subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2019 related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under the credit facility excluding the accordion feature and the offseason maximum amount available under the receivables facility our term facility entered into on december 30 2019 was fully drawn as of that date in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility and the receivables facility increased by 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 78 million and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 014 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2019 the maximum amount available under the credit facility is  7500 million excluding the  750 million accordion feature and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility is 2550 million excluding the 400 million seasonal increase in capacity available from march 1 to july 31 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

changes in the exchange rates for the functional currencies of our international subsidiaries as shown in the table below may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 9 of total net sales in 2019 our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2020 and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us  or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states our vision is to become the best worldwide distributor of outdoor living products that enhance the quality of outdoor home life the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2018  we operated 364  sales centers in north america europe south america and australia through our four distribution networks 

 

our industry 

we participate in a worldwide market for outdoor living products through our four distribution networks 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools technological advancements and the development of energyefficient and more aesthetically attractive products additionally the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

 

almost 60  of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenancerelated goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2017 pk data inc reports 

  

the replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25  of consumer spending in the pool industry the activity in this market which includes major swimming pool remodeling is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises just over 15  of consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize similar long‑term growth rates irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new single‑family home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables however the landscape industry offers similar maintenancerelated growth opportunities as the swimming pool industry product offerings such as chemicals and fertilizers power equipment and related repair and maintenance services offer recurring revenue streams in an industry otherwise closely tied to the housing market the irrigation and landscape distribution business serves both residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market irrigation accounts for approximately 50  of total spending in the industry with the remaining 50  of spending related to landscape power equipment hardscapes and specialty outdoor products and accessories 

our npt network overlaps the swimming pool and irrigation and landscape industries as we offer our marketleading brand of pool tile composite pool finish products and hardscapes as more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand while leveraging our existing pool and irrigation and landscape customer base we feel the development of our npt network is a natural extension of our distribution model in addition to our 17  standalone npt sales centers we currently have over 100 scp and superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where landscape and swimming pool contractors as well as homeowners can view and select pool components including pool tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades and serve as stocking locations for our npt branded products given the more discretionary nature of these products this business is more sensitive to external market factors compared to our business overall 

economic environment 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments equipment replacement landscaping projects and outdoor living space renovations 

we believe that over the long term singlefamily housing turnover and home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and employment 

while market conditions have been generally favorable the past year a number of factors weigh on our industry including lagging new home construction tighter lending standards and the slower progression of a younger generation burdened by student debt and underemployment labor availability and cost have also become issues in recent years limiting our customers’ ability to fully meet consumer demand particularly in construction and renovation markets 

the postrecession market environment from 2010 to 2018 was characterized by the cautious recovery of consumer spending modest housing recovery and low inflation however in terms of homeowners investing in their existing homes discretionary expenditures including backyard renovations flourished over this time period while we estimate that new pool construction increased to approximately 80000  new units in 2018  construction levels are still down approximately 65  compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 50 from what we consider normal levels an average of approximately 170000 new units per year were built in the years leading up to the recession we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate greater growth over the next five years 

times of strong economic conditions in the united states enable further replacement remodeling and new construction activity although some constraints exist around residential construction activities economic trends indicate that consumer spending has largely recovered and we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry additionally recent regulation passed by the us department of energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps for swimming pools must be variable speed by july 2021 this mandate coupled with additional product developments and technological advancements offers further growth opportunities over the next few years 

in an effort to mitigate inflation the federal reserve raised borrowing rates several times in 2018 while it appears that the rising interest rates slowed down borrowing for home buying in the short term interest rates remain low by historical standards perhaps more importantly the scarcity of land and labor limited new home construction growth and drove up home values over the last several years by mid2018 this trend appeared to have reached its peak or at least paused in many markets due to home affordability coupled with rising interest rates 

considering the factors discussed above we believe we will realize an annual sales growth rate of approximately 6 to 9  over the next five years 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers creating exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our core strategies are as follows 

 

we promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include digital and media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® and wwwhottubscom ® public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as 

customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design product merchandising business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes in addition to these programs we feature consumer showrooms in over 100 of our sales centers and host our annual retail summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry we also act as a daytoday resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations we strive to create capacity with business to business development tools and execution to ensure best in class service and value creation for our customers and suppliers in particular we have developed the pool360 and horizon 247 platforms that help our customers be more productive by allowing them to get pricing check availability enter orders and make payments on line while leveraging our customer service staff resources particularly during peak business periods these tools not only offer realtime integration into our enterprise resource planning system creating efficiencies in our business processes as well but they also provide our customers graphical catalog presentation in the same platform in addition to these initiatives we strive to emphasize an employer of choice culture and to expand our pool corporationbranded products and exclusive brand offerings 

we have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers in recent years we have focused our efforts on new sales center openings complemented by strategic acquisitions and consolidations depending on our market presence for additional information regarding our new sales center openings acquisitions and closuresconsolidations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in this form 10k 

we plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past 10 years we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and may make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases we estimate that annual price inflation between 2016  and 2018  was consistent with the tenyear average in 2018 several manufacturers announced and implemented a midseason price increase to offset raw material transportation and labor inflation unlike previous years we expect inflation in 2019 to fall outside of the historical range specifically we expect inflation to be approximately 2 above historical norms in 2019 but we anticipate a return to the historical average over the long term 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 120000  customers no single customer accounted for 10 of our sales in 2018  further in 2018  sales to our largest 100 customers collectively accounted for just over 10 of our total sales most of our customers are small familyowned businesses with relatively limited capital resources most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors and specialty retailers employing no more than ten employees in many cases working alone or with a limited crew these customers also buy from other distributors mass merchants home stores and certain specialty and internet retailers 

we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers for sales under early buy programs the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates” for additional information 

we sell our products primarily to the following types of customers 

 

we conduct our operations through 364  sales centers in north america europe south america and australia our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california texas florida and arizona collectively representing approximately 53  of our 2018  net sales in 2018  we generated approximately 94 of our sales in north america including canada and mexico 5 in europe and 1 in south america and australia combined while we continue to expand both domestically and internationally we expect this geographic mix to be similar over the next few years references to product line and product category data throughout this form 10k generally reflect data related to the north american swimming pool market as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations 

we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 180000  manufacturer and pool corporationbranded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and related products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry we sell the following types of products 

  

 

we currently have over 600  product lines and approximately 50 product categories based on our 2018  product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category represented approximately 12  of total net sales for 2018  and 2017  and 13  of our total net sales in 2016  no other product categories account for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets we then evaluate the performance in these markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

recent regulation passed by the us department of energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps for swimming pools must be variable speed by july 2021 additionally new product technology provides opportunities not only for improved energy efficiency but also new enticements for leisure activities smart controls provide growth opportunities as most existing swimming pools run on mechanical time clocks major equipment manufacturers have developed and will continue to develop more retrofit kits that allow homeowners to interact with their pools or hot tubs through their smartphones robotic cleaners offer consumers a more efficient option for maintaining their swimming pools we see each of these developments as significant growth opportunities 

over the last several years we have increased our product offerings and service abilities related to commercial swimming pools we consider the commercial market to be a key growth opportunity as we focus more attention on providing products to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities while we are leveraging our existing networks and relationships to grow this market in 2017 we also acquired lincoln equipment inc a national distributor of equipment and supplies to commercial and institutional swimming pool customers 

in 2018  the sale of maintenance and minor repair products nondiscretionary accounted for almost 60 of our sales and gross profits while just over 40 of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools partially discretionary during the economic downturn which spanned from late 2006 to early 2010 and reached its low point in 2009 sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction and deferred remodeling and replacement activity the current trend reflects a shift back toward a greater percentage of our sales coming from major refurbishment and replacement products due to the recovery of these activities since levels reached their historic low point in 2009 

post2009 we experienced product and customer mix changes including a shift in consumer spending to higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps high efficiency heaters and irrigation and related equipment these products positively contribute to our sales and gross profit growth but negatively impact our gross margin we expect continued demand for these products but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives including growth in our higher margin private label and exclusive products plex and our expansion of building materials product offerings have helped offset these gross margin declines and will lead to somewhat flat gross margin trends over the next few years 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool market primarily for two reasons 

 

we distribute irrigation and related products through our horizon network and tile decking materials and interior pool finish products through our npt network we evaluate our sales centers based on their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixed‑use zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or thirdparty carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions for additional information regarding our inventory management see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  inventory obsolescence” of this form 10k 

we also operate four  centralized shipping locations csls that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and landscape products and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool corporation which are referred to as early buy purchases these early buy purchases typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors offering the best overall terms and service to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20  9  and 8  respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2018  

competition 

we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products based on industry knowledge and available data and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies we also face competition both directly and indirectly from mass market retailers both storebased and internet and large pool supply retailers who primarily buy directly from manufacturers 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of california texas florida and arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply distribution are 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and irrigation and landscaping installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2018  we generated approximately 62  of our net sales and 81  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 



for discussion regarding the effects seasonality and weather had on our results of operations in 2018  and 2017  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 4000  people at december 31 2018  given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200  to 500  employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property 

we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks and patents primarily for our pool corporation and pool systems pty ltd psl branded products that are important to our current and future business operations we also own rights to numerous internet domain names

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forward‑looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of earnings and other financial performance measures statements of management’s expectations regarding our plans and objectives and industry general economic and other forecasts of trends future dividend payments and other matters forward‑looking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” “may” “can” “plan” “target” “potential” “should” and other words and expressions of similar meaning 

no assurance can be given that the expected results in any forwardlooking statement will be achieved and actual results may differ materially due to one or more factors for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward‑looking statement include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation landscape and related outdoor living products may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

consumer discretionary spending affects our sales and is impacted by factors outside of our control including general economic conditions disposable income levels consumer confidence and access to credit in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation landscape and related outdoor living products may decline often corresponding with declines in discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction maintenance and repair products and certain replacement and refurbishment products are required to maintain existing swimming pools and each currently account for approximately 60  and 25  of net sales related to our swimming pool business however the growth in this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbishment activity even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pools irrigation systems and outdoor living products between late 2006 and early 2010 the unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems although we have seen improvement since 2010 tightening consumer credit could prevent consumers from obtaining financing for pool irrigation and related outdoor projects which could negatively impact our sales of constructionrelated products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as irrigation installations and landscape maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions such restrictions could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations which could negatively impact our sales for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however any failure to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20  9  and 8  respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2018  a decision by our largest suppliers acting individually or in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally if our suppliers experience difficulties or disruptions in their operations or if we lose a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers we may experience increased supply costs or may experience delays in establishing replacement supply sources that meet our quality and control standards 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

within our industry we directly compete against various regional and local distributors as they compete against our customers for the business of pool owners and other enduse customers we indirectly compete against mass market retailers and large pool or irrigation supply retailers as they purchase the great majority of their needs directly from manufacturers and to a lesser extent with internet retailers as they purchase the majority of their needs from distributors outside of our industry we compete indirectly with alternative suppliers of big ticket consumer discretionary products such as boat and motor home distributors and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry which has led to highly competitive markets consisting of varioussized entities ranging from small or local operators to large regional businesses given the density and demand for pool products some geographic markets that we serve also tend to have a higher concentration of competitors than others particularly california texas florida and arizona these states encompass our four largest markets and represented approximately 53  of our net sales in 2018  

more aggressive competition by store and internetbased mass merchants and large pool or irrigation supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and irrigation related products has remained relatively constant should store‑ and internetbased mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or irrigation industries or increase the breadth of their pool and irrigation and related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or irrigation supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel this includes succession planning related to our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through organic market share gains new sales center openings and acquisitions that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution our various business strategies and initiatives including our growth initiatives are subject to business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control while we contemplate continued growth through internal expansion and acquisitions no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal 

the demand for our services and our results of operations are affected by the seasonal nature of our business in 2018  we generated approximately 62  of our net sales and 81  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of both swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and irrigation installations and maintenance our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation the demand for our products and services and our market share 

the success or our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences expectations and needs while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand 

customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding customers routinely use technology to rapidly compare products and prices determine realtime product availability and purchase products once products are purchased customers are seeking alternate options for lowercost delivery of those products we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with employment environmental health transportation safety and other governmental regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state local and international employment environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

management has processes in place to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements however failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in investigations the assessment of administrative civil and criminal fines damages seizures disgorgements penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to regulatory matters in amounts that may be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 

the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulations is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemicals increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustibles and oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our ability to successfully conduct operations in and source products and materials from international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our us operations as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our international operations which accounted for 9  of our total net sales in 2018  expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

for foreignsourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products and there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

changes in tax laws and accounting standards related to tax matters have caused and may in the future cause fluctuations in our effective tax rate 

taxation and tax policy changes tax rate changes new tax laws revised tax law interpretations and changes in accounting standards and guidance related to tax matters may cause fluctuations in our effective tax rate the tax cuts and jobs act tjca or the act enacted in december 2017 significantly changed us tax law our income tax provision is based on our current interpretation of this legislation and on reasonable estimates and may change as a result of new guidance issued by regulators our effective tax rate may also be impacted by changes in the geographic mix of our earnings 

in the first quarter of 2017 we adopted accounting standards update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  on a prospective basis our projections of financial statement impacts related to asu 201609 are subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options excess tax benefits or deficiencies recognized under asu 201609 vary from quarter to quarter and past results may not be indicative of future results 

we depend on a global network of suppliers to source our products product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our sales and expose us to legal claims 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell and distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation and pool systems pty ltd branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our business if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks as well as governmental enforcement actions the risk of claims may also be greater with respect to products manufactured by thirdparty suppliers outside the united states particularly in china uncertainties with respect to foreign legal systems may adversely affect us in resolving claims arising from our foreign sourced products even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and our company 

we rely on information technology systems to support our business operations any disturbance or breach of our technological infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally failure to maintain the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

information technology supports several aspects of our business   including among others product sourcing pricing customer service transaction processing financial reporting collections and cost management our ability to operate effectively on a day‑to‑day basis and accurately report our results depends on a solid technological infrastructure which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats we are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunication failures internet failures security breaches and other catastrophic events exposure to various types of cyberattacks such as malware computer viruses worms or other malicious acts as well as human error could also potentially disrupt our operations or result in a significant interruption in the delivery of our goods and services 

advances in computer and software capabilities encryption technology and other discoveries increase the complexity of our technological environment including how each interact with our various software platforms such advances could delay or hinder our ability to process transactions or could compromise the integrity of our data resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations we also may experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our information systems unavailable or slow to respond including the interaction of our information systems with those of third parties a lack of sophistication or reliability of our information systems could adversely impact our operations and customer service and could require major repairs or replacements resulting in significant costs and foregone revenue 

  

we have designed numerous procedures and protocols to mitigate cybersecurity risks we continually invest in information technology security and update our business continuity plan in the event a cybersecurity threat occurs we have processes in place to timely notify the appropriate personnel for assessment and resolution we also continue to expand our companywide training programs as part of our efforts to prevent such attacks however the failure to maintain security over and prevent unauthorized access to our data our customers’ personal information including credit card information or data belonging to our suppliers could put us at a competitive disadvantage such a breach could result in damage to our reputation and subject us to 

potential litigation liability fines and penalties resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for a discussion of our base business calculations see the results of operations section below 

2018  financial overview 

financial results 

we delivered solid results in 2018  despite a later than normal start to the year and an earlier end we produced sales growth of 8  in 2018 on top of sales growth of 8  in 2017 our focus on organic growth process discipline and value creation allowed us to convert this top line growth into operating income growth of 10  over 2017  

base business sales grew 7  over last year fueled by continued demand for discretionary products such as building materials lighting and swimming pool equipment gross profit in creased 8  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017  gross margin grew 10 basis points to 290  for 2018  compared to 289  in 2017  we attribute much of the gross margin improvement to our execution of supply chain management initiatives in a higher than normal inflationary environment in our industry 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses in creased 7  compared to 2017  with base business operating expenses up 5  over last year the increase in base business operating expenses was primarily due to higher growthdriven labor and freight expenses as well as greater facilityrelated costs as a percentage of net sales operating expenses declined 10  basis points 

operating income for the year increased 10  to 3139 million  up from 2844 million  in 2017  operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin increased to 105  in 2018  compared to 102  in 2017  

both accounting standards update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which we adopted on january 1 2017 and us tax reform enacted in december 2017 impacted our income tax provision in 2018  and 2017  our effective tax rate was 201 in 2018 and 290 in 2017 we recorded a 153 million  or 036  per diluted share benefit from asu 201609 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to a benefit of 126 million  or  024  per diluted share realized in the same period in 2017 excluding the benefits from asu 201609 our effective tax rate was 253 in 2018 and 337 in 2017 we expect our annual effective tax rate excluding the benefit from asu 201609 for 2019 will approximate 255 which is consistent with 2018 and a reduction compared to our historical rate of approximately 385 due to the impact of us tax reform 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 22  compared to 2017  while earnings per share was up 25  to 562  per diluted share excluding the impacts of asu 201609 discussed above diluted earnings per share increased 23  over last year 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations was  1187 million  in 2018  combined with 1465 million  in net proceeds from borrowings cash from operating activities helped fund the following initiatives 

 

total net receivables including pledged receivables in creased 6  compared to december 31 2017  reflective of fourth quarter sales growth and recent acquisitions our allowance for doubtful accounts was 62 million  at december 31 2018  and 39 million  at december 31 2017  primarily reflecting additional specific reserves for certain customers our days sales outstanding ratio as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis was 301 days at december 31 2018  and 298 days at december 31 2017  

inventory levels grew 25  to 6726 million  at december 31 2018  compared to 5365 million  at december 31 2017  primarily related to increased inventory purchases ahead of greaterthannormal vendor price increases our reserve for inventory obsolescence was 77 million  at december 31 2018  compared to 63 million  at december 31 2017  our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis were 32 times at december 31 2018  and 35  times at december 31 2017  

total debt outstanding of  6668 million  at december 31 2018   in creased 1471 million  or 28  compared to december 31 2017  primarily to fund the additional inventory purchases discussed above and share repurchases 

current trends and outlook 

while market conditions have been generally favorable the past year a number of factors weigh on our industry including lagging new home construction tighter lending standards and the slower progression of a younger generation burdened by student debt and underemployment labor availability and cost have also become issues in recent years limiting our customers’ ability to fully meet consumer demand particularly in construction and renovation markets 

the postrecession market environment from 2010 to 2018 was characterized by the cautious recovery of consumer spending modest housing recovery and low inflation however in terms of homeowners investing in their existing homes discretionary expenditures including backyard renovations flourished over this time period we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate greater growth over the next five years 

although some constraints exist around residential construction activities economic trends indicate that consumer spending has largely recovered and we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent long term growth opportunities in our industry additionally recent regulation passed by the us department of energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps for swimming pools must be variable speed by july 2021 this mandate coupled with additional product developments and technological advancements offers further growth opportunities over the next few years 

while we estimate that new pool construction increased to approximately 80000  new units in 2018  construction levels are still down approximately 65  compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 50 from what we consider normal levels favorable weather plays a role in industry growth by accelerating growth in any given year while unfavorable weather impedes growth for 2018 we started the year off strong but a delayed spring resulted in a later than normal start to the swimming pool season and we finished the year with an earlier end based on weather trends in contrast in 2017 specifically our industry experienced modestly favorable weather overall despite the severe storms that impacted our industry in texas and florida in september and october in 2016 an earlier start to the swimming pool season due to warmer than usual temperatures and overall favorable weather throughout the rest of the year benefited the industry as a whole in establishing our outlook each year we base our growth assumptions on normal weather conditions and do not incorporate alternative weather predictions into our guidance 

we established our initial outlook for 2019  based on reasonable expectations of organic market share growth ongoing leverage of infrastructure and continuous process improvements for 2019  we expect the macroeconomic environment in the united states will be quite similar to 2018  we expect to continue to gain market share through our comprehensive service and product offerings which we continually diversify through internal sourcing initiatives and expansion into new markets we also plan to broaden our geographic presence by opening 4  to 6  new sales centers in 2019  and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise 

the following section summarizes our outlook for 2019  

 

 

 

 

in 2019  we expect our effective tax rate will approximate 255 excluding the impact of asu 201609 this projected rate is a reduction from our historical rate of approximately 385 our effective tax rate is dependent upon our results of operations and may change if actual results are different from our current expectations particularly any significant changes in our geographic mix due to asu 201609 requirements we expect our effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter particularly in periods when employees elect to exercise their vested stock options or when restrictions on sharebased awards lapse based on our december 31 2018  stock price we estimate that we have approximately 72 million  in unrealized excess tax benefits related to stock options that will expire in the second quarter of 2019 and restricted awards that will vest in 2019 we may recognize additional tax benefits related to stock option exercises in 2019 from grants that expire in years after 2019 for which we have not included any expected benefits in our guidance the estimated impact related to asu 201609 is subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options we recorded a 153 million  benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2018  related to asu 201609 

we project that 2019  earnings will be in the range of 605  to 635  per diluted share including an estimated 018  favorable impact from asu 201609 excluding the impact of timing differences from our strategic inventory purchases in the second half of 2018 we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2019  and subject to additional authorization by our board of directors we anticipate that we will use 1500 million to 2000 million in cash for share repurchases 

on january 1 2019 we adopted asu 201602 leases we do not expect the new accounting pronouncement to have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows for additional details see note 1 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions changes in the economy and the housing market our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k also see “cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” prior to item 1a 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require 

payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

similar to our business our customers’ businesses are seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging these reserves range from 005 for amounts currently due to up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectability based on a combination of factors including 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 006  of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales approximated 007  in 2018  005  in 2017  and 007  in 2016  we expect that writeoffs will range from 005 to 010 of net sales in 2019  

at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year end allowance for doubtful accounts balance to i current year writeoffs and ii any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2018  pretax income would change by approximately 12 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 002  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2018  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently turn at slower rates 

we classify products into 13 classes at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the expected sellable period which is the previous 12 months for most products all inventory is included in these classes except for special order nonstock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 



there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory at net realizable value we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months’ usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year end obsolescence reserve balance to i current year inventory writeoffs and ii the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2018  pretax income would change by approximately 15 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 003  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2018  

vendor programs 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors or our net cost of products sold and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor programs as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount earned based on our expectation of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward the attainment of various levels within certain vendor programs we accrue vendor program benefits on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including changes in economic conditions and weather changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors 

we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor program benefits accrual may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase levels in the first quarter of the subsequent year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor credits received to the prior year vendor receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our vendor program estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tjca or the act was enacted which significantly changed us tax law in accordance with accounting standards codification topic asc 740 income taxes  we are required to account for the new requirements in the period that includes the date of enactment the act reduced the overall corporate income tax rate to 21 created a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings broadened the tax base and allowed for the immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property due to the complexities presented by the act particularly for companies with multinational operations the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 sab 118 to provide guidance to companies who were not able to complete their accounting in the period of enactment prior to the reporting deadlines under the guidance in sab 118 provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates were allowable for companies that had not yet completed their accounting for certain elements under the act as a result of this guidance we recorded a provisional net benefit to our income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 as of december 31 2018 we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the act which did not result in a material adjustment to our provisional amount for the global intangible low tax income gilti provisions of the act we have elected an accounting policy to record gilti as period costs if and when incurred 

as of december 31 2018  united states income taxes were not provided on the earnings or cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the provisions of the transition tax from us tax reform as we have historically invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to fund current cash flow needs in the countries where held additional income tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings and cash balances is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation we determined not to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of us tax reform    

we operate in 39  states 1  united states territory and 12  foreign countries we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities and the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

each year we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns based on this hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate differences between our effective income tax rate and federal and state statutory tax rates are primarily due to valuation allowances recorded for certain of our international subsidiaries with tax losses 

performancebased compensation accrual 

the compensation committee of our board compensation committee annually reviews our compensation structure to oversee management’s implementation of maintaining a program that attracts retains develops and motivates employees without leading to unnecessary risk taking our compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including operating income and diluted earnings per share eps 

we use an annual cash performance award annual bonus to focus corporate behavior on shortterm goals for growth financial performance and other specific financial and business improvement metrics management sets the company’s annual bonus objectives at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year management also establishes specific business improvement objectives for both our operating units and corporate employees the compensation committee approves objectives for annual bonus plans involving executive management 

we also utilize our mediumterm threeyear strategic plan incentive program spip to provide senior management with an additional cashbased payforperformance award based on the achievement of specified earnings growth objectives payouts through the spip are based on threeyear compound annual growth rates cagrs of our diluted eps 

we record annual performancebased compensation accruals based on operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives starting in june and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated performancebased compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans if any 

we record spip accruals based on our total expected eps for the current fiscal year and earnings growth estimates for the succeeding two years we base our current fiscal year estimates on the same assumptions used for our annual bonus calculation and we base our forwardlooking estimates on historical growth trends and our projections for the remainder of the threeyear performance periods 

our quarterly performancebased compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year each year we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year end to determine the accuracy of our performance‑based compensation estimates based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our performancebased compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is our largest intangible asset at december 31 2018  our goodwill balance was 1885 million  representing approximately 15  of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we perform a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units falls below its carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we perform a calculation to measure impairment which includes valuing the tangible and intangible assets we recognize any impairment loss in operating income 

since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level we define a reporting unit as an individual sales center as of october 1 2018  we had 223  reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the most significant goodwill balance for a reporting unit was 57 million  and the average goodwill balance was 08 million  

in october of 2018  2017  and 2016  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level in the third quarter of 2016 we recorded a 06 million goodwill impairment charge related to an atrisk reporting unit in quebec canada this location’s results came in above expectations at the end of both the 2018 and 2017 swimming pool seasons and as of december 31 2018  the remaining goodwill balance for this reporting unit was 17 million 

  

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows we project future cash flows using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates operating margins discount rates and multiples these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium our aggregate estimated fair values fell in line with our market capitalization which we consider to be reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test to facilitate a sensitivity analysis we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate to reflect more conservative discounted cash flow assumptions the sensitivity of a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate our sensitivity analysis generated a fair value estimate significantly below our market capitalization and resulted in the identification of no goodwill impairments and no additional atrisk locations 

  

based on our 2018 goodwill impairment analysis we consider our reporting units in australia as most at risk for goodwill impairment we entered australia in july 2014 with the acquisition of a controlling interest in pool systems pty ltd psl the previous owner of psl provided executive oversight until our purchase of the noncontrolling interest in june 2017 since 2014 we have continued to expand our operations in australia via one sales center opening and the acquisitions of newline pool products in july 2017 and pool power in january 2018 the most sensitive assumptions related to our fair values for these locations relate to future projected operating results and management’s ability to effectively leverage our operating structure and manage costs as we expand our presence as of december 31 2018  our aggregate goodwill balance for our five reporting units in australia was 40 million 

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting units discussed above impairment charges would decrease operating income negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for details 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2018  2017  and 2016  we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



 

when calculating our base business results we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2018  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 8  compared to 2017  with 7  of this increase coming from base business sales growth we started the year off strong but multiple storms in march hindered our customers’ ability to complete projects and cold temperatures and snow in our seasonal markets delayed pool openings through april our seasonal markets finally warmed up in may 2018 allowing us to serve the pentup demand and generate solid sales growth through the remainder of the second and third quarters despite several occurrences of severe weather during the third quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018  much cooler and wetter weather patterns made pool construction and remodeling activities from texas to the east coast difficult for our customers to pursue further the comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017  was especially tough given the favorable weather last year in our yearround markets which drive most of our sales in our seasonally slower fourth quarter and the revenue generated from the hurricane irma recovery in florida in the fourth quarter of 2017  despite a later than normal start to the season and an earlier end we produced 8  sales growth in 2018  on top of sales growth of 8  in 2017  

the following factors benefited our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings such as building materials and equipment evidence increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas including pool construction and pool remodeling as well as equipment upgrades in 2018 sales for equipment such as swimming pool heaters pumps lights and filters increased 7  and collectively represented approximately 27  of net sales this increase reflects both the growth of replacement activity and continued demand for higher‑priced more energyefficient products sales of building materials which includes tile grew 11  compared to 2017  and represented approximately 12  of net sales in 2018  

sales to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities are included in the appropriate existing product categories and growth in this area is reflected in the numbers above sales to these customers increased 11  compared to 2017  and represented 5  of our consolidated net sales for 2018 

in terms of quarterly performance base business sales increased 5 in the first quarter of 2018  base business sales then increased 6 in the second quarter of 2018  despite a slow start to the quarter as discussed above in in the third quarter of 2018  base business sales increased 8 despite severe weather events and elevated rainfall in texas and wildfires in california for our seasonally slowest fourth quarter base business sales increased 5  in 2018  on top of 13 base business sales growth achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017  in addition to the sales discussion above see further details of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  below 

gross profit 



gross margin for 2018  increased 10 basis points compared to 2017  we attribute much of the gross margin improvement to our execution of supply chain management initiatives in a higher than normal inflationary environment in our industry in the second half of 2018 we made strategic inventory purchases in advance of greaterthannormal vendor price increases 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 7  compared to 2017  with base business operating expenses up 5  the increase in base business operating expenses was primarily due to higher growthdriven labor and freight expenses as well as greater facilityrelated expenditures offset by lower performancebased compensation 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net increased 57 million  compared to 2017  this increase mostly reflects higher interest expense on our debt average outstanding debt was 5791 million in 2018  versus 5040 million in 2017  our 2018  average outstanding debt balance reflects greater borrowings primarily to fund working capital growth our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 33  in 2018  compared to 27  in 2017

our effective income tax rate was 201  at december 31 2018  and 290  at december 31 2017  our provision for income taxes in 2017 was positively impacted by both us tax reform and asu 201609 we recorded a 153 million  benefit from asu 201609 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to a benefit of 126 million realized in the same period in 2017 excluding the benefits from asu 201609 our effective tax rate was 253 and 337 for the years ended 2018 and 2017  respectively 

  

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 22  to 2345 million  in 2018  compared to 1916 million  in 2017  earnings per share increased 25  to 562  per diluted share compared to 451  per diluted share in 2017  excluding the 036  per diluted share impact of asu 201609 in 2018  and 024  in 2017  diluted earnings per share increased 23  over last year 

fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



for an explanation of how we calculate base business please refer to the discussion of base business u nder the heading “fiscal year   2018   compared to fiscal year   2017 ”    

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2017 to the year ended december 31 2016 we excluded acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below 



 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2017 



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 8 compared to 2016 despite one less selling day our 7 increase in base business sales generated much of this growth we experienced modestly favorable weather during the swimming pool season which ended with severe storms in september and october in both texas and florida by the end of the fourth quarter we mostly recovered sales lost over these time periods 

the following factors benefited our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings such as building materials and equipment evidence increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas including pool construction pool remodeling as well as equipment upgrades in 2017 sales for equipment such as swimming pool heaters pumps and lights increased 10 and collectively represented approximately 23 of net sales this increase reflects both the growth of replacement activity and continued demand for higher‑priced more energyefficient products sales of building materials which includes tile grew 13 compared to 2016 and represented approximately 10 of net sales in 2017 

sales to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities are included in the appropriate existing product categories and growth in this area is reflected in the numbers above these sales increased 10 compared to 2016 and represented 5 of our consolidated net sales for 2017 excluding the recent acquisition of lincoln aquatics 

in terms of quarterly performance base business sales increased 5 in the first quarter of 2017 despite a 2 decline in sales related to customer early buy purchases base business sales then increased 7 in the second quarter of 2017 under overall neutral weather conditions for most of the quarter despite the severe weather events in the third quarter of 2017 and one less selling day compared to the same period in 2016 base business sales increased 6 in the third quarter for our seasonally slowest fourth quarter base business sales increased 13 in 2017 reflecting strong consumer demand excellent execution by our team the recovery following hurricane irma and overall favorable weather conditions see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  below 

gross profit 



gross margin for 2017 increased 10 basis points compared to 2016 mostly reflecting product mix coupled with benefits from sourcing initiatives 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 7 compared to 2016 with base business operating expenses up 5 the increase in base business operating expenses was primarily due to higher growthdriven labor and freight expenses as well as greater facilityrelated expenditures equitybased compensation and technology spending as we continue to invest in our business base business operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 30 basis points over 2016 as we continued to leverage our existing infrastructure 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net increased 07 million compared to 2016 average outstanding debt was 5040 million for 2017 versus 4246 million for 2016 our 2017 average outstanding debt balance reflects greater borrowings primarily to fund working capital growth our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 27 for 2017 compared to 22 for 2016 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 290 at december 31 2017 and 385 at december 31 2016 our provision for income taxes for 2017 was positively impacted by both us tax reform and asu 201609 as a result of the recently enacted tax legislation we recorded a provisional tax benefit of 120 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 which primarily reflects the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability in addition to the impact from tax reform we recorded a 126 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017 related to our adoption of asu 201609 

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 29 to 1916 million in 2017 compared to 1490 million in 2016 earnings per share increased 30 to 451 per diluted share compared to 347 per diluted share in 2016 excluding the 028 per diluted share impact of tax reform and the 024 per diluted share impact of asu 201609 diluted earnings per share increased 15 over last year 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

for discussion regarding the effects seasonality and weather have on our business see item 1 “business” of this form 10k 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2018  and 2017  we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  



  

weather impacts on fiscal year 2018  to fiscal year 2017  comparisons 

storm activity as well as coolerthannormal temperatures late in the first quarter of 2018 inhibited our first quarter sales growth much of the atlantic coast experienced belowaverage temperatures in march of 2018 which caused pools to open later than in 2017 and greater storm activity in texas and the central united states and aboveaverage precipitation in california delayed construction activity during the first quarter of 2018 in contrast unseasonably mild weather benefited sales in the first quarter of 2017 as texas and surrounding markets experienced record warm temperatures 

while warming trends started out slow in the second quarter of 2018 the unfavorable weather comparisons turned around by the end of the quarter april 2018 sales struggled as much of the country experienced cold to record cold temperatures this year in contrast to warm to record warm temperatures in 2017 with the exception of florida where it rained most of may and into june and california which generally experienced a coolerthanusual spring 2018 results in the last two months of the second quarter benefited from the warm weather throughout the country and helped relieve the effects of the slow start from earlier in the year 

california wildfires large amounts of rain throughout texas and hurricane florence in the carolinas all impacted our sales in the third quarter of 2018 likewise severe storms in the third quarter of 2017 particularly hurricanes irma and harvey hindered our sales growth in florida and texas last year although texas largely recovered by the end of september 2017 in the third quarter of 2018 the west experienced record heat and belowaverage rainfall while temperatures were also aboveaverage in the central united states and the midwest but each experienced aboveaverage rainfall these weather patterns were consistent with the third quarter of 2017 resulting in overall similar weather comparisons much of the united states experienced coolerthannormal temperatures and higher than average precipitation in the fourth quarter of 2018 particularly in texas making it difficult for customers to initiate and complete projects over this time period 

weather impacts on fiscal year 2017  to fiscal year 2016  comparisons 

unseasonably mild weather benefited sales in the first quarter of 2017 however while favorable weather trends early in the year normally have a seasonally larger impact the comparison to the first quarter of 2016 was especially tough given the benefit of the warmerthannormal weather across nearly all markets in the united states in the first quarter of 2016 for the first quarter of 2017 texas and surrounding markets experienced record warm temperatures which when coupled with belowaverage precipitation for that area spurred higher sales growth in two of the more seasonal regions where we operate belowaverage temperatures in the north and aboveaverage precipitation in the west negatively impacted our first quarter 2017 sales growth 

cold and wet weather throughout the midsouth and north impacted those seasonal markets in the middle of the second quarter of 2017 while the weather impact overall for the quarter was fairly neutral temperatures and precipitation throughout most areas other than those described above were normal with only texas benefiting from drier weather in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the aboveaverage rainfall experienced in the same period of 2016 

severe storms in the third quarter of 2017 particularly hurricanes irma and harvey hindered our sales growth in florida and texas although texas largely recovered by the end of september in the central and midwest temperatures were normal for the third quarter contrasting with the aboveaverage temperatures in the third quarter of 2016 the west experienced record heat and normal rainfall in the third quarter of 2017 similar to the aboveaverage heat in the same period of 2016 overall the united states experienced favorable weather in most of the fourth quarter of 2017 particularly in florida which allowed for sales recovery following hurricane irma 

geographic areas 

since all of our sales centers have similar operations and share similar economic characteristics we aggregate our sales centers into a single reportable segment for additional details see note 1 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent capital structure including a modest amount of debt and returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

capital expenditures were 11 of net sales in 2018  and 14 of net sales in both 2017  and 2016  our higher capital spending in 2017  and 2016  related to expanding our facilities and purchasing delivery vehicles to address growth over the last 5 years capital expenditures have averaged roughly 10 of net sales 

our capital spending primarily relates to leasehold improvements delivery and service vehicles and information technology we focus our capital expenditure plans on the needs of our sales centers in 2018  we performed an evaluation of our enterprise resource planning system although we do not anticipate a complete replacement of our enterprise resource planning system we do plan to migrate our current system to a new environment over a number of years this plan requires modest incremental capital investments over that time frame rather than substantial spending for 2019  based on management’s current plans we project capital expenditures will continue to approximate the historical average 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 21 2019  492 million  of the current board authorized amount under our authorized share repurchase plan remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations of  1187 million  for 2018  decreased compared to 2017   primarily due to timing differences from the preprice increase inventory purchases which should benefit 2019 cash flows as the inventory is sold in 2017  cash provided by operations improved compared to 2016  primarily due to our net income growth partially offset by changes in working capital excluding the net income benefit from the 2017 tax changes cash provided by operating activities approximated net income in 2017 

cash used in investing activities decreased in 2018  due to a decrease of 103 million   in payments for acquisitions compared to 2017 and a   78 million  reduction in net capital expenditures between years as discussed above higher capital spending in 2017 addressed our need to expand our fleet of delivery vehicles and make investments in equipment and technology related to the decrease from 2016 to 2017 our   2017   cash used in investing activities reflects a decrease of   69 million   in net payments to fund acquisitions partially offset by a 50 million  increase of net capital expenditures 

cash used in financing activities decreased in 2018  primarily due to increased net borrowings on our debt arrangements we had 1465 million  of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2018  compared to 821 million  in 2017  primarily to fund greater share repurchases and the preprice increase inventory purchases we repurchased 1836 million of shares in the open market in 2018  compared to 1432 million in 2017  in 2016  we had net proceeds from our debt arrangements of 1094 million  while we repurchased 1756 million of shares in the open market 

future sources and uses of cash 

to supplement cash from operations as our primary source of working capital we will continue to utilize our two major credit facilities which are the amended and restated revolving credit facility the credit facility and the receivables securitization facility the receivables facility for additional details regarding these facilities see note 5 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

revolving credit facility 

our credit facility provides for 7500 million in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 8250 million the credit facility matures on september 29 2022 we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2018  there was 5501 million  outstanding a 48 million  standby letter of credit outstanding and 1951 million  available for borrowing under the credit facility we utilize interest rate swap contracts and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on the credit facility as of december 31 2018  we had three interest rate swap contracts in place that became effective on october 19 2016  these swap contracts were previously forwardstarting and were amended in october 2015 to bring the fixed rates per our forwardstarting contracts in line with current market rates and extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility now effective these amended swap contracts convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 2273 on a notional amount of 750 million and 2111 on two separate notional amounts one 250 million and the other 500 million totaling 750 million interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swap contracts is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility these interest rate swap contracts will terminate on november 20 2019 

in july 2016 we entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap contract to extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility to its maturity date at that time this swap contract will convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 11425 on a notional amount of 1500 million the contract becomes effective on november 20 2019 and terminates on november 20 2020 

the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2018  was approximately 35  excluding commitment fees 

financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2018  the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 

on january 1 2019 we adopted asu 201602 leases  which requires that we record most of our leases on our balance sheets but we expect to recognize expenses in a manner similar to current guidance our credit facility agreement requires that we calculate our financial covenants by excluding the effects of the new standard we do not expect asu 201602 will have a material impact on our financial covenant calculations for additional details regarding our adoption of this new accounting pronouncement see note 1 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends additionally we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50 limit described above so long as i the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50 limit and ii our average total leverage ratio is less than 300 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice 

under the credit facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

receivables securitization facility 

as amended on october 31 2018 our twoyear receivables facility offers us a lowercost form of financing with a peak funding capacity of up to 2950 million  between may 1 and june 30 which includes an additional seasonal funding capacity that is available between march 1 and july 31 other funding capacities range from 950 million  to 2800 million  throughout the remaining months of the year 

the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a whollyowned subsidiary the securitization subsidiary the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain thirdparty financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds limited to the applicable funding capacities upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due 

the receivables facility contains terms and conditions including representations covenants and conditions precedent customary for transactions of this type additionally an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio average total funded debtebitda of 325 to 100 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio ebitdarcash interest expense plus rental expense of 225 to 100 

at december 31 2018  there was 1085 million  outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 33  excluding commitment fees 

compliance and future availability 

as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements under our credit facility and our receivables facility we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2019  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2018  our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 



the table below contains estimated interest payments in thousands related to our longterm debt obligations presented in the table above we calculated estimates of future interest payments based on the december 31 2018  outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2018  for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swap contracts to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility and the receivables facility for certain of our contractual obligations such as unrecognized tax benefits uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time as such we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table see notes 5 and 7 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for additional discussion related to our debt and more information related to our unrecognized tax benefits 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2018  there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts for the credit facility the portions of our outstanding balances under the credit facility and the receivables facility that were not covered by our interest rate swap contracts were subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2018  related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under the credit facility excluding the accordion feature and the offseason maximum amount available under the receivables facility in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility and the receivables facility increased by 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 77 million  and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 014  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2018  the maximum amount available under the credit facility is 7500 million  excluding the 750 million  accordion feature and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility is 2550 million  excluding the 400 million  seasonal increase in capacity available from march 1 to july 31 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

changes in the exchange rates for the functional currencies of our international subsidiaries as shown in the table below may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 9  of total net sales in 2018  our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2019  and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us  or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and related products in the united states the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2017  we operated 351  sales centers in north america europe south america and australia through our four distribution networks 

 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools technological advancements and the development of energyefficient and more aesthetically attractive products additionally the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this market area 

the irrigation industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize long‑term growth rates similar to the pool industry as irrigation system installations and landscaping often occur in tandem with new singlefamily home construction we believe the continued trend in increased housing starts also offers significant growth opportunities for the irrigation industry 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

 

almost 60  of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenancerelated goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic along with relatively consistent annual inflationary price increases of 1 to 2 on average passed on by manufacturers and distributors has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2016 pk data inc reports 

  

the replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25  of consumer spending in the pool industry the activity in this market which includes major swimming pool remodeling is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises just over 15  of consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool outdoor living and irrigation products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market irrigation activities account for approximately 50  of total spending in the irrigation industry with the remaining 50  of spending related to power equipment landscape and specialty outdoor products and accessories as such our irrigation business is more heavily weighted toward new home construction activities compared to our pool business over the last five years our irrigation business has benefited from the continued slow recovery of singlefamily home construction as irrigation system installations and landscape projects typically correlate with but lag new home construction 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments and equipment replacement we believe that over the long term singlefamily housing turnover and home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and employment 

while we estimate that new pool construction has increased to approximately 75000  new units in 2017  from the historically low levels experienced during the economic downturn construction levels are still down approximately 65  compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 50  to 55  from what we consider normal levels 

we believe there is potential for continued market recovery over the next several years the economic downturn which spanned from late 2006 to early 2010 and reached its low point in 2009 also referred to as the great recession created a build up of deferred replacement and remodeling activity which we have largely fulfilled over the past seven years we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate greater growth over the next four to seven years additionally we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential outdoor living investment we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further replacement remodeling and new construction activity and that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 7  over this time period as economic trends indicate that consumer spending has largely recovered and that residential construction activities will likely continue to improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

over the last five years we estimate the pool industry grew from 2  to 4  per year with favorable weather accelerating growth in any given year and unfavorable weather impeding growth our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affects our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can accelerate or delay the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets in the united states and canada weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

in 2017 specifically our industry experienced modestly favorable weather overall despite the severe storms that impacted our industry in texas and florida in september and october due to the repairs required following major storms sales mostly recovered by the end of the year in 2016 an earlier start to the pool season due to warmer than usual temperatures and overall favorable weather throughout the rest of the year benefited the industry as a whole in 2015 excessive precipitation impacted our industry in the second quarter however a mild fall and delayed winter alleviated any contraction in industry growth rates 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers creating exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are as follows 

 

we promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives including social media we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design product merchandising business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes in addition to these programs we feature consumer showrooms in over 80 of our sales centers and host our annual retail summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry we also act as a daytoday resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management other key internal growth initiatives include the continued expansion of both our product offerings as described in the “customers and products” section below and our distribution networks 

with our 2008 acquisition of national pool tile group inc we added a market leading brand of pool tile and composite pool finish products and gained a position in a wider market to increase operating efficiency and improve market reach we have consolidated and repositioned npt standalone sales centers and established npt showrooms within certain existing sales centers in addition to our 16  standalone npt sales centers we currently have over 80 scp and superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where landscape and swimming pool contractors as well as homeowners can view and select pool components including pool tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades and serve as stocking locations for our npt branded products 

we feel the growth opportunities for the npt network closely align with those of our other networks as we see continued opportunity to expand under the npt brand we also expect potential expansion of the network by broadening our product range and sourcing capabilities as more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand while leveraging our existing pool and irrigation customer base we feel the development of our npt network is a natural extension of our distribution model while we are currently enjoying an expanding economy and improving housing market which help fuel demand for these products this business is more sensitive to these external market factors compared to our business overall 

we have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers given the external environment we have increased our focus on new sales center openings complemented by strategic acquisitions and consolidations depending on our market presence since the beginning of 2015  we have opened 11  new sales centers including 1  new sales center in 2017  we expect to open between 4  and 6  new sales centers in 2018  since the beginning of 2015  we have completed 9  acquisitions consisting of 24  sales centers net of sales center consolidations within one year of acquisition we plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past 10 years we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases we estimate that annual price inflation between 2015  and 2017  was consistent with the tenyear average we anticipate price inflation will vary some by product lines but will approximate the tenyear average overall in 2018  

customers and products 

we serve roughly 120000  customers in 2017  sales to our largest 100 customers collectively accounted for just under 10 of our total sales we estimate that sales to our largest 1000 customers represented approximately 25 of our total sales in 2017  notably 98 of our customers are small familyowned businesses with relatively limited capital resources and generated a large majority of our sales in 2017  most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors and specialty retailers employing no more than ten employees in many cases working alone or with a limited crew these customers also buy from other distributors mass merchants home stores and certain specialty and internet retailers 

we sell our products primarily to the following types of customers 

 

we conduct our operations through 351  sales centers in north america europe australia and south america our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california texas florida and arizona collectively representing approximately 52  of our 2017  net sales in 2017  we generated approximately 94 of our sales in north america 5 in europe and 1 in south america and australia combined while we continue to expand both domestically and internationally we expect this geographic mix to be similar over the next few years references to product line and product category data throughout this form 10k generally reflect data related to the north american swimming pool market as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations 

we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 180000  manufacturer and pool corporation branded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and related products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry we sell the following types of products 

  

 

we currently have over 500  product lines and over 50 product categories based on our 2017  product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category represented approximately 12  of total net sales for 2017 and 13  of our total net sales in 2016  and 2015  no other product category accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

our maintenance repair and replacement products are generally described as follows 

 

in 2017  the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for almost 60 of our sales and gross profits while just over 40 of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools during the great recession sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction and deferred remodeling and replacement activity the current trend reflects a shift back toward a greater percentage of our sales coming from major refurbishment and replacement products due to an ongoing recovery of these activities since levels reached their historic low point in 2009 

discretionary demand for products related to pool construction and remodeling has been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth we have realized sales growth over the past five years due to our ongoing expansion of these product offerings and the steady improvement in new construction remodeling and economic trends however new pool construction remains approximately 65  below peak historic levels and approximately 50  to 55  below what we believe to be normal levels we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets then we evaluate the performance in these markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

over the last several years we have increased our product offerings and service abilities related to commercial swimming pools including the acquisition of lincoln pool products in april 2017 we consider this area to be a key growth opportunity as we focus more attention on providing to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities however we are leveraging our existing networks and relationships to supply to this market 

growth in the replacement and refurbishment market following the great recession led to product and customer mix changes including a shift in consumer spending to higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps high efficiency heaters and irrigation and related equipment which positively contribute to our sales and gross profit growth but negatively impact our gross margin we expect continued demand for these products but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives including growth in our higher margin private label and exclusive products plex and our expansion of building materials product offerings has helped offset these gross margin declines and will lead to somewhat flat gross margin trends over the next few years 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network we distribute irrigation and related products through our horizon network and tile decking materials and interior pool finish products through our npt network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool market primarily for two reasons 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based on their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixed‑use zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions for additional information regarding our inventory management see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  inventory obsolescence” of this form 10k 

we also operate four  centralized shipping locations csls that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool corporation which are referred to as early buy purchases these early buy purchases typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors offering the best overall terms and service to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20  10  and 8  respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2017  

competition 

we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products based on industry knowledge and available data and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of irrigation and related products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies we also face competition both directly and indirectly from both storebased and internet mass market retailers and large pool supply retailers who primarily buy directly from manufacturers 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of california texas florida and arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and irrigation supply distribution are 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather 

for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 4000  people at december 31 2017  given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200  to 500  employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forward‑looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of earnings and other financial performance measures statements of management’s expectations regarding our plans and objectives and industry general economic and other forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” “should” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward‑looking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

consumer discretionary spending affects our sales and is impacted by factors outside of our control including general economic conditions disposable income levels consumer confidence and access to credit in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products may decline often corresponding with declines in discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction maintenance and repair products and certain replacement equipment which are required to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for approximately 85  of net sales and gross profits related to our swimming pool business however the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbishment activity even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pools irrigation systems and outdoor living products between late 2006 and early 2010 the unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems although we have seen improvement since 2010 tightening consumer credit could prevent consumers from obtaining financing for pool irrigation and related outdoor projects which could negatively impact our sales of constructionrelated products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as irrigation installations and landscape maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions which could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations and negatively impact our sales for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however any failure to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20  10  and 8  respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2017  a decision by our largest suppliers acting individually or in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers could also adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

within our industry we directly compete against various regional and local distributors as they compete against our customers for the business of pool owners and other enduse customers we indirectly compete against mass market retailers and large pool or irrigation supply retailers as they purchase the great majority of their needs directly from manufacturers and to a lesser extent with internet retailers as they purchase the majority of their needs from distributors outside of our industry we compete indirectly with alternative suppliers of big ticket consumer discretionary products such as boat and motor home distributors and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry given the density and demand for pool products some geographic markets that we serve also tend to have a higher concentration of competitors than others particularly california texas florida and arizona these states encompass our four largest markets and represented approximately 52  of our net sales in 2017  

more aggressive competition by store and internetbased mass merchants and large pool or irrigation supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and irrigation related products has remained relatively constant should store‑ and internetbased mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or irrigation industries or increase the breadth of their pool and irrigation and related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or irrigation supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel this includes succession planning related to our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through organic market share gains new sales center openings and acquisitions that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since the beginning of 2015  we have opened 11 new sales centers and we have completed 9 acquisitions consisting of 24  sales centers net of sales center consolidations within one year of acquisition while we contemplate continued growth through internal expansion and acquisitions no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2017  we generated approximately 62  of our net sales and 83  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of both swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and irrigation installations and maintenance our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with employment environmental health transportation safety and other governmental regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state local and international employment environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

management has processes in place to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements however failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to regulatory matters in amounts that may be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 

the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulations is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemicals increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustibles and oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations which accounted for 9  of our total net sales in 2017  expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

for foreignsourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products and there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

changes in tax laws and accounting standards related to tax matters have caused and may in the future cause fluctuations in our effective tax rate 

taxation and tax policy changes tax rate changes new tax laws revised tax law interpretations and changes in accounting standards and guidance related to tax matters may cause fluctuations in our effective tax rate the tax cuts and jobs act tjca or the act enacted in december 2017 significantly changes us tax law our 2017 financial results include estimates regarding the effects of the act which are based on our current interpretation of this legislation and on reasonable estimates and may change as a result of new guidance issued by regulators or changes in our estimates additionally in the first quarter of 2017 we adopted accounting standards update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  on a prospective basis our projections of financial statement impacts related to asu 201609 are subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options excess tax benefits or deficiencies recognized under asu 201609 vary from quarter to quarter and past results may not be indicative of future results our effective tax rate may also be impacted by changes in the geographic mix of our earnings 

we depend on a global network of suppliers to source our products product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our sales and expose us to legal claims 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell and distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation and psl branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase the risk of claims may also be greater with respect to products manufactured by thirdparty suppliers outside the united states particularly in china uncertainties with respect to foreign legal systems may adversely affect us in resolving claims arising from our foreign sourced products even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and our company 

we rely on information technology systems to support our business operations any disturbance or breach of our technological infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally failure to maintain the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

information technology supports several aspects of our business   including among others product sourcing pricing customer service transaction processing financial reporting collections and cost management our ability to operate effectively on a day‑to‑day basis and accurately report our results depends on a solid technological infrastructure which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats we are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunication failures internet failures security breaches and other catastrophic events exposure to various types of cyberattacks such as malware computer viruses worms or other malicious acts as well as human error could also potentially disrupt our operations or result in a significant interruption in the delivery of our goods and services advances in computer and software capabilities encryption technology and other discoveries increase the complexity of our technological environment including how each interact with our various software platforms and may delay or hinder our ability to process transactions and compromise the integrity of our data which could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we have designed numerous procedures and protocols to mitigate cybersecurity risks we continually invest in information technology security and update our business continuity plan in the event a cybersecurity threat occurs we have processes in place to timely notify the appropriate personnel for assessment and resolution we also continue to expand our companywide training programs as part of our efforts to prevent such attacks however the failure to maintain security over and prevent unauthorized access to our data our customers’ personal information including credit card information or data belonging to our suppliers could put us at a competitive disadvantage such a breach could result in damage to our reputation and subject us to potential litigation liability fines and penalties resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for a discussion of our base business calculations see the results of operations section below 

2017  financial overview 

financial results 

we generated strong results in 2017  on top of excellent performance and favorable weather last year we produced sales growth of 8  in 2017 on top of sales growth of 9  in 2016 and converted this into solid earnings growth primarily due to executing our strategies in pursuit of our mission every day 

net sales in creased 8  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016  pool remodeling equipment replacement and the expansion of building materials and commercial products were the major contributors to base business sales growth of 7  for the year gross profit in creased 9  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016  gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin grew 10 basis points to 289  for 2017  compared to 288  in 2016  

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses in creased 7  compared to 2016  with base business operating expenses up 5  over last year the increase in base business operating expenses was primarily due to higher growthdriven labor and freight expenses as well as greater employee benefit costs equitybased compensation and technology spending as a percentage of net sales operating expenses declined 20  basis points 

operating income for the year increased 11  to 2844 million  up from 2559 million  in 2016  operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin increased to 102  in 2017  compared to 100  in 2016  

our provision for income taxes for 2017 was impacted by both us tax reform and accounting standards update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  as a result of the recently enacted tax legislation we recorded a provisional tax benefit of 120 million  in the fourth quarter of 2017 which primarily reflects the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability in addition to the impact from tax reform we recorded a 126 million  benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017  related to asu 201609 which positively impacted our net income and earnings per share but was partially offset by an increase of approximately 550000  diluted weighted average shares outstanding the combination of both tax reform and asu 201609 resulted in a total net benefit of 052  to our diluted earnings per share in 2017 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 29  compared to 2016  while earnings per share was up 30  to 451  per diluted share excluding the 028  per diluted share impact of tax reform and the 024  per diluted share impact of asu 201609 diluted earnings per share increased 15  over last year 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations was  1753 million  in 2017  combined with 821 million  in net proceeds from borrowings cash from operating activities helped fund the following initiatives 

 

total net receivables including pledged receivables in creased 18  compared to december 31 2016  reflective of fourth quarter sales growth and acquisitions our allowance for doubtful accounts was 39 million  at december 31 2017  and 41 million  at december 31 2016  

inventory levels grew 10  to 5365 million  at december 31 2017  compared to 4861 million  at december 31 2016  our reserve for inventory obsolescence was 63 million  at december 31 2017  compared to 65 million  at december 31 2016  our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis were 35 times at december 31 2017  and 36  times at december 31 2016  

total debt outstanding of  5197 million  at december 31 2017   in creased 816 million  or 19  compared to december 31 2016  primarily to fund share repurchases and working capital growth 

current trends and outlook 

over the last five years we estimate the pool industry grew from 2  to 4  per year due to growth in the installed base of pools which helped drive pool maintenance growth improvement in remodeling and replacement activity and annual growth in the pool construction market improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence employment housing consumer financing and economic expansion largely support our base business growth we feel these positive external trends have promoted increased consumer spending on higher value products that enhance swimming pools and outdoor living spaces our consistent base business sales growth reflects industry growth plus market share gains from existing customers expanding their businesses and our success in newer market initiatives such as hardscapes and commercial pools 

while we estimate that new pool construction increased to approximately 75000  new units in 2017  from the historically low levels experienced during the economic downturn construction levels are still down approximately 65  compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 50  to 55  from what we consider normal levels favorable weather plays a role in industry growth by accelerating growth in any given year while unfavorable weather impedes growth in 2017 specifically our industry experienced modestly favorable weather overall despite the severe storms that impacted our industry in texas and florida in september and october due to the repairs required following major storms sales mostly recovered by the end of the year in 2016 an earlier start to the pool season due to warmer than usual temperatures and overall favorable weather throughout the rest of the year benefited the industry as a whole in 2015 excessive precipitation impacted our industry in the second quarter however a mild fall and delayed winter alleviated any contraction in industry growth rates in establishing our outlook each year we base our growth assumptions on normal weather conditions and do not incorporate alternative weather predictions into our guidance 

we believe there is potential for continued market recovery over the next several years the great recession created a buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity which we have largely fulfilled over the past seven years we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate greater growth over the next four to seven years additionally we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential outdoor living investment we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further replacement remodeling and new construction activity and that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 7  over this time period as economic trends indicate that consumer spending has largely recovered and that residential construction activities will likely continue to improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent long‑term growth opportunities in our industry 

we established our initial outlook for 2018  based on reasonable expectations of organic market share growth ongoing leverage of infrastructure and continuous process improvements for 2018  we expect the macroeconomic environment in the united states will be quite similar to 2017  we expect to continue to gain market share through our comprehensive service and product offerings which we continually diversify through internal sourcing initiatives and expansion into new markets we also plan to broaden our geographic presence by opening 4  to 6  new sales centers in 2018  and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise 

the following section summarizes our outlook for 2018  



our provision for income taxes for 2017 was impacted by both us tax reform and asu 201609 as a result of the recently enacted tax legislation we recorded a provisional tax benefit of 120 million  in the fourth quarter of 2017 which primarily reflects the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability in 2018  we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 255 which is a reduction from our historical rate of approximately 385 both of which exclude the impact of asu 201609 as discussed further in critical accounting estimates below we have not finalized our accounting for the tax effects of tax reform however our net benefit is based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects 

our effective tax rate is dependent upon our results of operations and may change if actual results are different from our current expectations particularly any significant changes in our geographic mix due to asu 201609 requirements we expect our effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter particularly in periods when employees elect to exercise their vested stock options or when restrictions on sharebased awards lapse based on our december 31 2017  stock price we estimate that we have approximately 54 million  in unrealized excess tax benefits related to stock options that will expire in the first quarter of 2018 and restricted awards that will vest in 2018 additional tax benefits could be recognized related to stock option exercises in 2018 from grants that expire in years after 2018 for which we have not included any expected benefits in our guidance the estimated impact related to asu 201609 is subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options we recorded a 126 million  benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017  related to asu 201609 

we project that 2018  earnings will be in the range of 536  to 561  per diluted share including an estimated 013  favorable impact from asu 201609 th is range also reflects our expected 2018 income tax rate including the impact from tax reform legislation enacted in december 2017 we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2018  and subject to additional authorization by our board of directors we anticipate that we will use 1000 million to 1500 million in cash for share repurchases 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k also see “cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” prior to item 1a 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

similar to our business our customers’ businesses are seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging these reserves range from 005 for amounts currently due to up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectability based on a combination of factors including 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 007  of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales approximated 005  in 2017  007  in 2016  and 005  in 2015  we expect that writeoffs will range from 005 to 010 of net sales in 2018  

at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend allowance for doubtful accounts balance to i current year writeoffs and ii any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates but conservative overall as 2017  writeoffs came in at the low end of the expected range based on historical trends while we slightly lowered our general reserve percentage to account for declining writeoffs in recent years our overall reserve methodology and process for estimating specific reserves remains unchanged 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2017  pretax income would change by approximately 08 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 001  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2017  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently turn at slower rates 

we classify products into 13 classes at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the expected sellable period which is the previous 12 months for most products all inventory is included in these classes except for special order nonstock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 



there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory at net realizable value we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months’ usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend obsolescence reserve balance to i current year inventory writeoffs and ii the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2017  pretax income would change by approximately 13 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 002  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2017  

vendor programs 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor programs as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward the attainment of various levels within certain vendor programs we accrue vendor program benefits on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors 

we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor program benefits accrual may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase levels in the first quarter of the subsequent year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor credits received to the prior year vendor receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our vendor program estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act tjca or the act was enacted which significantly changes us tax law in accordance with accounting standards codification topic asc 740 income taxes  we are required to account for the new requirements in the period that includes the date of enactment the act reduces the overall corporate income tax rate to 21 creates a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings broadens the tax base and allows for the immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property due to the complexities presented by the act particularly for companies with multinational operations the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin 118 sab 118 to provide guidance to companies who are not able to complete their accounting in the period of enactment prior to the reporting deadlines under the guidance in sab 118 companies that have not completed their accounting for certain elements of the act but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements this guidance resulted in us recording a provisional net benefit to our income tax provision during the period ended december 31 2017 as of december 31 2017 we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the act but will complete our accounting before the end of the one year period allowed by sab 118 any revisions to our provisional amounts will be recorded in the period when the accounting is complete and will be recorded as a discrete item in our income tax provision in that period for the global intangible low tax income gilti provisions of the act we have elected an accounting policy to record gilti as period costs if and when incurred 

as of december 31 2017  united states income taxes were not provided on earnings or cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the provisions of the transition tax from us tax reform as we have historically invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to fund current cash flow needs in the countries where held additional income tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings and cash balances is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation we are also still evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of us tax reform    

we have operations in 39  states 1  united states territory and 12  foreign countries we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities and the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

each year we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns based on this hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate differences between our effective income tax rate and federal and state statutory tax rates are primarily due to valuation allowances recorded for certain of our international subsidiaries with tax losses 

performancebased compensation accrual 

the compensation committee of our board compensation committee annually reviews our compensation structure to oversee management’s implementation of maintaining a program that attracts retains develops and motivates employees without leading to unnecessary risk taking our compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including operating income and diluted earnings per share eps 

we use an annual cash performance award annual bonus to focus corporate behavior on shortterm goals for growth financial performance and other specific financial and business improvement metrics management sets the company’s annual bonus objectives at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year management also establishes specific business improvement objectives for both our operating units and corporate employees the compensation committee approves objectives for bonus plans involving executive management 

we also utilize our mediumterm threeyear strategic plan incentive program spip to provide senior management with an additional cashbased payforperformance award based upon the achievement of specified earnings growth objectives payouts through the spip are based on threeyear compounded annual growth rates cagrs of our diluted eps 

we record annual performancebased compensation accruals based on operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives starting in june and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated performancebased compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans if any 

we record spip accruals based on our total expected eps for the current fiscal year and cagr estimates for the succeeding two years we base our current fiscal year estimates on the same assumptions used for our annual bonus calculation and our cagr estimates on historical growth rates and projections for the remainder of the threeyear performance periods 

our quarterly performancebased compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year each year we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year end to determine the accuracy of our performance‑based compensation estimates based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our performancebased compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is our largest intangible asset at december 31 2017  our goodwill balance was 1894 million  representing approximately 17  of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units falls below its carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center as of october 1 2017  we had 221  reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the most significant goodwill balance for a reporting unit was 57 million  and the average goodwill balance was 08 million  in october 2017  2016  and 2015  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level in the third quarter of 2016 we recorded a 06 million goodwill impairment charge related to an atrisk reporting unit in quebec canada we continue to monitor this location’s results which came in above expectations at the end of the 2017 pool season as of december 31 2017  the remaining goodwill balance for this reporting unit was 18 million 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows we project future cash flows using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates operating margins discount rates and multiples these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium our aggregate estimated fair values fell in line with our market capitalization which we consider to be reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test to facilitate a sensitivity analysis we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate by 5 to reflect more conservative discounted cash flow assumptions this reduction addresses the sensitivity of a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate our sensitivity analysis generated a fair value estimate significantly below our market capitalization and resulted in the identification of no goodwill impairments and no additional atrisk locations 

  

based on the magnitude of their goodwill balances and their heightened sensitivity to weather we consider our reporting units in quebec canada as most at risk for goodwill impairment results in quebec began to fall below expectations in 2013 largely due to an extended winter and certain execution challenges we cannot be assured of favorable weather conditions in any given year which strongly impact results for our quebec reporting units as of december 31 2017  we have three reporting units in quebec with a total goodwill balance of 28 million  

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting units discussed above impairment charges would decrease operating income negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  the fasb also issued subsequent amendments to asu 201409 to provide clarification on the guidance asu 201409 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 which for us will be in the period beginning january 1 2018 we are substantially complete with our detailed evaluation using the five‑step model specified in the guidance to determine the impact of the new standard 

 

as allowed for under asu 201409 we will apply the guidance using the modified retrospective transition method whereby we will recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings deficit based on our analysis the adoption of asu 201409 will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations our adoption will result in balance sheet reclassifications for recording our estimate for customer returns historically our deferred revenue liability for customer returns has not been material asu 201409 requires the recognition of a current liability for the gross amount of the estimated returns and a current asset for the cost of the related products each less than 10 million at december 31 2017 

we have determined that the adoption will not require material or significant changes to our internal controls over financial reporting 

the following table summarizes the remaining recent accounting pronouncements that we plan to adopt in future periods 



results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2017  2016  and 2015  we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



 

when calculating our base business results we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2017  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 8  compared to 2016  despite one less selling day our 7  increase in base business sales generated much of this growth we experienced modestly favorable weather during the swimming pool season which ended with severe storms in september and october in both texas and florida by the end of the fourth quarter we mostly recovered sales lost over these time periods 

the following factors benefited our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings such as building materials and equipment evidence increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas including pool construction pool remodeling as well as equipment upgrades in 2017 sales for equipment such as swimming pool heaters pumps and lights increased 10  and collectively represented approximately 23  of net sales this increase reflects both the growth of replacement activity and continued demand for higher‑priced more energyefficient products sales of building materials which includes tile grew 13  compared to 2016  and represented approximately 10  of net sales in 2017  

sales to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities are included in the appropriate existing product categories and growth in this area is reflected in the numbers above these sales increased 10  compared to 2016  and represented 5  of our consolidated net sales for 2017 excluding the recent acquisition of lincoln aquatics 

in terms of quarterly performance base business sales increased 5 in the first quarter of 2017  despite a 2 decline in sales related to customer early buy purchases base business sales then increased 7 in the second quarter of 2017  under overall neutral weather conditions for most of the quarter despite the severe weather events in the third quarter of 2017  and one less selling day compared to the same period in 2016  base business sales increased 6 in the third quarter for our seasonally slowest fourth quarter base business sales increased 13  in 2017  reflecting strong consumer demand excellent execution by our team the recovery following hurricane irma and overall favorable weather conditions see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  below 

gross profit 



gross margin for 2017  increased 10 basis points compared to 2016  mostly reflecting product mix coupled with benefits from sourcing initiatives 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 7  compared to 2016  with base business operating expenses up 5  the increase in base business operating expenses was primarily due to higher growthdriven labor and freight expenses as well as greater facilityrelated expenditures equitybased compensation and technology spending as we continue to invest in our business base business operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 30 basis points over 2016  as we continued to leverage our existing infrastructure 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net increased 07 million  compared to 2016  average outstanding debt was 5040 million for 2017  versus 4246 million for 2016  our 2017  average outstanding debt balance reflects greater borrowings primarily to fund working capital growth our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 27  for 2017  compared to 22  for 2016  

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 290  at december 31 2017  and 385 at december 31 2016  our provision for income taxes for 2017 was positively impacted by both us tax reform and asu 201609 as a result of the recently enacted tax legislation we recorded a provisional tax benefit of 120 million  in the fourth quarter of 2017 which primarily reflects the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability in addition to the impact from tax reform we recorded a 126 million  benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017  related to our adoption of asu 201609 

  

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 29  to 1916 million  in 2017  compared to 1490 million  in 2016  earnings per share increased 30  to 451  per diluted share compared to 347  per diluted share in 2016  excluding the 028  per diluted share impact of tax reform and the 024  per diluted share impact of asu 201609 diluted earnings per share increased 15  over last year

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2016  to the year ended december 31 2015 we excluded acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below 



 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2016  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 9 compared to 2015 with the 7 improvement in base business sales contributing much of this increase strong execution combined with overall favorable weather conditions and generally favorable economic and industry conditions supported our sales growth 

the following factors benefited our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings such as building materials and equipment support our assertion that there continues to be increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas including pool construction pool remodeling as well as equipment upgrades sales of equipment such as swimming pool heaters pumps and lights which represented 8 7 and 7 of our total net sales respectively increased collectively by 9 compared to 2015 this increase reflects both the gradual recovery of replacement activity and increased demand for higherpriced more energyefficient products sales of building materials which includes tile represent just over 9 of net sales for 2016 and grew by 14 compared to 2015 

sales to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities are included in the appropriate existing product categories and growth in this area is reflected in the numbers above these sales represented 4 of our consolidated net sales for 2016 and increased 16 compared to 2015 due primarily to our increased focus on the commercial market as well as greater resources assigned to this area including designated warehouse space increased staffing and additional vendor relationships 

in terms of quarterly performance base business sales increased 13 in the first quarter of 2016 as warmer than normal weather across our seasonal markets kicked off 2016 allowing for accelerated pool openings and increased ability for customers to perform remodel replacement and new construction activity earlier in the year as we have disclosed in recent years 2016 customer early buy shipments again caused some second quarter sales to shift into the first quarter and accounted for approximately 3 of our first quarter 2016 sales growth neutral weather conditions in the second and third quarters coupled with strong execution contributed to our 6 and 5 base business sales growth in the second and third quarter of 2016 respectively for our seasonally slow fourth quarter base business sales increased 5 in 2016 over very strong fourth quarter 2015 results as our sales benefited from warmer than average temperatures during this time period see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  below 

gross profit 



gross margin for 2016 increased approximately 20 basis points over 2015 and benefited from improvements in supply chain management and internal initiatives as well as favorable product mix from pool openings earlier in the year these favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in customer early buy deliveries as these sales include applicable discounts quarterly gross margin comparisons varied throughout the year with an increase of 10 basis points in the first quarter which reflects the impact of customer early buy shipments gross margin increased 40 basis points in both the second and third quarters and increased 20 basis points in the seasonally slower fourth quarter 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 6 compared to 2015 with base business operating expenses up 4 while the increase in total operating expenses includes expenses from our more recent acquisitions the increase in base business operating expenses was due primarily to higher growthdriven labor building rent and freight expenses focusing on efficiencies and leveraging existing infrastructure enabled us to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of sales 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net increased 64 million compared to 2015 this increase includes 35 million related to a nonoperating note receivable the remaining component is primarily interest expense on debt which increased 32 million over last year average outstanding debt was 4246 million for 2016 versus 3792 million for 2015 our 2016 average outstanding debt balance reflects greater share repurchases than in 2015 our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 22 for 2016 compared to 19 for 2015 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 385 at both december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 16 to 1490 million in 2016 compared to 1283 million in 2015 while earnings per share increased 20 to 347 per diluted share compared to 290 per diluted share in 2015 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and irrigation installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2017  we generated approximately 62  of our net sales and 83  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2017  and 2016  we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  



  

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 



weather impacts on fiscal year 2017  to fiscal year 2016  comparisons 

unseasonably mild weather benefited sales in the first quarter of 2017 however while favorable weather trends early in the year normally have a seasonally larger impact the comparison to the first quarter of 2016 was especially tough given the benefit of the warmerthannormal weather across nearly all markets in the united states in the first quarter of 2016 for the first quarter of 2017 texas and surrounding markets experienced record warm temperatures which when coupled with belowaverage precipitation for that area spurred higher sales growth in two of the more seasonal regions where we operate belowaverage temperatures in the north and aboveaverage precipitation in the west negatively impacted our first quarter 2017 sales growth 

cold and wet weather throughout the midsouth and north impacted those seasonal markets in the middle of the second quarter of 2017 while the weather impact overall for the quarter was fairly neutral temperatures and precipitation throughout most areas other than those described above were normal with only texas benefiting from drier weather in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the aboveaverage rainfall experienced in the same period of 2016 

severe storms in the third quarter of 2017 particularly hurricanes irma and harvey hindered our sales growth in florida and texas although texas largely recovered by the end of september in the central and midwest temperatures were normal for the third quarter contrasting with the aboveaverage temperatures in the third quarter of 2016 the west experienced record heat and normal rainfall in the third quarter of 2017 similar to the aboveaverage heat in the same period of 2016 overall the united states experienced favorable weather in most of the fourth quarter of 2017 particularly florida which allowed for sales recovery following hurricane irma 

weather impacts on fiscal year 2016  to fiscal year 2015  comparisons 

warmerthannormal weather across nearly all markets in the united states benefited our first quarter of 2016 sales growth warmer weather early in the season accelerates pool openings and allows for increased purchases of chemicals and maintenance supplies for existing pools by comparison our yearround markets experienced similar favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2015 while our seasonal markets particularly in the northeast united states and eastern canada experienced coolerthan‑normal temperatures the unusually early warm weather in the first quarter of 2016 in our seasonal markets benefited our first quarter sales growth in our california markets in the first quarter of 2016 was impacted by unfavorable weather comparisons to the same period of 2015 due to higher winter precipitation and average temperatures in 2016 versus record warm temperatures in 2015 

in the second quarter of 2016 the midwest and northeast experienced more favorable conditions compared to 2015 with above‑average temperatures and much drier weather in june 2016 compared to june 2015 although t he extreme rainfall experienced in texas and adjacent states was not as prevalent in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 texas experienced above‑average precipitation again in 2016 florida and the southeast experienced cooler temperatures compared to aboveaverage and record heat in certain areas in 2015 california and the northwest experienced warm temperatures and normal levels of precipitation in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 

weather conditions in the third quarter of 2016 varied throughout the united states creating a neutral overall impact on our results the eastern half of the country experienced aboveaverage temperatures including record high temperatures in the northeast and parts of the midwest the western half of the united states experienced mostly normal temperatures while texas experienced aboveaverage precipitation the conditions in texas in the third quarter of 2016 were in direct contrast to the weather in the same period of 2015 when texas was drying out from heavy precipitation lifting third quarter 2015 sales california and the northwest logged drierthannormal conditions in the third quarter of 2016 compared to average precipitation in 2015 most of the united states experienced warm temperatures during the fourth quarter of 2016 allowing projects to continue through the remainder of the year and contributing to sales growth over the same period in 2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent capital structure including a modest amount of debt and returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

capital expenditures were 14 of net sales in 2017  as we expanded facilities and purchased delivery vehicles to address growth opportunities capital expenditures were 14 of net sales in 2016  and 10 of net sales in 2015  over the last 5 years capital expenditures have averaged roughly 10 of net sales going forward we project capital expenditures will approximate this average 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations of  1753 million  for 2017  increased compared to 2016   primarily due to the increase in net income partially offset by changes in working capital excluding the net income benefit from tax changes cash provided by operations approximates net income for 2017 the timing of our early buy inventory purchases can create fluctuations in inventory and accounts payable balances from year to year a change in the timing of one of our inventory early buy programs in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted in higher inventory but lower accounts payable balances at year end resulting in a negative impact to our 2017 operating cash flows 

in 2016  cash provided by operations improved compared to 2015  primarily due to our net income growth 

cash used in investing activities decreased in 2017  due to a decrease of 69 million   in payments for acquisitions compared to 2016 this was offset by a n additional 50 million  of net capital expenditures in 2017  compared to 2016  to fund our continued investment in new vehicles equipment and technology related to the increase from 2015 to 2016 our   2016   cash used in investing activities reflects   197 million  in net payments to fund acquisitions compared to 45 million  in net payments to fund acquisitions in 2015  

cash used in financing activities increased in 2017  primarily due to lower net borrowings on our debt arrangements we had 821 million  of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2017  compared to 1094 million  in 2016  primarily as a result of lower share repurchases we repurchased 1432 million of shares in the open market in 2017  compared to 1756 million in 2016  in 2015  we had net proceeds from our debt arrangements of 89 million  while we repurchased 924 million of shares in the open market 

future sources and uses of cash 

to supplement cash from operations as our primary source of working capital we will continue to utilize our two major credit facilities which are the amended and restated revolving credit facility the credit facility and the receivables securitization facility the receivables facility for additional details regarding these facilities see note 5 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

revolving credit facility 

on september 29 2017 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility the credit facility provides for 7500 million  in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million  to a total of 8250 million  the credit facility matures on september 29 2022  we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2017  there was 4104 million  outstanding a 42 million  standby letter of credit outstanding and 3354 million  available for borrowing under the credit facility we utilize interest rate swap contracts and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on the credit facility as of december 31 2017  we have three interest rate swap contracts in place that became effective on october 19 2016  these swap contracts were previously forwardstarting and were amended in october 2015 to bring the fixed rates per our forwardstarting contracts in line with current market rates and extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility now effective these amended swap contracts convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 2273 on a notional amount of 750 million and 2111 on two separate notional amounts one 250 million and the other 500 million totaling 750 million interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swap contracts is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility these interest rate swap contracts will terminate on november 20 2019 

in july 2016 we entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap contract to extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility to its maturity date at that time this swap contract will convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 11425 on a notional amount of 1500 million the contract becomes effective on november 20 2019 and terminates on november 20 2020 

the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2017  was approximately 29  excluding commitment fees 

financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2017  the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 

the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends additionally we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50 limit described above so long as i the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50 limit and ii our average total leverage ratio is less than 300 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice 

under the credit facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

receivables securitization facility 

as amended on november 28 2017 our twoyear receivables facility offers us a lower cost form of financing with a peak funding capacity of up to 2550 million  between may 1 and june 30 which includes an additional seasonal funding capacity that is available between march 1 and july 31 other funding capacities range from 800 million  to 2200 million  throughout the remaining months of the year 

the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary the securitization subsidiary the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds limited to the applicable funding capacities upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due 

the receivables facility contains terms and conditions including representations covenants and conditions precedent customary for transactions of this type additionally an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio average total funded debtebitda of 325 to 100 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio ebitdarcash interest expense plus rental expense of 225 to 100 

at december 31 2017  there was 1000 million  outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 23  excluding commitment fees 

as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements under our credit facility and our receivables facility we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2018  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 21 2018  534 million  of the current board authorized amount under our authorized share repurchase plan remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2017  our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 



for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments in thousands related to our longterm debt obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2017  outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2017  for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swap contracts to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility and the receivables facility for certain of our contractual obligations such as unrecognized tax benefits uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time as such we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table see note 7 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for more information related to our unrecognized tax benefits 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2017  there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts for the credit facility the portions of our outstanding balances under the credit facility and the receivables facility that were not covered by our interest rate swap contracts were both subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2017  related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under the credit facility excluding the accordion feature and the offseason maximum amount available under the receivables facility in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility and the receivables facility increased by 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 75 million  and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 013  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2017  the maximum amount available under the credit facility is 7500 million  excluding the 750 million  accordion feature and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility is 2150 million  excluding the 400 million  seasonal increase in capacity available from march 1 to july 31 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom belgium croatia france germany italy portugal spain mexico colombia and australia based on the functional currencies for these international subsidiaries as shown in the table below changes in exchange rates for these currencies may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 9  of total net sales in 2017  our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2018  and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us  or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2016  we operated 344  sales centers in north america europe south america and australia through our four distribution networks 

 

beginning in 2014 we identified npt as a separate distribution network through this network we sell specialized products under the npt brand including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes as well as hardscape and natural stone products please refer to our “business strategy and growth”   section below for more detailed information regarding the development of our npt distribution network 

superior and horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of scp which is wholly owned by pool corporation 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 80 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 11  currently have a pool significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools technological advancements and the development of energyefficient products the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize longterm growth rates similar to the pool industry as irrigation system installations and landscaping often occur in tandem with new singlefamily home construction we believe the continued trend in increased housing starts also offers significant opportunities for the irrigation and landscape industry 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

 

approximately 60  of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenancerelated goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic along with relatively consistent inflationary price increases of 1 to 2 on average passed on by manufacturers and distributors has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2014 pk data inc reports 

  

the replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 30 of consumer spending in the pool industry the activity in this market which includes major swimming pool remodeling is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of the remaining consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and landscape products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market irrigation activities account for approximately 50  of total spending in the irrigation industry with the remaining 50  of spending related to power equipment landscape and specialty outdoor products and accessories as such our irrigation business is more heavily weighted toward new home construction activities compared to our pool business over the last five years our irrigation and landscape business has benefited from the continued slow recovery of singlefamily home construction as irrigation system installations and landscaping projects typically correlate with but lag new home construction 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments and equipment replacement we believe that over the long term singlefamily housing turnover and home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and employment 

while we estimate that new pool construction has increased to approximately 65000  70000  new units in 2016  from the historically low levels experienced during the economic downturn construction levels are still down approximately 65   70  compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 55   60  from what we consider normal levels 

over the past five years the pool industry has continued to show signs of recovery mostly due to the gradual improvement in remodeling and replacement activity our consistent base business sales growth reflects increased consumer discretionary spending and higher replacement activities improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence employment housing access to consumer credit and economic expansion largely support our base business growth over the last five years we estimate the pool industry grew from 2  to 4  per year with favorable weather accelerating growth in any given year and unfavorable weather impeding growth in 2015  specifically excessive precipitation impacted our industry in the second quarter however a mild fall and delayed winter alleviated any contraction in industry growth rates in 2016  an earlier start to the pool season due to warmer than usual temperatures and overall favorable weather throughout the rest of the year benefited the industry as a whole 

we believe there is potential for continued sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity over the next several years and our expectation is that new pool and irrigation construction levels will gradually normalize additionally we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential investment especially in outdoor lifestyle products we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 3 to 6  over this time period as economic trends indicate that consumer spending has been slowly recovering and that residential construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can accelerate or delay the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets in the united states and canada weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are as follows 

 

we promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives including social media we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design product merchandising business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes in addition to these programs we feature consumer showrooms in over 80 of our sales centers and host our annual retail summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry we also act as a day to day resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management other key internal growth initiatives include the continued expansion of both our product offerings as described in the “customers and products” section below and our distribution networks 

with our 2008 acquisition of national pool tile group inc we added a market leading brand of pool tile and composite pool finish products and gained a position in a wider market to increase operating efficiency and improve market reach we have consolidated and repositioned npt standalone sales centers and established npt showrooms within certain existing sales centers in addition to our 17  standalone npt sales centers we currently have over 80 scp and superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where landscape and swimming pool contractors as well as homeowners can view and select pool components including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades and serve as stocking locations for our npt branded products 

we feel the growth opportunities for the npt network closely align with those of our other networks as we see continued opportunity to expand under the npt brand we also expect potential expansion of the network by broadening our product range and sourcing capabilities as more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand while leveraging our existing pool and irrigationlandscape customer base we feel the development of our npt network is a natural extension of our distribution model while we are currently enjoying an expanding economy and improving housing market which help fuel demand for these products this business is more sensitive to these external market factors compared to our business overall 

we have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers given the more stabilized external environment we have increased our focus on new sales center openings complemented by strategic acquisitions and consolidations depending on our market presence since the beginning of 2014  we have opened 13  new sales centers with 6  new sales centers in 2016  we expect to open between 6  and 8  new sales centers in 2017  since the beginning of 2014  we have completed 8  acquisitions consisting of 21  sales centers net of sales center consolidations within one year of acquisition the acquired locations in 2016  include 8  sales centers added to our horizon network our locations that were consolidated in 2016 include 3 sales centers from our scp network 2 from our horizon network and 1 from our spp network which represents a location that was acquired in 2015 and consolidated within one year of acquisition we plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past 10 years we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases we estimate that annual price inflation between 2014  and 2016  was consistent with the tenyear average we anticipate price inflation will vary some by product lines but will approximate the tenyear average overall in 2017  

customers and products 

we serve over 100000  customers in 2016  sales to our largest 100 customers collectively accounted for just under 10 of our total sales we estimate that sales to our largest 1000 customers represented approximately 25 of our total sales in 2016  notably 98 of our customers are small familyowned businesses with relatively limited capital resources these core customers generated a large majority of our sales in 2016  most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors employing no more than ten employees in many cases working alone or with a limited crew these customers also buy from other distributors mass merchants home stores and specialty and internet retailers 

we sell our products primarily to the following types of customers 

 

we conduct our operations through 344  sales centers in north america europe south america and australia our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california texas florida and arizona collectively representing approximately 52  of our 2016  net sales in 2016  we generated approximately 95 of our sales in north america 5 in europe and less than 1 in south america and australia combined references to product line and product category data throughout this form 10k generally reflect data related to the north american swimming pool market as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations 

we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 160000  manufacturer and pool corporation branded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry the types of products we sell are as follows 

  

 

we currently have over 500  product lines and over 50 product categories based on our 2016  product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 13  in 2016  2015  and 2014  in 2016  and 2015  chemical sales increased by 6 and 5 respectively with little benefit from pricing inflation no other product category accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

our maintenance repair and replacement products are generally described as follows 

 

in 2016  the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for approximately 60 of our sales and gross profits while approximately 40 of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools as recently as five years ago sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction this trend reflects a shift back toward a greater percentage of our sales coming from major refurbishment and replacement products due to an ongoing recovery of these activities since levels reached their historic low point in 2009 

discretionary demand for products related to pool construction and remodeling has been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth we have realized sales growth over the past five years due to our ongoing expansion of these product offerings and the steady improvement in new construction remodeling and economic trends however new pool construction remains approximately 65   70  below peak historic levels and approximately 55   60  below what we believe to be normal levels we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets we then evaluate the performance in these test markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

in recent years we have experienced product and customer mix changes including a shift in consumer spending to higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps high efficiency heaters led lighting and irrigation and landscape equipment which positively contribute to our sales and gross profit growth but negatively impact our gross margin we expect continued demand for these products but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives and our expansion of building materials product offerings will help offset these gross margin declines and lead to somewhat flat gross margin trends over the next few years 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network and tile decking materials and interior pool finish products through our npt network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool market primarily for two reasons 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixed‑use zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions for additional information regarding our inventory management see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates  inventory obsolescence” of this form 10k 

we also operate four  centralized shipping locations csls that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool corporation these terms typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20  10  and 8  respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2016  

competition 

we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products based on industry knowledge and available data and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of irrigation and landscape products we also face competition both directly and indirectly from massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers both storebased and internet who buy directly from manufacturers 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of california texas florida and arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3900  people at december 31 2016  given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200  to 500  employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forward‑looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of earnings and other financial performance measures statements of management’s expectations regarding our plans and objectives and industry general economic and other forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” “should” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

consumer discretionary spending affects our sales and is impacted by factors outside of our control including general economic conditions disposable income levels consumer confidence and access to credit in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products may decline often corresponding with declines in discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction maintenance products and repair and certain replacement equipment which are required to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for approximately 90 of net sales and gross profits related to our swimming pool business however the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbish activity even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pools and irrigation systems between late 2006 and early 2010 the unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems although we have seen improvement since 2010 tightening consumer credit could cause consumers to not be able to obtain financing for pool irrigation and related outdoor projects which could negatively impact our sales of constructionrelated products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as irrigation installations and landscape maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions which could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations and negatively impact our sales for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however any failure to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20  10  and 8  respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2016  a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers could also adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

within our industry we directly compete against various regional and local distributors and indirectly against mass market retailers large pool or landscape supply retailers and internet retailers as they compete against our customers for the business of pool owners and other enduse customers outside of our industry we compete indirectly with alternative suppliers of big ticket consumer discretionary products such as boat and motor home distributors and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry given the density and demand for pool products some geographic markets that we serve also tend to have a higher concentration of competitors than others particularly california texas florida and arizona these states encompass our four largest markets and represented approximately 52  of our net sales in 2016  

more aggressive competition by store and internetbased mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and irrigation and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should store and internetbased mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or irrigation and landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and irrigation and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel this includes succession planning related to our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through organic market share gains new sales center openings and acquisitions that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since the beginning of 2014  we have opened 13 new sales centers net of sales center consolidations and we have completed 8 acquisitions consisting of 21  sales centers net of sales center consolidations within one year of acquisition while we contemplate continued growth through internal expansion and acquisitions no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2016  we generated approximately 63  of our net sales and 85  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of both swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and landscape installations and maintenance our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state local and international environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

management has processes in place to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements however failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to regulatory matters in amounts that may be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 

the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulations is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemicals increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustibles and oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations which accounted for 8  of our total net sales in 2016  expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

for foreign sourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products and there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

we depend on a global network of suppliers to source our products product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our sales and expose us to legal claims 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell and distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation and psl branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase the risk of claims may also be greater with respect to products manufactured by thirdparty suppliers outside the united states particularly in china uncertainties with respect to foreign legal systems may adversely affect us in resolving claims arising from our foreign sourced products even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and our company 

we rely on information technology systems to support our business operations any disturbance or breach of our technological infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally failure to maintain the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

information technology supports several aspects of our business   including among others product sourcing pricing customer service transaction processing financial reporting collections and cost management our ability to operate effectively on a day to day basis depends on a solid technological infrastructure which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats we are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunication failures internet failures security breaches and other catastrophic events exposure to various types of cyberattacks such as malware computer viruses worms or other malicious acts as well as human error could also potentially disrupt our operations or result in a significant interruption in the delivery of our goods and services advances in computer and software capabilities encryption technology and other discoveries increase the complexity of our technological environment including how each interact with our various software platforms and may delay or hinder our ability to process transactions and compromise the integrity of our data 

we have designed numerous procedures and protocols to mitigate cybersecurity risks we continually invest in information technology security and update our business continuity plan however the failure to maintain security over and prevent unauthorized access to our data our customers’ personal information including credit card information or data belonging to our suppliers could put us at a competitive disadvantage result in damage to our reputation and subject us to potential litigation liability fines and penalties resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

as of december 31 2016  we had 10  leases with remaining terms longer than seven  years that expire between 2024  and 2027  most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000  square feet to 60000  square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls range in size from approximately 103000  square feet to 185000  square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for a discussion of our base business calculations see the results of operations section below 

2016  financial overview 

financial results 

2016   proved to be a year of excellent results we attribute solid sales growth and even stronger profit growth to a combination of favorable weather and strong execution 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2016   in creased 9  compared to 2015  base business sales of 7  accounted for much of this increase warmer than average temperatures especially in the beginning and end of the year lengthened the 2016 season and benefited sales sales were also bolstered by growth in pool remodeling equipment replacement commercial products and swimming pool construction 

  

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2016   in creased 10  over 2015  gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin grew 20 basis points to 288  for 2016  compared to 286  in 2015 gross margin for the year benefited from continued improvements in supply chain management and disciplined execution 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses for 2016   in creased 6  from 2015  with base business operating expenses up approximately 4 over last year the increase in base business operating expenses was primarily due to higher growthdriven labor costs building rent and freight 

operating income for the year improved 18  over 2015  operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin increased to 100  in 2016  compared to 91  in 2015  

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 16  compared to 2015  while earnings per share was up 20  to 347  per diluted share 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations was  1654 million  in 2016  and exceeded net income by  168 million  combined with 1094 million  in net proceeds from borrowings cash from operating activities helped fund the following initiatives 

 

total net receivables including pledged receivables in creased 6  compared to december 31 2015  consistent with sales growth our allowance for doubtful accounts was 41 million  at december 31 2016  and 42 million  at december 31 2015  

inventory levels grew 2  to 4861 million  at december 31 2016  compared to 4743 million  at december 31 2015  our reserve for inventory obsolescence was 65 million  at december 31 2016  compared to 70 million  at december 31 2015  our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis were 36 times at december 31 2016  and 35  times at december 31 2015  

total debt outstanding of  4380 million  at december 31 2016   in creased 1100 million  or 34  compared to december 31 2015  primarily due to increased share repurchases in 2016  

current trends and outlook 

over the past five years we estimate the pool industry grew from 2  to 4  per year due to the gradual improvement in remodeling and replacement activity improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence employment housing consumer financing and economic expansion largely support our base business growth we feel these positive external trends have promoted increased consumer spending on higher value products that enhance swimming pools and outdoor living spaces our consistent base business sales growth reflects industry growth plus market share gains from existing customers expanding their businesses and our success in newer market initiatives such as hardscapes and commercial pools 

while we estimate that new pool construction has increased to approximately 65000  70000  new units in 2016  from the historically low levels experienced during the economic downturn construction levels are still down approximately 65   70  compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 55   60  from what we consider normal levels favorable weather plays a role in industry growth by accelerating growth in any given year while unfavorable weather impedes growth in 2015  specifically excessive precipitation impacted our industry in the second quarter however a mild fall and delayed winter alleviated any contraction in industry growth rates in 2016  an earlier start to the pool season due to warmer than usual temperatures and overall favorable weather throughout the rest of the year benefited the industry as a whole 

we believe there is potential for continued sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity over the next several years and our expectation is that the new pool and irrigation construction levels will gradually normalize additionally we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential investment especially in outdoor lifestyle products we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 3 to 6  over this time period as economic trends indicate that consumer spending has been slowly recovering and that residential construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

we established our initial outlook for 2017  based on reasonable expectations of organic market share growth ongoing leverage of infrastructure and continuous process improvements for 2017  we expect the macroeconomic environment in the united states will be quite similar to 2016  we expect to continue to gain market share through our comprehensive service and product offerings which we continually diversify through internal sourcing initiatives and expansion into new markets we also plan to broaden our geographic presence by opening 6  to 8  new sales centers in 2017  and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise 

the following section summarizes our outlook for 2017  

 

we project that 2017  earnings will range from 380 to 400 per diluted share which does not include the expected favorable impact from the adoption of asu 201609 we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2017  and subject to additional authorization by our board of directors we anticipate that we will use 1000 million to 1500 million in cash for share repurchases 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

similar to our business our customers’ businesses are seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging these reserves range from 005 for amounts currently due to up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 007  of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales approximated 007  in 2016  005  in 2015  and 010  in 2014  we expect that writeoffs will range from 005 to 010 of net sales in 2017  

at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend allowance for doubtful accounts balance to i current year writeoffs and ii any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates but conservative overall as 2016  writeoffs came in consistent with our fiveyear average but lower than previous historical trends while we slightly lowered our general reserve percentage to account for declining writeoffs in recent years our overall reserve methodology and process for estimating specific reserves remains unchanged 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2016  pretax income would change by approximately 08 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 001  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2016  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity 

we classify products into 13 classes at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the past 12 months or 36 months for tile and 48 months for parts products all inventory is included in these classes except for special order nonstock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 



there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months’ usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend obsolescence reserve balance to i current year inventory writeoffs and ii the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2016  pretax income would change by approximately 13 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 002  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2016  

vendor programs 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor programs as vendor incentives and accordingly as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time we recognize such incentives as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward the attainment of various levels within certain vendor programs we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates as program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors 

we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase levels in the first quarter of the subsequent year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor credits received to the prior year vendor receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our vendor program estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2016  we have not provided for united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if these earnings are repatriated to the united states in the future or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation 

  

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions historically our foreign locations have not generated adequate earnings to both repatriate to the united states and fund foreign operations those historical and future foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested and be used to support our foreign operations and pay nonus obligations 

we have operations in 39  states 1  united states territory and 11  foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

each year we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns based on this hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate differences between our effective income tax rate and federal and state statutory tax rates are primarily due to valuation allowances recorded for certain of our international subsidiaries with tax losses 

performancebased compensation accrual 

the compensation committee of our board compensation committee annually reviews our compensation structure to oversee management’s implementation of maintaining a program that attracts retains develops and motivates employees without leading to unnecessary risk taking our compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including operating income and diluted earnings per share eps 

we use an annual cash performance award annual bonus to focus corporate behavior on shortterm goals for growth financial performance and other specific financial and business improvement metrics management sets the company’s annual bonus objectives at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year management also establishes specific business improvement objectives for both our operating units and corporate employees the compensation committee approves objectives for bonus plans involving executive management 

we also utilize our mediumterm threeyear strategic plan incentive program spip to provide senior management with an additional cashbased payforperformance award based upon the achievement of specified earnings growth objectives payouts through the spip are based on threeyear compounded annual growth rates cagrs of our diluted eps 

we record annual performancebased compensation accruals based on positive operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives starting in june and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated performancebased compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans if any 

we record spip accruals based on our total expected eps for the current fiscal year and cagr estimates for the succeeding two years we base our current fiscal year estimates on the same assumptions used for our annual bonus calculation and our cagr estimates on historical growth rates and projections for the remainder of the threeyear performance periods 

our quarterly performancebased compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year each year we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year end to determine the accuracy of our performancebased compensation estimates based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our performancebased compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is our largest intangible asset at december 31 2016  our goodwill balance was 1848 million  representing approximately 19  of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units falls below its carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center as of october 1 2016  we had 222  reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the highest goodwill balance was 57 million  and the average goodwill balance was 08 million  in october 2016  2015  and 2014  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level in the third quarter of 2016  we recorded a 06 million goodwill impairment charge related to an atrisk reporting unit in quebec canada we have been monitoring this location’s results which came in below expectations at the end of the 2016 pool season as of december 31 2016  the remaining goodwill balance for this reporting unit was 17 million 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows we project future cash flows using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates operating margins discount rates and multiples these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value estimates we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium our aggregate estimated fair values fell below our market capitalization which we consider to be conservative but reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test to facilitate a sensitivity analysis we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate by 5 to reflect more conservative projected cash flow assumptions a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate our sensitivity analysis generated a fair value estimate significantly below our market capitalization and resulted in the identification of no goodwill impairments and no additional atrisk locations 

  

based on the magnitude of its goodwill balance and the continued economic challenges in italy we currently consider our italy reporting unit as at risk for goodwill impairment our most sensitive estimates pertain to this reporting unit’s product mix and the related impact on our gross margin projections which are incorporated into our discounted cash flow assumptions as of december 31 2016  our atrisk reporting unit in italy had a goodwill balance of 33 million  we also consider our reporting units in quebec canada as at risk for goodwill impairment results in quebec began to fall below expectations in 2013 largely due to its heightened sensitivity to weather and certain execution challenges we cannot be assured of favorable weather conditions in any given year which strongly impact results for our quebec reporting units as of december 31 2016  we have three reporting units in quebec with an aggregate goodwill balance of 26 million  

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting units discussed above impairment charges would decrease operating income negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  asu 201409 the fasb also issued subsequent amendments to asu 201409 to provide clarification on the guidance asu 201409 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 which for us will be in the period beginning january 1 2018 we are continuing to perform our detailed evaluation using a fivestep model specified in the guidance to assess the impacts of the new standard 



practices to determine the transaction price we have reviewed our pricing policies and strategies including marketing loyalty and incentive programs for the purpose of determining whether we have any variable or noncash consideration no material items were noted in addition we will review our current accounting policies related to returns price concessions and volume discounts we will continue our accounting policy election to exclude from revenue all amounts we collect and remit to governmental authorities 

 

we expect to apply the guidance using the cumulativeeffect transition method based on our analysis performed to date we do not expect the adoption of asu 201409 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations but will result in additional disclosures regarding our revenue recognition policies 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 inventory topic 330 simplifying the measurement of inventory  which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation asu 201511 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted we have not elected to early adopt this guidance we do not expect the adoption of asu 201511 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments  which eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurementperiod adjustments retrospectively instead an acquirer will recognize a measurementperiod adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment asu 201516 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted we have not elected to early adopt this guidance we do not expect the adoption of asu 201516 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  which requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than separately presenting net deferred tax assets or liabilities as current or noncurrent also companies will no longer allocate valuation allowances between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets because those allowances also will be classified as noncurrent asu 201517 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted we have not elected to early adopt this guidance we do not expect the adoption of asu 201517 will have an impact on our results of operations but it will change the presentation of our financial position and disclosures related to deferred tax assets and liabilities 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases  which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses in a manner similar to current guidance asu 201602 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 the guidance is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach we are currently evaluating the effect that asu 201602 will have on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which amends several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows this guidance requires all excess tax benefits or deficiencies to be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement and all excess tax benefits to be classified with other income tax cash flows as operating activities this portion of the amendment should be applied prospectively the guidance also changes the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized and the methods available to an entity to estimate the impact of forfeitures related to sharebased awards these two amendment topics should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method and would require recognition of cumulativeeffect adjustments to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted the guidance also classifies cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for taxwithholding purposes as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows this portion of the amendment should be applied retrospectively asu 201609 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period but we are not early adopting this guidance the adoption of this guidance will likely have a material positive impact on our income tax provision net income and operating cash flows in periods in which employees elect to exercise their vested stock options or when restrictions on sharebased awards lapse based on our comparison of our deferred tax assets for sharebased compensation to the current intrinsic value of the underlying awards

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2016  2015  and 2014  we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



 

when calculating our base business results we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2016  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 9  compared to 2015  with the 7  improvement in base business sales contributing much of this increase strong execution combined with overall favorable weather conditions and generally favorable economic and industry conditions supported our sales growth 

the following factors benefited our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings such as building materials and equipment support our assertion that there continues to be increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas including pool construction pool remodeling as well as equipment upgrades sales of equipment such as swimming pool heaters pumps and lights which represented 8 7 and 7 of our total net sales respectively increased collectively by 9 compared to 2015  this increase reflects both the gradual recovery of replacement activity and increased demand for higherpriced more energyefficient products sales of building materials which includes tile represent just over 9 of net sales for 2016  and grew by 14 compared to 2015  

sales to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels universities and community recreational facilities are included in the appropriate existing product categories and growth in this area is reflected in the numbers above these sales represented 4 of our consolidated net sales for 2016 and increased 16 compared to 2015  due primarily to our increased focus on the commercial market as well as greater resources assigned to this area including designated warehouse space increased staffing and additional vendor relationships 

in terms of quarterly performance base business sales increased 13 in the first quarter of 2016  as warmer than normal weather across our seasonal markets kicked off 2016 allowing for accelerated pool openings and increased ability for customers to perform remodel replacement and new construction activity earlier in the year as we have disclosed in recent years 2016  customer early buy shipments again caused some second quarter sales to shift into the first quarter and accounted for approximately 3 of our first quarter 2016 sales growth neutral weather conditions in the second and third quarters coupled with strong execution contributed to our 6 and 5 base business sales growth in the second and third quarter of 2016  respectively for our seasonally slow fourth quarter base business sales increased 5 in 2016  over very strong fourth quarter 2015  results as our sales benefited from warmer than average temperatures during this time period see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  below 

gross profit 



gross margin for 2016  increased approximately 20 basis points over 2015  and benefited from improvements in supply chain management and internal initiatives as well as favorable product mix from pool openings earlier in the year these favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in customer early buy deliveries as these sales include applicable discounts quarterly gross margin comparisons varied throughout the year with an increase of 10 basis points in the first quarter which reflects the impact of customer early buy shipments gross margin increased 40 basis points in both the second and third quarters and increased 20 basis points in the seasonally slower fourth quarter 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 6  compared to 2015  with base business operating expenses up 4 while the increase in total operating expenses includes expenses from our more recent acquisitions the increase in base business operating expenses was due primarily to higher growthdriven labor building rent and freight expenses focusing on efficiencies and leveraging existing infrastructure enabled us to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of sales 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net increased 64 million  compared to 2015  this increase includes 35 million  related to a nonoperating note receivable the remaining component is primarily interest expense on debt which increased 32 million  over last year average outstanding debt was 4246 million for 2016  versus 3792 million for 2015  our 2016 average outstanding debt balance reflects greater share repurchases than in 2015 our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 22  for 2016  compared to 19  for 2015  

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 385  at both december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 16  to 1490 million  in 2016  compared to 1283 million  in 2015  while earnings per share increased 20  to 347  per diluted share compared to 290  per diluted share in 2015  

fiscal year 2015  compared to fiscal year 2014   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



for an explanation of how we calculate base business please refer to the discussion of base business above u nder the heading “fiscal year   2016   compared to fiscal year   2015 ”    

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2014 we excluded acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below 



 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2015  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 5 compared to 2014 including a 5 increase in base business sales the sustained strength of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies adversely impacted our consolidated sales growth rate by close to 2 during 2015 after sales exhibited a strong start in the first quarter adverse weather conditions in the second quarter negatively impacted sales in several important markets weather conditions normalized in the back half of the year extending the season in certain markets and leading to year over year sales growth a continued gradual recovery of demand for discretionary replacement and remodel products and increased market share were the primary contributors to our sales growth in 2015 

the following factors benefited our sales growth in 2015 listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

the following factors adversely impacted our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

sales of building materials grew by 13 compared to 2014 our continued strong growth in building materials primarily reflects market share growth with our expansion of stocking locations and broader product offerings as well as the partial recovery in pool remodeling sales of equipment which includes heaters pumps and filters increased by 9 compared to 2014 chemical sales increased by approximately 5 

in terms of quarterly performance base business sales increased 10 in the first quarter of 2015 similar to 2014 our 2015 customer early buy shipments caused some second quarter sales to shift into the first quarter and accounted for approximately 3 of our first quarter 2015 sales growth as discussed above adverse weather conditions in the second quarter led to flat base business sales growth trends in the second quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 normalized weather trends allowed us to generate 5 base business sales growth in the third quarter of 2015 for our seasonally slow fourth quarter base business sales increased 10 in 2015 as our sales benefited from record warm temperatures during this time period see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  below 

gross profit 



gross margin for 2015 remained consistent with 2014 throughout the year gross margin comparisons varied with a decline of 40 basis points in the first quarter due to the impact of customer early buy shipments gross margin remained flat in the second quarter declined 10 basis points in the third quarter and increased 30 basis points in the fourth quarter 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 1 compared to 2014 increases in performancebased incentive compensation and technology related expenses were offset by tight expense controls lower freight costs and an approximate 2 favorable impact on operating expenses from the stronger us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net increased 8 compared to 2014 the primary component is interest expense on debt which increased 6 over 2014 average outstanding debt was 3792 million for 2015 versus 3429 million for 2014 our weighted average effective interest rate was 19 for both 2015 and 2014 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 385 at december 31 2015 compared to 389 at december 31 2014 the decline in our effective income tax rate was primarily a result of improved performance by our international entities in 2015 

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 16 to 1283 million in 2015 compared to 1107 million in 2014 while earnings per share increased 19 to 290 per diluted share compared to 244 per diluted share in 2014 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2016  we generated approximately 63  of our net sales and 85  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2016  and 2015  we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  



   

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 



weather impacts on fiscal year 2016  to fiscal year 2015  comparisons 

warmer than normal weather across nearly all markets in the united states benefited our first quarter of 2016 sales growth warmer weather early in the season accelerates pool openings and allows for increased purchases of chemicals and maintenance supplies for existing pools by comparison our yearround markets experienced similar favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2015 while our seasonal markets particularly in the northeast united states and eastern canada experienced cooler than normal temperatures the unusually early warm weather in the first quarter of 2016 in our seasonal markets benefited our first quarter sales growth in our california markets in the first quarter of 2016 was impacted by unfavorable weather comparisons to the same period of 2015 due to higher winter precipitation and average temperatures in 2016 versus record warm temperatures in 2015 

in the second quarter of 2016 the midwest and northeast experienced more favorable conditions compared to 2015 with above average temperatures and much drier weather in june 2016 compared to june 2015 although t he extreme rainfall experienced in texas and adjacent states was not as prevalent in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 texas experienced above average precipitation yet another year florida and the southeast experienced cooler temperatures compared to above average and record heat in certain areas in 2015 california and the northwest experienced warm temperatures and normal levels of precipitation in the second quarter of both years 

weather conditions in the third quarter of 2016 varied throughout the united states creating a neutral overall impact on our results the eastern half of the country experienced above average temperatures including record high temperatures in the northeast and parts of the midwest the western half of the united states experienced mostly normal temperatures while texas experienced above average precipitation the conditions in texas in the third quarter of 2016 were in direct contrast to the weather in the same period of 2015 when texas was drying out from heavy precipitation lifting third quarter 2015 sales california and the northwest logged drier than normal conditions in the third quarter of 2016 compared to average precipitation last year most of the united states experienced warm temperatures during the fourth quarter of 2016 allowing projects to continue through the remainder of the year and contributing to sales growth over the prior year 

weather impacts on fiscal year 2015  to fiscal year 2014  comparisons 

in the first quarter of 2015 we benefited from favorable weather in most of our yearround markets which experienced warmer than normal temperatures for this time of year these warmer temperatures contributed to sales growth in maintenance products such as chemicals in these markets our seasonal markets experienced cooler than normal temperatures particularly in the northeast united states and eastern canada which experienced another year of near record cold temperatures and substantial snowfall inhibiting sales growth in these areas after our strong start adverse weather conditions in the second quarter of 2015 negatively impacted sales in several important markets 

the second quarter of 2015 marked the wettest on record for much of texas and oklahoma and reflected significant precipitation for most states in the south and central united states this excessive precipitation significantly impacted our second quarter sales delaying construction projects and reducing spending on related discretionary products cooler than normal temperatures in the midwest and the northeast in june of 2015 coupled with substantial rainfall also delayed pool openings and hampered sales growth in these seasonal markets 

weather conditions improved in the back half of the year as our third quarter 2015 sales benefited from a return to more normalized weather the warmer than average temperatures and drier than normal conditions experienced throughout much of the united states later in the third quarter contributed to our sales growth a mild september in the northeast which continued well into the fourth quarter of 2015 also extended the season in these markets as reflected in our fourth quarter of 2015 sales growth most areas east of the mississippi river experienced the warmest temperatures on record through november and december 

our largest yearround markets experienced quite different weather conditions in 2014 as temperatures in florida were normal to above average and the west experienced warmer than average to record high temperatures almost all year especially california and arizona however severe drought conditions persisted in parts of california and arizona through the second quarter of 2014 which limited second quarter sales growth in these markets temperatures and rainfall were closer to normal in texas and the southeast united states during the second quarter which provided some relief from the difficult conditions we faced in other areas despite rainfall during the third and fourth quarters of 2014 severe drought conditions continued to afflict california drought conditions also developed in texas while the southwest accumulated significant rainfall during the third quarter of 2014 in our seasonally slow fourth quarter temperatures and precipitation levels ranged from normal to above average for most of the united states 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent debt structure and returning money to our shareholders our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

over the last five years capital expenditures have averaged roughly 10 of net sales capital expenditures were 14 of net sales in 2016  10 of net sales in 2015  and 08 of net sales in 2014  going forward we project capital expenditures will be 10 to 15 of net sales as we expand facilities and purchase delivery vehicles to address growth opportunities 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations of  1654 million  in 2016  exceeded net income by  168 million  compared to 2015  cash provided by operations increased primarily due to higher net income in 2015  cash provided by operations exceeded net income by 178 million and improved compared to 2014  due to our net income growth and working capital management 

cash used in investing activities increased in 2016 due to an increase of 152 million   in payments for acquisitions compared to 2015 our   2015   cash used in investing activities reflects   45 million  in net payments to fund three acquisitions our 2014  cash used in investing activities includes 106 million  in net payments to fund four acquisitions an additional 53 million  of net capital expenditures in 2016  compared to 2015  funded our continued investment in new vehicles equipment and technology cash used in investing activities for 2016  also includes 16 million  in net payments to fund a revolving note under a credit agreement which we entered into as a lender in 2015 for additional information regarding the revolving note see note 1 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

cash used in financing activities decreased in 2016  primarily due to higher net borrowings on our debt arrangements we had 1094 million  of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2016  compared to 89 million  in 2015  we repurchased 1756 million of shares in the open market in 2016  up 832 million compared to 2015  cash used in financing activities in 2015  increased over 2014 reflecting lower net borrowings on our debt arrangements due to the increase in cash provided by operating activities and the decrease in share repurchases compared to 2014 we had net proceeds from our debt arrangements of 734 million  in 2014  while we repurchased 1323 million of shares in the open market 

future sources and uses of cash 

to supplement cash from operations as our primary source of working capital we will continue to utilize our two major credit facilities our revolving credit facility the credit facility and our receivables securitization facility the receivables facility for additional details regarding these facilities see note 5 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

revolving credit facility 

our credit facility provides for 4650 million in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 5400 million the credit facility matures on november 20 2020 we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2016  there was 3545 million  outstanding and 1105 million  available for borrowing subject to a 40 million standby letter of credit outstanding under the credit facility we utilize interest rate swap contracts and forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on the credit facility in 2016 we had five interest rate swap contracts in place that terminated on october 19 2016 we currently have three interest rate swap contracts that became effective on october 19 2016 these swap contracts were previously forwardstarting and were amended in october 2015 to bring the fixed rates per the contracts in line with current market rates and extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility now effective these amended swap contracts convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 2273 on a notional amount of 750 million and 2111 on two separate notional amounts one 250 million and the other 500 million totaling 750 million interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swap contracts is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility these interest rate swap contracts will terminate on november 20 2019 

in july 2016 we entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap contract to extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility to its maturity date this swap contract will convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 11425 on a notional amount of 1500 million the contract becomes effective on november 20 2019 and terminates on november 20 2020 

the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2016  was approximately 26  excluding commitment fees 

financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2016  the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 

the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends additionally we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50 limit described above so long as i the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50 limit and ii our average total leverage ratio is less than 300 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice 

under the credit facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in penalty payments higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

receivables securitization facility 

as amended on october 28 2016 our twoyear receivables facility offers us a lower cost form of financing with a peak funding capacity of up to 2200 million  between may 1 and june 30 which includes an additional seasonal funding capacity that is available between march 1 and july 31 other funding capacities range from 650 million  to 1500 million  throughout the remaining months of the year 

the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary the securitization subsidiary the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds limited to the applicable funding capacities upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due 

the receivables facility contains terms and conditions including representations covenants and conditions precedent customary for transactions of this type additionally an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio average total funded debtebitda of 325 to 100 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio ebitdarcash interest expense plus rental expense of 225 to 100 

at december 31 2016  there was 835 million  outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 15  excluding commitment fees 

as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2017  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 20 2017  466 million  of the current board authorized amount under our authorized share repurchase plan remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2016  our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 



for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments in thousands related to our longterm debt obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2016  outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2016  for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swap contracts to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility and the receivables facility for certain of our contractual obligations such as unrecognized tax benefits uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time as such we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table see note 7 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for more information related to our unrecognized tax benefits 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2016  there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts for the credit facility the portions of our outstanding balances under the credit facility and the receivables facility that were not covered by our interest rate swap contracts were both subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2016  related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under the credit facility excluding the accordion feature and the offseason maximum amount available under the receivables facility in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility and the receivables facility increased by 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 44 million  and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 006  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2016  the maximum amount available under the credit facility is 4650 million  excluding the 750 million  accordion feature and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility is 1800 million  excluding the 400 million  seasonal increase in capacity available from march 1 to july 31 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom belgium france germany italy portugal spain mexico colombia and australia based on the functional currencies for these international subsidiaries as shown in the table below changes in exchange rates for these currencies may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 8  of total net sales in 2016  our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2017  and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us  or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2015  we operated 336  sales centers in north america europe south america and australia through our four distribution networks 

 

beginning in 2014 we identified npt as a separate distribution network through this network we sell specialized products under the npt brand including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes as well as hardscape and natural stone products please refer to our “business strategy and growth”   section below for more detailed information regarding the development of our npt distribution network 

superior and horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of scp which is wholly owned by pool corporation 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 80 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 11  currently have a pool significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools technological advancements and the development of energyefficient products the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize longterm growth rates similar to the pool industry as irrigation system installations and landscaping often occur in tandem with new singlefamily home construction we believe the continued recovery in the housing industry also offers significant opportunities for the irrigation and landscape industry 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

 

approximately 60  of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenancerelated goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic along with relatively consistent inflationary price increases of 1 to 2 on average passed on by manufacturers and distributors has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following tables reflect growth in the domestic installed base of inground and aboveground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2014 pk data inc reports 

  

the replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 30 of consumer spending in the pool industry the activity in this market which includes major swimming pool remodeling is based on the aging of the installed base of pools the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of the remaining consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and landscape products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market irrigation and landscape maintenance activities account for approximately 40  of total spending in the irrigation industry with the remaining 60  of spending related to irrigation construction and other discretionary related products as such our irrigation business is more heavily weighted toward new construction activities and the sale of discretionary related products compared to our pool business and is therefore more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending our irrigation and landscape business has recently benefited from the continued recovery of singlefamily home construction as irrigation system installations and landscaping projects typically correlate with but lag new home construction 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments and equipment replacement we believe that over the long term housing turnover and single‑family home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and employment 

the economic downturn between 2007 and 2009 had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000  new units in 2009 to approximately 65000  new units in 2015  construction levels are still down approximately 70  compared to peak levels in 2005 and down approximately 60  from what we consider normal levels 

over the past five years the pool industry has continued to show signs of recovery mostly due to the gradual improvement in remodeling and replacement activity the rebound in our base business sales growth since 2010 reflects increased consumer discretionary spending and higher replacement activities improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence employment housing access to consumer credit and economic expansion largely supports our base business growth for each year from 2010 to 2015  we estimate the industry grew from 3  to 4  with the exception of 2013 when we believe industry growth dipped temporarily to approximately 1  to 2  primarily due to the impact of adverse weather on seasonal markets while unseasonably cool temperatures impacted the industry in 2014  the impact was not quite as widespread nor as severe in 2015  excessive precipitation impacted our industry in the second quarter however a mild fall and delayed winter alleviated any contraction in industry growth rates 

going forward we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity and our expectation for new pool and irrigation construction levels to gradually normalize additionally we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential investment especially in outdoor lifestyle products we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 3 to 6  over this time period as economic trends indicate that consumer spending has been slowly recovering and that residential construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can accelerate or delay the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets in the united states and canada weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are as follows 

 

we promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives including social media we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design product merchandising business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes in addition to these programs we feature consumer showrooms in over 80 of our sales centers and host our annual retail summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry we also act as a day to day resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management other key internal growth initiatives include the continued expansion of both our product offerings as described in the “customers and products” section below and our distribution networks 

beginning in early 2000 we significantly increased the breadth of our product offerings outside our traditional pool distribution business these complementary products included building materials used for pool construction installations and remodeling such as concrete and pool surfacing and decking materials with our march 2008 acquisition of national pool tile group inc we added a market leading brand of pool tile and composite pool finish products and gained a position in a wider market over the last five years to increase operating efficiency we consolidated and repositioned npt standalone sales centers and established npt showcases within certain existing sales centers in addition to our 15  standalone npt sales centers we currently have over 80 scp and superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where swimming pool dealers and homeowners can view and select pool components including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades and serve as stocking locations for our npt branded products 

we feel the growth opportunities for the npt network closely align with those of our other networks as we see continued opportunity to expand under the npt name both organically and through acquisitions we also expect potential expansion of the network by broadening our product range and sourcing capabilities as more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand while leveraging our existing pool and irrigationlandscape customer base we feel the development of our npt network is a natural extension of our distribution model while we are currently enjoying an expanding economy and improving housing market which help fuel demand for these products this business is more sensitive to these external market factors compared to our business overall 

we have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers given the more stabilized external environment we have increased our focus on new sales center openings complemented by strategic acquisitions and consolidations depending on our market presence since the beginning of 2013  we have opened 8  new sales centers net of sales center consolidations with 4  new sales centers in 2015  we expect to open between 5  and 7  new sales centers in 2016  since the beginning of 2013  we have completed 9  acquisitions consisting of 16  sales centers net of sales center consolidations within one year of acquisition the acquired locations in 2015  include 2  sales centers added to our scp network 2  sales centers added to our superior network and 3  sales centers added to our npt network we plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically including the period between 2007 and 2009 when our industry contracted going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past 10 years we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases we estimate that annual price inflation was consistent with the tenyear average between 2013  and 2015  we anticipate price inflation will vary some by product lines but will approximate the tenyear average overall in 2016  

customers and products 

we serve over 100000  customers in 2015  sales to our largest 100 customers collectively accounted for just under 10 of our total sales we estimate that sales to our largest 1000 customers represented approximately 25 of our total sales in 2015  notably 98 of our customers are small familyowned businesses with relatively limited capital resources these core customers generated a large majority of our sales in 2015  most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors employing no more than ten employees in many cases working alone or with a limited crew these customers also buy from other distributors mass merchants home stores and specialty and internet retailers 

we sell our products primarily to the following types of customers 

 

we conduct our operations through 336  sales centers in north america europe south america and australia our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona collectively representing approximately 53  of our 2015  net sales in 2015  we generated approximately 94 of our sales in north america 5 in europe and less than 1 in south america and australia combined 

we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 160000  national brand and pool corporation branded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

  

 

we track and monitor the majority of our sales at the product level to provide support for sales and marketing efforts and for consideration in incentive plan programs we currently have over 500  product lines and over 50 product categories based on our 2015  product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 13  in 2015  13  in 2014  and 14  in 2013  in 2015  and 2014  chemical sales increased by 5 and 3 respectively with little benefit from pricing inflation no other product category accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we categorize our maintenance repair and replacement products into the following two groupings 

 

in 2015  the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for approximately 60 of our sales and gross profits while approximately 40 of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools these components reflect a shift back toward more sales of major refurbishment and replacement products due to an ongoing recovery of these activities since levels reached a low point in 2009 between 2005 and early 2010 sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction prior to this industry downturn just over 50 of our total sales and gross profits were related to maintenance and minor repair products 

discretionary demand for products related to pool construction and remodeling has been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth while sales of these products declined between 2007 and 2009 we realized sales growth from 2010 to 2015 due to our ongoing expansion of these product offerings and the steady improvement in new construction remodeling and economic trends however new pool construction remains approximately 70  below peak levels reached in 2005 and approximately 60  below what we believe to be normal levels we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets we then evaluate the performance in these test markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

in recent years we have experienced product and customer mix changes including a shift in consumer spending to higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps high efficiency heaters led lighting and irrigation and landscape equipment which positively contribute to our sales and gross profit growth but negatively impact our gross margin we expect continued demand for these products but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives and our expansion of building materials and commercial product offerings will help offset these gross margin declines and lead to somewhat flat gross margin trends over the next few years 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network and hardscapes tile decking materials and interior pool finish products through our npt network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool market primarily for two reasons 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixed‑use zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

we also operate four  centralized shipping locations csls that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to offer seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool corporation these terms typically allow us to place orders in the fall prior to any seasonal price increases take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20  10  and 8  respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2015  

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of irrigation and landscape products we also face competition both directly and indirectly from massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers both storebased and internet who buy directly from manufacturers 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of california florida texas and arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3800  people at december 31 2015  given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200  to 500  employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forward‑looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of earnings and other financial performance measures statements of management’s expectations regarding our plans and objectives and industry general economic and other forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” “should” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward‑looking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products has been and may continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

consumer discretionary spending affects our sales and is impacted by factors outside of our control including general economic conditions disposable income levels consumer confidence and access to credit in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products may decline often corresponding with declines in discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction maintenance products and repair and certain replacement equipment which are required to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for approximately 90 of net sales and gross profits related to our swimming pool business however the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbish activity even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pools and irrigation systems between late 2006 and early 2010 the unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems although we have seen improvement since 2010 if these trends worsen many consumers will likely not be able to obtain financing for pool irrigation and related outdoor projects which could negatively impact our sales of constructionrelated products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions which could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations and negatively impact our sales for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 20  10  and 8  respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2015  a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers could also adversely affect our business we dedicate considerable resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe significantly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we directly compete against various regional and local distributors and indirectly against mass market retailers large pool or landscape supply retailers and internet retailers as they compete against our customers for the business of pool owners and other enduse customers outside of our industry we compete indirectly with alternative suppliers of big ticket consumer discretionary products such as boat and motor home distributors and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry given the density and demand for pool products some geographic markets that we serve also tend to have a higher concentration of competitors than others particularly california florida texas and arizona these states encompass our four largest markets and represented approximately 53  of our net sales in 2015  

more aggressive competition by store and internetbased mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should store and internetbased mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel this includes succession planning related to our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through organic market share gains new sales center openings and acquisitions that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since the beginning of 2013  we have opened 8 new sales centers net of sales center consolidations and we have completed 9 acquisitions consisting of 16  sales centers net of sales center consolidations within one year of acquisition while we contemplate continued growth through internal expansion and acquisitions no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2015  we generated approximately 63  of our net sales and 90  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of both swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and landscape installations and maintenance our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state local and international environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

management has processes in place to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements however failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to regulatory matters in amounts that may be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 

the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulations is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations which accounted for 8  of our total net sales in 2015  expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

for foreign sourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products and there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

we depend on a global network of suppliers to source our products product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our sales and expose us to legal claims 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell and distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation and psl branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase the risk of claims may also be greater with respect to products manufactured by thirdparty suppliers outside the united states particularly in china uncertainties with respect to foreign legal systems may adversely affect us in resolving claims arising from our foreign sourced products even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and our company 

we rely on information technology systems to support our business operations any disturbance or breach of our technological infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally failure to maintain the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

information technology supports several aspects of our business   including among others product sourcing pricing customer service transaction processing financial reporting collections and cost management our ability to operate effectively on a day to day basis depends on a solid technological infrastructure which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats we are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunication failures internet failures security breaches and other catastrophic events exposure to various types of cyberattacks such as malware computer viruses worms or other malicious acts as well as human error could also potentially disrupt our operations or result in a significant interruption in the delivery of our goods and services advances in computer and software capabilities encryption technology and other discoveries increase the complexity of our technological environment including how each interact with our various software platforms and may delay or hinder our ability to process transactions and compromise the integrity of our data 

we have designed numerous procedures and protocols to mitigate these risks we continually invest in information technology security and update our business continuity plan however the failure to maintain security over and prevent unauthorized access to our data our customers’ personal information including credit card information or data belonging to our suppliers could put us at a competitive disadvantage result in damage to our reputation and subject us to potential litigation liability fines and penalties resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporation corporate offices which consist of approximately 54800  square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50  ownership interest we own three  sales center facilities in florida and one  in texas we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three  to seven  year terms 

as of december 31 2015  we had 12  leases with remaining terms longer than seven  years that expire between 2023  and 2027  most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000  square feet to 60000  square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls range in size from approximately 103000  square feet to 185000  square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during the year ended december 31 2015

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including product liability personal injury commercial contract and employment matters litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 

as previously disclosed a number of purported antitrust class action suits were filed against us in various united states district courts in 2012 the cases were transferred and consolidated before the judicial panel for multidistrict litigation mdl docket no 2328 and are presently pending in the eastern district of louisiana the plaintiffs include indirect purchaser plaintiffs purporting to represent indirect purchasers of swimming pool products in arizona california florida and missouri and direct purchaser plaintiffs who are current or former customers the plaintiffs also named three additional defendants hayward industries inc pentair water pool and spa inc and zodiac pool systems inc the plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and enhanced damages interest costs and fees and other equitable relief the court gave final approval of a class action settlement between hayward industries inc pentair water pool and spa inc and zodiac pool systems inc and the direct purchaser plaintiffs the court also gave final approval of class action settlements between the indirect purchaser plaintiffs and each of hayward industries inc zodiac pool systems inc and pentair water pool and spa inc on january 27 2016 the court granted summary judgment in our favor on the direct purchasers’ horizontal conspiracy claim we continue to defend ourselves in this matter 

while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable based on currently available facts we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter or other claims and litigation not discussed above will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and related events unfold

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for a discussion of our base business calculations see the results of operations section below 

2015  financial overview 

financial results 

we had a recordsetting year in 2015  topped off with favorable warmer weather in the fourth quarter which contributed to record fourth quarter sales and our first profitable fourth quarter ever we grew annual sales by 5  over 2014 despite an almost 2 negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations strict margin discipline and expense management enabled us to expand our operating margin by more than 70 basis points 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2015   in creased 5  compared to 2014  base business sales also increased 5  annual sales benefited from increased consumer spending on discretionary products particularly related to replacement and remodel activity pool owners are investing to upgrade existing pools and outdoor systems to increase energy efficiency and incorporate more technologically advanced products record warm temperatures through much of the fourth quarter extended the pool season well into november and december in many markets which spurred greater sales in both our building materials and equipment product categories 

  

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2015   in creased 5  over 2014  gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin remained constant at 286  for both 2015  and 2014  

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses for 2015   in creased just 1  from 2014  increases in performancebased incentive compensation and technology related expenses were offset by tight expense controls and an approximate 2 favorable impact on operating expenses from the stronger us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

operating income for the year improved 14  over 2014  operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin increased to 91  in 2015  compared to 84  in 2014  

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 16  compared to 2014  while earnings per share was up 19  to a record 290  per diluted share 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations was  1461 million  in 2015  and exceeded total net income by  178 million  combined with 89 million  in net proceeds from borrowings cash from operating activities helped fund the following initiatives 

 

total net receivables including pledged receivables in creased 11  compared to december 31 2014  indicating our december 2015  sales growth our allowance for doubtful accounts increased 5  compared to december 31 2014  overall we noted lower writeoffs as a percentage of net sales throughout 2015  and a smaller percentage of total receivables being greater than 60 days past due 

inventory levels grew 2  to 4743 million  at december 31 2015  compared to 4670 million  at december 31 2014  our reserve for inventory obsolescence was 70 million  at december 31 2015  compared to 64 million  at december 31 2014  our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis were 35 times at december 31 2015  and 34  times at december 31 2014  

total debt outstanding of  3297 million  at december 31 2015   in creased 89 million  or 3  compared to december 31 2014  

current trends and outlook 

over the past five years the pool industry has continued to show signs of recovery mostly due to the gradual improvement in remodeling and replacement activity the rebound in our base business sales growth since 2010 reflects increased consumer discretionary spending and higher replacement activities improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence employment housing consumer financing and economic expansion largely supports our base business growth we feel these positive external trends have promoted increased consumer spending on products that enhance swimming pools and outdoor living spaces such as building materials and energyefficient equipment 

the economic downturn between 2007 and 2009 had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000  new units in 2009 to approximately 65000  new units in 2015  construction levels are still down approximately 70  compared to peak levels in 2005 and down approximately 60  from what we consider normal levels for each year from 2010 to 2015  we estimate the industry grew from 3  to 4  with the exception of 2013 when we believe industry growth dipped temporarily to approximately 1  to 2  due to the impact of adverse weather on seasonal markets while unseasonably cool temperatures impacted the industry in 2014  the impact was not quite as widespread nor as severe in 2015  excessive precipitation impacted our industry in the second quarter however a mild fall and delayed winter alleviated any contraction in industry growth rates the strengthening of the us dollar against most major currencies also impacted reported results of our industry’s international locations over the past 18 months 

going forward we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity and our expectation for new pool and irrigation construction levels to gradually normalize additionally we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential investment especially in outdoor lifestyle products we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 3 to 6  over this time period as economic trends indicate that consumer spending has been slowly recovering and that residential construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

for 2016  we expect the macroeconomic environment in the united states and the opportunities available to us to grow market share will be quite similar to 2015  we plan to gain market share through our comprehensive product offerings which we continually diversify through both internal sourcing initiatives and by transferring experience for other markets served we also plan to modestly expand our geographic presence by opening 5  to 7  new sales centers in 2016  and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise declining crude oil prices may impact discretionary spending in texas and certain other markets given the importance of the oil and gas industry on employment in these markets however gains from economic stability in our other yearround markets and in our seasonal markets should mitigate the risk of these possible declines assuming normal weather patterns translation of our foreign earnings may also adversely impact our 2016  results but we expect the foreign currency rate declines to be less significant than what occurred in 2015  

the following section summarizes our outlook for 2016  

 

 

based on the factors described above we project that 2016  earnings will range from 320 to 335 per diluted share we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2016  and anticipate that we will use 1000 million to 1500 million in cash for share repurchases 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

similar to our business our customers’ businesses are seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging these reserves range from 005 for amounts currently due to up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 010  of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales approximated 005  in 2015  010  in 2014  and 010  in 2013  we expect that writeoffs will approximate 010 of net sales in 2016  

at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend allowance for doubtful accounts balance to i current year writeoffs and ii any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates but conservative overall based on lower writeoffs in 2015  and improvements in our accounts receivable aging while we slightly lowered our general reserve percentage in 2015  to account for these trends our overall reserve methodology and process for estimating specific reserves remains unchanged 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2015  pretax income would change by approximately 08 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 001  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2015  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity we classify products into 13 classes at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the past 12 months or 36 months for tile and parts products all inventory is included in these classes except for special order nonstock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 



there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months’ usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend obsolescence reserve balance to i current year inventory writeoffs and ii the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2015  pretax income would change by approximately 14 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 002  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2015  

vendor incentives 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor incentives as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors 

we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor incentive arrangements are based on calendar year periods we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase levels in the first quarter of the subsequent year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor incentives received to the prior year vendor incentive balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our vendor incentive estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2015  we have not provided for united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if these earnings are repatriated to the united states in the future or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation 

  

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions historically our foreign locations have not generated adequate earnings to both repatriate to the united states and fund foreign operations those historical and future foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested and be used to support our foreign operations and pay nonus obligations 

we have operations in 39  states 1  united states territory and 11  foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

each year we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns based on this hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate 

incentive compensation accrual 

our incentive compensation structure is designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share 

management sets the objectives for our bonus plans at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record incentive compensation accruals based on positive operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives starting in june and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

our quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year each year we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year end to determine the accuracy of our incentive compensation estimates based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our incentive compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is our largest intangible asset at december 31 2015  our goodwill balance was 1728 million  representing approximately 18  of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units falls below its carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center as of october 1 2015  we had 216  reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the highest goodwill balance was 57 million  and the average goodwill balance was 08 million  in october 2015  2014  and 2013  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows we project future cash flows using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates operating margins discount rates and multiples these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value estimates we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium our aggregate estimated fair values fell below our market capitalization which we consider to be conservative but reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test to facilitate a sensitivity analysis we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate by 5 to reflect more conservative projected cash flow assumptions a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate our sensitivity analysis generated a fair value estimate significantly below our market capitalization and resulted in the identification of no goodwill impairments and no additional atrisk locations 

  

based on the magnitude of its goodwill balance and the continued economic challenges in italy we currently consider our italy reporting unit as at risk for goodwill impairment our most sensitive estimates pertain to this reporting unit’s product mix and the related impact on our gross margin projections which are incorporated into our discounted cash flow assumptions as of december 31 2015  our atrisk reporting unit in italy had a goodwill balance of 34 million  we also consider one reporting unit in quebec canada as at risk for goodwill impairment results for this location began to fall below expectations in 2013 largely due to its heightened sensitivity to weather and certain execution challenges we cannot be assured of favorable weather conditions in any given year which strongly impact this reporting unit’s results as of december 31 2015  our atrisk reporting unit in quebec had a goodwill balance of 22 million  

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting units discussed above impairment charges would decrease operating income negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  asu 201409 which requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers asu 201409 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap the guidance may be applied using either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we are currently evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  which requires entities to present debt issuance costs as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than as an asset amortization of the costs will continue to be recorded as interest expense asu 201503 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 and early adoption is permitted we have not elected to early adopt this guidance and we do not expect the adoption of asu 201503 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 inventory topic 330 simplifying the measurement of inventory  which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation asu 201511 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted we have not elected to early adopt this guidance we do not expect the adoption of asu 201511 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments  which eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurementperiod adjustments retrospectively instead an acquirer will recognize a measurementperiod adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment asu 201516 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted we have not elected to early adopt this guidance we do not expect the adoption of asu 201516 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  which requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than separately presenting net deferred tax assets or liabilities as current or noncurrent also companies will no longer allocate valuation allowances between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets because those allowances also will be classified as noncurrent asu 201517 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted we have not elected to early adopt this guidance we do not expect the adoption of asu 201517 will have an impact on our results of operations but it will change the presentation of our financial position and disclosures related to deferred tax assets and liabilities 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases  which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses in a manner similar to current guidance asu 201602 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018  the guidance is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach we are currently evaluating the effect that asu 201602 will have on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures 

  

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2015  2014  and 2013  we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2015  compared to fiscal year 2014   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



 

when calculating our base business results we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2015  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 5  compared to 2014  including a 5  increase in base business sales the sustained strength of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies adversely impacted our consolidated sales growth rate by close to 2 during 2015  after sales exhibited a strong start in the first quarter adverse weather conditions in the second quarter negatively impacted sales in several important markets weather conditions normalized in the back half of the year extending the season in certain markets and leading to year over year sales growth a continued gradual recovery of demand for discretionary replacement and remodel products and increased market share were the primary contributors to our sales growth in 2015  

the following factors benefited our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

the following factors adversely impacted our sales growth listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

sales of building materials grew by 13 compared to 2014  our continued strong growth in building materials primarily reflects market share growth with our expansion of stocking locations and broader product offerings as well as the partial recovery in pool remodeling sales of equipment which includes heaters pumps and filters increased by 9 compared to 2014  chemical sales increased by approximately 5 

in terms of quarterly performance base business sales increased 10 in the first quarter of 2015  similar to 2014  our 2015  customer early buy shipments caused some second quarter sales to shift into the first quarter and accounted for approximately 3 of our first quarter 2015 sales growth as discussed above adverse weather conditions in the second quarter led to flat base business sales growth trends in the second quarter of 2015  compared to 2014  normalized weather trends allowed us to generate 5 base business sales growth in the third quarter of 2015  for our seasonally slow fourth quarter base business sales increased 10 in 2015  as our sales benefited from record warm temperatures during this time period see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  beginning on page 35 

gross profit 



gross margin for 2015  remained consistent with 2014  throughout the year gross margin comparisons varied with a decline of 40 basis points in the first quarter due to the impact of customer early buy shipments gross margin remained flat in the second quarter declined 10 basis points in the third quarter and increased 30 basis points in the fourth quarter 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 1  compared to 2014  increases in performancebased incentive compensation and technology related expenses were offset by tight expense controls lower freight costs and an approximate 2 favorable impact on operating expenses from the stronger us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net increased 8  compared to 2014  the primary component is interest expense on debt which increased 6 over last year average outstanding debt was 3792 million for 2015  versus 3429 million for 2014  our weighted average effective interest rate was 19  for both 2015  and 2014  

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 385  at december 31 2015  compared to 389  at december 31 2014  the decline in our effective income tax rate is primarily a result of improved performance by our international entities in 2015  

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 16  to 1283 million  in 2015  compared to 1107 million  in 2014  while earnings per share increased 19  to 290  per diluted share compared to 244  per diluted share in 2014  

fiscal year 2014  compared to fiscal year 2013   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



for an explanation of how we calculate base business please refer to the discussion of base business on page 29 u nder the heading “fiscal year   2015   compared to fiscal year   2014 ”    

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2014 to the year ended december 31 2013 we excluded acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below 



 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2014  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 8 in 2014 compared to 2013 including a 7 increase in base business sales after the late start to the 2013 pool season we anticipated a comparative benefit from more favorable weather conditions in 2014 but this expectation did not materialize due to prolonged cold and wet weather in many of our seasonal markets particularly canada and the northern united states as a result the timing of 2014 pool openings in many of those areas was similar to 2013 in 2014 base business sales increased by 5 in our seasonal markets versus 8 in our largest yearround markets compared to 2013 

the overall base business sales increase also reflected the impact of the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

sales of building materials and tile grew by 20 compared to 2013 our continued strong growth in building materials reflected market share growth resulting from our expansion of stocking locations and broader product offerings as well as the partial recovery in pool remodeling sales of equipment which includes heaters pumps lighting and filters increased by approximately 11 compared to 2013 chemical sales increased by 3 while chemical pricing remained relatively flat 

base business sales increased 9 in the first quarter of 2014 approximately 2 of our first quarter sales growth reflected a change in the timing of customer early buy purchases which effectively shifted sales into the first quarter of 2014 that historically have occurred in the second quarter despite not having the expected benefit of a return to normal seasonal weather patterns we realized base business sales growth of 7 and 5 in the second and third quarters of 2014 for our seasonally slow fourth quarter base business sales increased 8 in 2014 as we capitalized on favorable weather conditions during this time period see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  beginning on page 35 

gross profit 



in 2014 gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the previous year we believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives in 2014 as well as higher volume incentives from certain of our vendors contributed to this improvement favorable product mix due to higher building materials sales growth rates and a reduction in equipment sales growth rates compared to 2013 also added some benefit given comparatively lower margins on heaters pumps lighting and filters the unfavorable gross margin impact of first quarter 2014 customer early buy purchases somewhat offset these benefits purchases included in customer early buys are primarily comprised of lower margin discretionary products and include applicable discounts 

year over year gross margin comparisons ranged from mostly flat to slightly improved each quarter during 2014 with a decline of 20 basis points in the first quarter due to the impact of customer early buy purchases described above then improvements of 25 basis points in the second quarter 50 basis points in the third quarter and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter which also reflected some benefit from acquisitions 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 7 in 2014 compared to 2013 with base business operating expenses up 5 the increase in base business operating expenses is primarily attributed to the following listed in order of magnitude with approximate impact 

 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net 

interest and other nonoperating expenses net increased 11 in 2014 compared to 2013 average outstanding debt was 3429 million for 2014 versus 2561 million for 2013 the weighted average effective interest rate declined to 19 in 2014 compared to 24 in 2013 the decrease in our effective interest rate reflected the utilization of available borrowing capacity on our receivables facility at lower interest rates than under our credit facility 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 389 at december 31 2014 consistent with our rate of 388 at december 31 2013 

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 14 to 1107 million in 2014 compared to 973 million in 2013 while earnings per share increased 19 to 244 per diluted share compared to 205 per diluted share in 2013 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2015  we generated approximately 63  of our net sales and 90  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2015  and 2014  we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  



  

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 



weather impacts on fiscal year 2015  to fiscal year 2014  comparisons 

in the first quarter of 2015 we benefited from favorable weather in most of our yearround markets which experienced warmerthannormal temperatures for this time of year these warmer temperatures contributed to sales growth in maintenance products such as chemicals in these markets our seasonal markets experienced cooler than normal temperatures particularly in the northeast united states and eastern canada which experienced another year of near record cold temperatures and substantial snowfall inhibiting sales growth in these areas after our strong start adverse weather conditions in the second quarter negatively impacted sales in several important markets the second quarter of 2015 marked the wettest on record for much of texas and oklahoma and reflected significant precipitation for most states in the south and central united states this excessive precipitation significantly impacted our second quarter sales delaying construction projects and reducing spending on related discretionary products cooler than normal temperatures in the midwest and the northeast in june coupled with substantial rainfall also delayed pool openings and hampered sales growth in these seasonal markets 

weather conditions improved in the back half of the year as our third quarter 2015 sales benefited from a return to more normalized weather the warmer than average temperatures and drier than normal conditions experienced throughout much of the united states later in the third quarter contributed to our sales growth a mild september in the northeast which continued well into the fourth quarter also extended the season in these markets as reflected in our fourth quarter sales growth most areas east of the mississippi river experienced the warmest temperatures on record through november and december 

weather impacts on fiscal year 2014  to fiscal year 2013  comparisons 

after the late start to the 2013 pool season we anticipated a comparative benefit from more favorable weather conditions in 2014 however our seasonal markets experienced cooler than normal temperatures yet another year the northeast parts of the midwest and eastern canada experienced near record cold temperatures and substantial snowfall during the first quarter of 2014 cold and wet weather persisted through april and may of 2014 particularly in canada and the northern united states limiting second quarter sales growth in many of our seasonal markets through may late season snow impacted the rocky mountain region while parts of the midwest felt the impact of muchdelayed thawing from snowfall in the winter and early spring similar conditions continued through the third quarter as parts of the northeast and substantially all of the southeast and central portions of the united states experienced cooler than normal temperatures 

our largest yearround markets experienced quite different weather conditions in 2014 as temperatures in florida were normal to above average and the west experienced warmer than average to record high temperatures almost all year especially california and arizona however severe drought conditions persisted in parts of california and arizona through the second quarter which limited second quarter sales growth in these markets temperatures and rainfall were closer to normal in texas and the southeast united states during the second quarter which provided some relief from the difficult conditions we faced in other areas despite rainfall during the third and fourth quarters severe drought conditions continued to afflict california drought conditions also developed in texas while the southwest accumulated significant rainfall during the third quarter in our seasonally slow fourth quarter temperatures and precipitation levels ranged from normal to above average for most of the united states 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent debt structure and returning money to our shareholders our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

as discussed further under the subheading future sources and uses of cash  on page 38 we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under our debt agreements including the maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio although more conservative than the maximum we strive to maintain an average total leverage ratio of 150 to 200 within the constraints of these metrics we determine the timing and extent to which we will repurchase our common stock under board authorized repurchase programs andor repay our debt 

over the last five years capital expenditures have averaged roughly 10 of net sales capital expenditures were 10 of net sales in 2015  08 of net sales in 2014  and 09 of net sales in 2013  going forward we project capital expenditures will be 10 to 15 of net sales as we expand facilities and purchase delivery vehicles to address growth opportunities 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations of  1461 million  in 2015  exceeded net income by  178 million  compared to 2014  cash provided by operations increased primarily due to higher net income and improvements in the seasonal purchasing and payment cycle in 2014  cash provided by operations exceeded net income by 108 million and improved compared to 2013  due to our net income growth and working capital management 

cash used in investing activities for 2015  includes 43 million  in net payments to fund a revolving note under a credit agreement which we entered into as a lender in 2015  for additional information regarding the revolving note see note 1 of our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k  an additional   118 million   of net capital expenditures in   2015   compared to   2014   funded   our continued investment in new vehicles equipment and technology and was offset by a   62 million   decline in payments for acquisitions our   2014   cash used in investing activities reflects   106 million  in net payments to fund four acquisitions including our acquisition of pool systems pty ltd our 2013  cash used in investing activities mainly reflects ongoing capital expenditures as we acted on limited acquisition opportunities that year 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2015  reflecting lower net borrowings on our debt arrangements due to the increase in cash provided by operating activities and the decrease in share repurchases we had 89 million  of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2015  compared to 734 million  in 2014  while we repurchased 924 million of shares in the open market in 2015  down 400 million compared to 2014  cash used in financing activities declined in 2014  mostly due to increases in our net borrowings partially offset by greater repurchases of our shares in the open market and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock we had 734 million  of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2014  compared to 155 million  in 2013  in 2014  we repurchased 1323 million of shares in the open market up 380 million compared to 2013  

future sources and uses of cash 

as amended on november 20 2014 our credit facility provides for 4650 million  in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 5400 million on november 20 2015 we extended the maturity date of the agreement to november 20 2020  we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2015  there was 2730 million  outstanding and 1880 million  available for borrowing under the credit facility we currently have five interest rate swap contracts in place that reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on the credit facility these swap contracts convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 1185 on notional amounts totaling 500 million 1100 on a notional amount of 500 million 1050 on a notional amount of 250 million and 0990 on a notional amount of 250 million interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swaps is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility all five swap contracts will terminate on october 19 2016 

in may 2014 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to future fluctuations in interest rates on our credit facility in an effort to bring the fixed rates per our forwardstarting contracts in line with current market rates and extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility we amended the terms of the swaps in the fourth quarter of 2015 as amended these new swap contracts will convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 2273 on a notional amount of 750 million and 2111 on notional amounts totaling 750 million each of these forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts becomes effective on october 19 2016 and terminates on november 20 2019 

the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2015  was approximately 20  excluding commitment fees 

financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2015  the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 

the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends additionally we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50 limit described above so long as i the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50 limit and ii our average total leverage ratio is less than 300 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice 

under the credit facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in penalty payments higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

as amended on october 15 2015 our twoyear receivables facility offers us a lower cost form of financing with a peak funding capacity of up to 2000 million  between may 1 and june 30 which includes an additional seasonal funding capacity that is available between march 1 and july 31 other funding capacities range from 550 million  to 1350 million  throughout the remaining months of the year 

the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary the securitization subsidiary the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds limited to the applicable funding capacities upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due 

the receivables facility contains terms and conditions including representations covenants and conditions precedent customary for transactions of this type additionally an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio average total funded debtebitda of 325 to 100 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio ebitdarcash interest expense plus rental expense of 225 to 100 

at december 31 2015  there was 550 million  outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 12  excluding commitment fees 

as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2016  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

on february 25 2016  when 143 million  remained under the may 2015 share repurchase authorization our board authorized an additional 1500 million  under our existing share repurchase program this increased our total authorized amount to 1643 million  we expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2015  our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 



for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments in thousands related to our longterm debt obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2015  outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2015  for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swaps to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility and the receivables facility for certain of our contractual obligations such as unrecognized tax benefits uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time as such we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table see note 7 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for more information related to our unrecognized tax benefits 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2015  there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts for the credit facility the portions of our outstanding balances under the credit facility and the receivables facility that were not covered by our interest rate swap contracts were both subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2015  related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under the credit facility excluding the accordion feature and the offseason maximum amount available under the receivables facility in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility and the receivables facility increased by 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 42 million  and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 006  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2015  the maximum amount available under the credit facility is 4650 million  excluding the 750 million  accordion feature and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility is 2000 million  excluding the 400 million  seasonal increase in capacity available from march to july 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom belgium france germany italy portugal spain mexico colombia and australia based on the functional currencies for these international subsidiaries as shown in the table below changes in exchange rates for these currencies may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results over the past 18 months the us dollar strengthened significantly relative to other foreign currencies in 2015  these foreign exchange rate declines negatively impacted our consolidated sales by almost 2 and positively impacted our consolidated operating expenses by approximately 2 while our international operations accounted for only 8  of total net sales in 2015  our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2016  and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us  or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2014  we operated 328  sales centers in north america europe south america and australia through our four distribution networks 

 

beginning in 2014 we identified npt as a separate distribution network through this network we sell specialized products under the npt brand including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes as well as hardscape and natural stone products please refer to our “business strategy and growth”   section below for more detailed information regarding the development of our npt distribution network 

superior and horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of scp which is wholly owned by pool corporation 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 80 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 12  currently have a pool significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools technological advancements and the development of energyefficient products the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize longterm growth rates similar to the pool industry as irrigation system installations and landscaping often occur in tandem with new singlefamily home construction we believe the continued recovery in the housing industry also offers significant opportunities for the irrigation and landscape industry 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

 

approximately 60  of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance related goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic along with relatively consistent inflationary price increases of 1 to 2 on average passed on by manufacturers and distributors has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following tables reflect growth in the domestic installed base of inground and aboveground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2014 pk data inc reports 

the replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 30 of consumer spending in the pool industry the activity in this market which includes major swimming pool remodeling is based on the aging of the installed base of pools the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of the remaining consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and landscape products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market irrigation and landscape maintenance activities account for approximately 40  of total spending in the irrigation industry with the remaining 60  of spending related to irrigation construction and other discretionary related products as such our irrigation business is more heavily weighted toward new construction activities and the sale of discretionary related products compared to our pool business and is therefore more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending our irrigation and landscape business has recently benefited from the continued recovery of singlefamily home construction as irrigation system installations and landscaping projects typically correlate with but lag new home construction 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments and equipment replacement we believe that over the long term housing turnover and single‑family home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and unemployment 

the economic downturn between 2007 and 2009 had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to a more than 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000  new units in 2009 to approximately 60000  new units in 2014  construction levels are still down more than 70  compared to peak levels in 2005 and down approximately 60 from what we consider normal levels 

the rebound in our base business sales growth began in 2010 and reflects continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures and higher replacement activities largely supported by improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence employment housing consumer financing and economic expansion we estimate the industry grew 3 to 5 each year from 2010 to 2012 in 2013 we estimate industry growth dipped temporarily to approximately 1 to 2 given the impact of adverse weather on seasonal markets and then returned to 3 to 5 in 2014  while unseasonably cool weather impacted the industry again in 2014 the impact was not quite as widespread nor as severe 

going forward we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity and our expectation for gradually normalized new pool and irrigation construction levels additionally we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential investment especially in outdoor lifestyle products we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 7 over this time period before reverting back to 3 to 4 annual growth over the longer term as current economic trends indicate that consumer spending has begun to slowly recover and that construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can accelerate or delay the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets in the united states and canada weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are as follows 

 

we promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives including social media we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes we also act as a day to day resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs 

growth initiatives related to our various customer programs include our retail brand licensing program and our rewards program designed for pool service professionals under our brand licensing program customers make commitments to meet minimum purchase levels stock a minimum of nine specific product categories and operate within certain guidelines including weekend hour requirements our rewards program aligns with our replacement parts growth initiative and provides customers with monthly coupons and other special discounts on parts product purchases in addition to these programs we also feature consumer showrooms in over 80 of our sales centers and host an annual retail summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management other key internal growth initiatives include the continued expansion of both our product offerings as described in the “customers and products” section below and our distribution networks 

beginning in early 2000 we significantly increased the breadth of our product offerings outside our traditional pool distribution business these complementary products included building materials used for pool construction installations and remodeling such as concrete and pool surfacing and decking materials with our march 2008 acquisition of national pool tile group inc we added a market leading brand of pool tile and composite pool finish products and gained a position in a wider market over the last five years to increase operating efficiency we consolidated and repositioned npt standalone sales centers and established npt showcases within certain existing sales centers in addition to our 12 standalone npt sales centers we currently have over 80 scp and superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where swimming pool dealers and homeowners can view and select pool components including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades and serve as stocking locations for our npt branded products 

we feel the growth opportunities for the npt network closely align with those of our other networks as we see continued opportunity to expand under the npt name both organically and through acquisitions we also expect potential expansion of the network by broadening our product range and sourcing capabilities as more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand while leveraging our existing pool and irrigationlandscape customer base we feel the development of our npt network is a natural extension of our distribution model while we are currently enjoying an expanding economy and improving housing market which help fuel demand for these products this business is more sensitive to these external market factors compared to our business overall 

we have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers given the more stabilized external environment we have increased our focus on new sales center openings including satellite locations that enable us to more effectively serve customers in existing markets since the beginning of 2012  we have opened 16  new sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations including 3  new sales centers opened in 2014  we expect to open between 7  and 9  new sales centers in 2015  since the beginning of 2012  we have completed 8  acquisitions consisting of 14  sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition the acquired locations include 5 sales centers added to our scp network and 2 sales centers added to our npt network in 2014  we plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically including the period between 2007 and 2009 when our industry contracted going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past 10 years we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases we estimate that annual price inflation was consistent with the historical average between 2012 and 2014  we anticipate price inflation will vary some by product lines but will approximate the longterm average overall in 2015 

customers and products 

we serve over 100000  customers in 2014  sales to our largest 100 customers collectively accounted for approximately 8 of our sales we approximate that our largest 1000 customers represented only 25 of our sales notably 98 of our customers are small familyowned businesses with relatively limited capital resources these core customers generated a large majority of our sales in 2014  most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors employing no more than ten employees in many cases working alone or with a limited crew these customers also buy from other distributors mass merchants home stores and specialty and internet retailers 

we sell our products primarily to the following types of customers 

 

the recent economic environment has had the greatest impact on swimming pool remodelers and builders and landscape construction companies we have seen a modest contraction in our customer base in these areas over the last several years 

we conduct our operations through 328  sales centers in north america europe south america and australia our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona collectively representing approximately 52  of our 2014  net sales in 2014  we generated close to 94  of our sales in north america less than 6 in europe and less than 1 in south america and australia combined 

we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 160000  national brand and pool corporation branded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

  

 

we track and monitor the majority of our sales at the product level to provide support for sales and marketing efforts and for consideration in incentive plan programs we currently have over 500  product lines and over 50 product categories based on our 2014  product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 13  in 2014  14  in 2013  and 15  in 2012  chemical sales increased by 3 in 2014 although chemical pricing remained relatively flat chemical sales declined 15 in 2013 reflecting lower volume due to delayed pool openings compared to 2012 and flat pricing while market share gains drove chemical volume growth of 4 in 2012 chemical sales growth did not keep pace with our overall sales growth due to lingering price deflation for certain chemical products in 2012 no other product category accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we categorize our maintenance repair and replacement products into the following two groupings 

 

in 2014  the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for approximately 60 of our sales and gross profits while approximately 40 of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools these components reflect a shift back toward more sales of major refurbishment and replacement products due to an ongoing recovery of these activities since levels reached a low point in 2009 between 2005 and early 2010 sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction prior to this industry downturn just over 50 of our total sales and gross profits were related to maintenance and minor repair products 

discretionary demand for products related to pool construction and remodeling has been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth while sales of these products declined between 2007 and 2009 we realized sales growth from 2010 to 2014 due to our ongoing expansion of these product offerings and the steady improvement in new construction remodeling and economic trends however new pool construction remains approximately 70 below peak levels reached in 2005 and approximately 60 below what we believe to be normal levels we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets we then evaluate the performance in these test markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

in recent years we have experienced product and customer mix changes including a shift in consumer spending to higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps high efficiency heaters led lighting and irrigation and landscape equipment which positively contribute to our sales and gross profit growth but negatively impact our gross margin we expect continued demand for these products but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives and the building materials product initiatives discussed above will offset these declines and lead to somewhat flat gross margin trends over the next few years 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network and hardscapes tile decking materials and interior pool finish products through our npt network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixed‑use zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

we also operate five  centralized shipping locations csls that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to offer seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool corporation these terms typically allow us to place orders in the fall prior to any seasonal price increases take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 19  11  and 7  respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2014  

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of irrigation and landscape products we also face competition both directly and indirectly from massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers both storebased and internet who buy directly from manufacturers and to a lesser extent from other distributors 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of california florida texas and arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather 

for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3700  people at december 31 2014  given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200  to 500  employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forward‑looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” “should” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward‑looking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products has been and may continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for approximately 90 of net sales and gross profits related to our swimming pool business the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbish activity in addition even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pools and irrigation systems between late 2006 and early 2010 the unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems although we have seen improvement in more recent years if these trends worsen many consumers will likely not be able to obtain financing for pool and irrigation projects which could negatively impact our sales of construction related products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions which could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations and negatively impact our sales while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 19  11  and 7  respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2014  a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers could also adversely affect our business we dedicate considerable resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe significantly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers large pool or landscape supply retailers and internet retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 52  of our net sales in 2014  also tend to be more competitive than others 

more aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel this includes succession planning related to our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through organic market share gains new sales center openings and acquisitions that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since the beginning of 2012  we have opened 16 new sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations and we have completed 8 acquisitions consisting of 14  sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition while we contemplate continued growth through internal expansion and acquisitions no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2014  we generated approximately 65  of our net sales and 96  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of both swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and landscape installations and maintenance our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations which accounted for 93  of our total net sales in 2014  expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell and distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation and psl branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase the risk of claims may also be greater with respect to products manufactured by thirdparty suppliers outside the united states particularly in china uncertainties with respect to foreign legal systems may adversely affect us in resolving claims arising from our foreign sourced products even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and our company 

for foreign sourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products and there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

we rely on information technology systems to support our business operations any disturbance or breach of our technological infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally failure to maintain the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

information technology supports several aspects of our business   including among others product sourcing pricing customer service financial reporting collections and cost management our ability to operate effectively on a day to day basis depends on a solid technological infrastructure which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats we are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunication failures internet failures and other catastrophic events exposure to various types of cyberattacks such as malware computer viruses worms or other malicious acts as well as human error could also potentially disrupt our operations or result in a significant interruption in the delivery of our goods and services 

we have designed numerous procedures and protocols to mitigate these risks we continually invest in information technology security and update our business continuity plan however the failure to maintain security over and prevent unauthorized access to our data our customers’ personal information including credit card information or data belonging to our suppliers could put us at a competitive disadvantage result in damage to our reputation and subject us to potential litigation liability fines and penalties resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporation corporate offices which consist of approximately 54800  square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50  ownership interest we own three  sales center facilities in florida and one  in texas we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three  to seven  year terms 

as of december 31 2014  we had 11  leases with remaining terms longer than seven  years that expire between 2022  and 2027  most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000  square feet to 60000  square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls range in size from approximately 71000  square feet to 115000  square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during the year ended december 31 2014

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including product liability personal injury commercial contract and employment matters litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 

as previously disclosed a number of purported antitrust class action suits were filed against us in various united states district courts in 2012 the cases were transferred and consolidated before the judicial panel for multidistrict litigation mdl docket no 2328 and are presently pending in the eastern district of louisiana the plaintiffs include indirect purchaser plaintiffs purporting to represent indirect purchasers of swimming pool products in arizona california florida and missouri and direct purchaser plaintiffs who are current or former customers three additional defendants include hayward industries inc pentair water pool and spa inc and zodiac pool systems inc the plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and enhanced damages interest costs and fees and other equitable relief on april 11 2013 the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the direct purchasers’ antitrust claim on may 24 2013 the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the indirect purchasers’ antitrust claims both direct and indirect purchaser plaintiffs amended their complaints and defendants moved to dismiss certain of the direct purchasers’ claims on december 18 2013 the court granted in part and denied in part those motions 

on september 26 2014 the court preliminarily approved a class action settlement between hayward industries inc and the direct purchaser plaintiffs on december 22 2014 the court preliminarily approved a class action settlement between zodiac pool systems inc and the direct purchaser plaintiffs on december 31 2014 the court preliminarily approved a class action settlement between hayward industries inc zodiac pool systems inc and the indirect purchaser plaintiffs we along with pentair water pool and spa inc continue to defend ourselves in this matter 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental transportation and health and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals as previously disclosed the office of the district attorney for the county of riverside california made a monetary demand upon us for civil penalties alleging noncompliance in the past with local and state hazardous waste handling storage and transportation laws fire and building code regulations and california business  professions code section 17200 primarily relating to liquid chlorine and muriatic acid on august 30 2013 the office of the district attorney for the county of riverside california filed a complaint against us for civil penalties alleging the same matters 

while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable based on currently available facts we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters or other claims and litigation not discussed above will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and related events unfold

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for a discussion of our base business calculations see the results of operations section below 

in our discussion of results of operations below adjusted operating income adjusted net income attributable to pool corporation and adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2012 exclude the goodwill impairment line item on the consolidated statements of income we have provided these adjusted amounts because we believe it helps investors assess our yearoveryear operating performance 

2014  financial overview 

financial results 

our record results for 2014  marked another year of significant success and consistent investment in the future our base business results showed sustained growth as we continued to gain share by providing progressively more value and better service to our customers and suppliers additionally we expanded our presence globally and broadened our product base strengthening our capabilities in areas we expect will deliver unique longterm value 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2014   in creased 8  compared to 2013  base business sales increased 7  which reflects increased demand for discretionary products particularly in our building materials and equipment product offerings as well as continued growth in sales of pool and landscaping maintenance products replacement and remodel activity demand for energy efficient products and market share gains resulting from our team’s high customer service levels drove our sales growth 

  

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2014   in creased 9  over 2013  gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin in creased 20 basis points to 286  for 2014  

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses for 2014   in creased 7  from 2013  base business operating expenses increased 5  year over year primarily due to greater personnel costs including performancebased incentive compensation expense higher freight costs increased facilityrelated expenses and higher professional fees 

operating income for the year improved 14  over 2013  operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin increased to 84  in 2014  compared to 80  in 2013  

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 14  compared to 2013  while earnings per share was up 19  to a record 244  per diluted share 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations was  1218 million  in 2014  and exceeded total net income by  108 million  combined with 734 million  in net proceeds from borrowings cash from operating activities helped fund the following initiatives 

 

total net receivables including pledged receivables in creased 12  compared to december 31 2013  this increase is consistent with our december 2014 sales growth which included an additional billing day compared to december 2013  our receivables quality remains high with days sales outstanding dso as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis of 287 days at december 31 2014  compared to 281 days at december 31 2013  

inventory levels grew 9  to 4670 million  at december 31 2014  compared to 4292 million  at december 31 2013  our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis were 34 times at both december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  

total debt outstanding of  3208 million  at december 31 2014   in creased 744 million  compared to december 31 2013  primarily to fund greater share repurchases in 2014  versus 2013  

current trends and outlook 

the pool industry continued to show signs of recovery in 2014  mostly due to the gradual improvement in remodeling and replacement activity heightened demand for discretionary products that create and enhance outdoor living areas supported industry growth stability in singlefamily home construction markets also benefited the landscape and irrigation business 

the economic downturn between 2007 and 2009 had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000  new units in 2009 to approximately 60000  new units in 2014  construction levels are still down more than 70  compared to peak levels in 2005 and down approximately 60 from what we consider normal levels 

the rebound in our base business sales growth began in 2010 and reflects continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures and higher replacement activities largely supported by improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence employment housing consumer financing and economic expansion we estimate the industry grew 3 to 5 each year from 2010 to 2012 in 2013 we estimate industry growth dipped temporarily to approximately 1 to 2 given the impact of adverse weather on seasonal markets and then returned to 3 to 5 in 2014  while unseasonably cool weather impacted the industry again in 2014 the impact was not quite as widespread nor as severe 

going forward we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity and our expectation for gradually normalized new pool and irrigation construction levels additionally we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential investment especially in outdoor lifestyle products we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 7 over this time period before reverting back to 3 to 4 annual growth over the longer term as current economic trends indicate that consumer spending has begun to slowly recover and that construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

for 2015 we expect the macroeconomic environment in the united states and the opportunities available to us to grow market share will be quite similar to 2014  as for international markets the us dollar is currently significantly stronger against most major currencies versus a year ago we expect this condition to remain throughout 2015 adversely impacting our reported sales by about 1 but having little impact on our 2015 bottom line results we project 6 to 8 base business sales growth including our expectation for average inflationary product cost increases of 1 to 2 we expect to gain market share through our comprehensive product offerings which we continually diversify geographic expansion in 2014  and investments in people and technology we also expect to modestly expand our presence by opening five to seven new locations in 2015 and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise we believe our sales growth will continue to be weighted toward sales of lower margin discretionary products but due to our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives and our building materials product initiatives will result in relatively neutral gross margin trends for the full year 

overall we anticipate operating expenses will grow at approximately half the rate of our gross profit growth in 2015 reflecting inflationary increases and incremental costs to support our sales growth expectations we expect base business results will generate operating profit growth in the midteens 

based on these expectations we project that 2015 earnings will range from 272 to 287 per diluted share we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2015  and anticipate that we may use approximately 1000 million to 1500 million in cash for share repurchases 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging these reserves range from 01 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 02  of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales were 01  in 2014  01  in 2013  and 01  in 2012  we expect that writeoffs will remain at approximately 01  of net sales in 2015  

at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend allowance for doubtful accounts balance to i current year writeoffs and ii any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2014  pretax income would change by approximately 08 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 001  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2014  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity we classify products into 13 classes at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the past 12 months or 36 months for tile and parts products all inventory is included in these classes except for special order nonstock items that lack an sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 



there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months’ usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend obsolescence reserve balance to i current year inventory writeoffs and ii the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2014  pretax income would change by approximately 13 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 002  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2014  

vendor incentives 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor incentives as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor incentive arrangements are based on calendar year periods we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase levels in the first quarter of the subsequent year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor incentives received to the prior year vendor incentive balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our vendor incentive estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our gross margins for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2014  we have not provided for united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if these earnings are repatriated to the united states in the future or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation 

  

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions historically our foreign locations have not generated adequate earnings to both repatriate to the united states and fund foreign operations those historical and future foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested and be used to support our foreign operations and pay nonus obligations 

we have operations in 39  states 1  united states territory and 11  foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions assess the probability of examinations by taxing authorities and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

each year we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns based on this hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate 

incentive compensation accrual 

our incentive compensation structure is designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share 

management sets the objectives for our bonus plans at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record incentive compensation accruals based on positive operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives starting in june and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

our quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year each year we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year end to determine the accuracy of our incentive compensation estimates based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our incentive compensation accrual balance was within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill is our largest intangible asset at december 31 2014  our goodwill balance was 1739 million  representing approximately 19  of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units falls below its carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center as of october 1 2014  we had 215  reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the highest goodwill balance was 57 million  and the average goodwill balance was 08 million  

in october 2014  and october 2013  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level during the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis based on our identification of impairment indicators related to our results through the end of the 2012 pool season as a result of our interim impairment analysis in the third quarter of 2012 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 69 million equal to the total carrying amount of our united kingdom reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows we project future cash flows using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates operating margins discount rates and multiples these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value estimates we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium our aggregate estimated fair values were 5 below our market capitalization which we consider to be conservative but reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test our sensitivity analysis which incorporated more conservative projected cash flow assumptions and fell close to 10 below our market capitalization resulted in the identification of no goodwill impairments and no additional locations as potentially at risk 

we performed a second sensitivity analysis over our two remaining key fair value assumptions and determined that a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate would generate fair value estimates significantly below our market capitalization evidencing that our estimates for these assumptions fell at the conservative end of a range of acceptable estimates 

based on the magnitude of its goodwill balance and the continued economic challenges in italy we currently consider our italy reporting unit as most at risk for goodwill impairment our most sensitive estimates pertain to this reporting unit’s product mix and the related impact on our gross margin projections which are incorporated into our discounted cash flow assumptions as of december 31 2014  our atrisk reporting unit in italy had a goodwill balance of 38 million  one reporting unit in quebec canada which has a significant goodwill balance was identified at risk for goodwill impairment when results began to fall below expectations in 2013 largely due to its heightened sensitivity to weather and certain execution challenges we cannot be assured of favorable weather conditions in any given year which strongly impact this reporting unit’s results as of december 31 2014  our atrisk reporting unit in quebec had a goodwill balance of 27 million  

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting units discussed above impairment charges would decrease operating income negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 which requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers asu 201409 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap the guidance may be applied using either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we are currently evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2014  2013  and 2012  we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2014  compared to fiscal year 2013   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



 

when calculating our base business results we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2014  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales increased 8  compared to last year including a 7  increase in base business sales after last year’s late start to the pool season we anticipated a comparative benefit from more favorable weather conditions in 2014  but this expectation did not materialize due to prolonged cold and wet weather in many of our seasonal markets particularly canada and the northern united states as a result the timing of 2014  pool openings in many of those areas was similar to 2013 in 2014  base business sales increased by 5 in our seasonal markets versus 8 in our largest yearround markets compared to 2013 

the overall base business sales increase also reflected the impact of the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

sales of building materials and tile grew by 20 compared to last year collectively these products accounted for close to 10 of our total sales our continued strong growth in building materials reflected market share growth resulting from our expansion of stocking locations and broader product offerings as well as the partial recovery in pool remodeling sales of equipment which includes heaters pumps lighting and filters increased by approximately 11 compared to last year chemical sales increased by 3 while chemical pricing remained relatively flat 

base business sales increased 9 in the first quarter of 2014  approximately 2 of our first quarter sales growth reflected a change in the timing of customer early buy purchases which effectively shifted sales into the first quarter of 2014  that historically have occurred in the second quarter despite not having the expected benefit of a return to normal seasonal weather patterns we realized base business sales growth of 7 and 5 in the second and third quarters of 2014  for our seasonally slow fourth quarter base business sales increased 8 in 2014  as we capitalized on favorable weather conditions during this time period see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  beginning on page 34 

gross profit 



gross margin increased 20 basis points over last year we believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives in 2014  as well as higher volume incentives from certain of our vendors contributed to this improvement favorable product mix due to higher building materials sales growth rates and a reduction in equipment sales growth rates compared to 2013  also added some benefit given comparatively lower margins on heaters pumps lighting and filters the unfavorable gross margin impact of first quarter 2014  customer early buy purchases somewhat offset these benefits purchases included in customer early buys are primarily comprised of lower margin discretionary products and include applicable discounts 

year over year gross margin comparisons ranged from mostly flat to slightly improved each quarter during 2014  with a decline of 20 basis points in the first quarter due to the impact of customer early buy purchases described above then improvements of 25 basis points in the second quarter 50 basis points in the third quarter and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter which also reflects some benefit from our recent acquisitions 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 7  compared to 2013  with base business operating expenses up 5  the increase in base business operating expenses is primarily attributed to the following listed in order of magnitude with approximate impact 

 

interest expense net 

interest expense net increased 11 compared to 2013  average outstanding debt was 3429 million for 2014  versus 2561 million for 2013  the weighted average effective interest rate declined to 19 in 2014  compared to 24 in 2013  the decrease in our effective interest rate compared to last year reflects the utilization of available borrowing capacity on our receivables facility at lower interest rates than under our credit facility 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 389  at december 31 2014  consistent with our rate of 388  at december 31 2013  

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 14  to 1107 million  in 2014  compared to 973 million  in 2013  while earnings per share increased 19  to 244  per diluted share compared to 205  per diluted share in 2013  

earnings per share for 2014  included an accretive impact of approximately 005 per diluted share from the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchase activities during the year 

fiscal year 2013  compared to fiscal year 2012   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



for an explanation of how we calculate base business please refer to the discussion of base business on page 26 u nder the heading “fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013”    

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2013 to the year ended december 31 2012 we excluded acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below there was one sales center opened in a new market that was excluded from base business as of december 31 2013 



 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2013 



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales as well as base business sales increased 6 in 2013 the base business sales increase is comprised of a 6 increase from swimming pool product sales and an 11 increase from irrigation product sales in local currencies net sales in europe were relatively flat compared to 2012 reflecting the impact of cold and wet weather conditions on results over the first half of the year and the effects of the continued difficult economic environment 

the principal factors impacting our base business sales growth included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

sales of building materials and tile grew by 20 in 2013 compared to 2012 although collectively these products only accounted for approximately 11 of our total sales chemical sales declined by 15 reflecting lower volume due to delayed pool openings compared to 2012 while chemical pricing remained relatively flat 

we realized base business sales growth of 2 in the first quarter and 4 in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the 2012 periods throughout the first half of 2013 comparatively difficult weather versus the first half of 2012 suppressed our sales growth sales through may of 2012 benefited from unusually favorable weather especially across the eastern half of north america record warm temperatures in the northeast and midwest united states spurred an earlier than normal start to remodeling projects and new pool construction in the 2012 season in 2013 later than normal pool openings in our seasonal markets in north america and europe further added to these challenging comparisons weather normalized in the latter half of 2013 leading to base business sales growth of 9 in the third quarter and 11 in the fourth quarter see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  beginning on page 34 

gross profit 



gross margin declined approximately 60 basis points from 2012  this decrease is primarily due to unfavorable product mix customer mix and geographic mix as well as competitive pricing pressures doubledigit sales growth of higher value lower margin discretionary products such as variable speed pumps high efficiency heaters led lighting products irrigation systems and landscape equipment positively contributed to sales and gross profit dollars but negatively impacted our margins this growth outpaced our sales of higher margin nondiscretionary product lines generally associated with basic pool maintenance and repair activity additionally as a result of the slower start to the 2013 season geographic regions with generally higher margins contributed a proportionally smaller share of our total sales growth 

the following factors collectively impacted gross margin throughout 2013 

 

year over year gross margin comparisons fell below the prior year each quarter during 2013 with declines of 60 basis points in the first quarter 50 basis points in the second quarter 60 basis points in the third quarter and 90 basis points in the fourth quarter these declines reflect the changes in product and customer mix discussed above while geographic mix also contributed to the margin decline in the first and second quarters of 2013 the larger decline in the fourth quarter is due primarily to a more favorable impact on fourth quarter 2012 gross margins from certain vendor incentives 

operating expenses 



operating expenses as well as base business operating expenses increased 2 compared to 2012 increases in overall compensationrelated costs driven by inflationary salary increases and headcount increases to support new sales centers and higher professional fees were partially offset by a reduction in performancebased compensation 

interest expense net 

interest expense net for 2013 was consistent with 2012 average outstanding debt was 2561 million for 2013 versus 2503 million for 2012 the weighted average effective interest rate declined slightly to 24 in 2013 compared to 26 in 2012 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 388 at december 31 2013 compared to 410 at december 31 2012 excluding the impact of the 2012 goodwill impairment charge our effective income tax rate for 2012 was 398 the impact on the provision from the change in our valuation allowance for foreign net operating losses was 057 in 2013 compared to 197 in 2012 

net income and earnings per share 

net income attributable to pool corporation increased 19 to 973 million in 2013 compared to 820 million in 2012 while earnings per share increased 20 to 205 per diluted share compared to 171 per diluted share in 2012 excluding the 69 million 014 per diluted share impact from the goodwill impairment charge in 2012 net income attributable to pool corporation for 2013 increased 9 over 2012 adjusted net income attributable to pool corporation of 889 million while diluted eps increased 11 from adjusted diluted earnings per share of 185 for 2012 

earnings per share for 2013 also included an accretive impact of approximately 002 per diluted share from the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchase activities during the year 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2014  we generated approximately 65  of our net sales and 96  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2014  and 2013  we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  



  

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 



after last year’s late start to the pool season we anticipated a comparative benefit from more favorable weather conditions in 2014 however our seasonal markets experienced cooler than normal temperatures yet another year the northeast parts of the midwest and eastern canada experienced near record cold temperatures and substantial snowfall during the first quarter of 2014 cold and wet weather persisted through april and may of 2014 particularly in canada and the northern united states limiting second quarter sales growth in many of our seasonal markets through may late season snow impacted the rocky mountain region while parts of the midwest felt the impact of muchdelayed thawing from snowfall in the winter and early spring similar conditions continued through the third quarter as parts of the northeast and substantially all of the southeast and central portions of the united states experienced cooler than normal temperatures 

our largest yearround markets experienced quite different weather conditions in 2014 as temperatures in florida were normal to above average and the west experienced warmer than average to record high temperatures almost all year especially california and arizona however severe drought conditions persisted in parts of california and arizona through the second quarter which limited second quarter sales growth in these markets temperatures and rainfall were closer to normal in texas and the southeast united states during the second quarter which provided some relief from the difficult conditions we faced in other areas despite rainfall during the third and fourth quarters severe drought conditions continued to afflict california drought conditions also developed in texas while the southwest accumulated significant rainfall during the third quarter in our seasonally slow fourth quarter temperatures and precipitation levels ranged from normal to above average for most of the united states 

unfavorable weather in 2013 compared to 2012 significantly impacted our 2013 results for 2013 net sales growth of 11 in our largest yearround markets tracked well above the 2 growth in our seasonal markets although this differential narrowed throughout the third and fourth quarters as weather comparisons normalized we experienced the greatest weather impacts in the second quarter of 2013 as we observed above normal precipitation across nearly the entire united states with the exception of california texas the southwest and the rockies below normal temperatures in the central and southeast united states and in europe differed significantly from the above normal temperatures experienced in the second quarter of 2012 these conditions resulted in delayed pool openings in comparison to 2012 which directly affected sales in most seasonal markets as evidenced by the sales growth variations between our yearround and seasonal markets weather trends in our seasonal markets largely normalized in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 resulting in sales growth rates in our seasonal markets to more closely align with sales growth rates in our largest yearround markets 

as discussed above weather favorably impacted sales in 2012 particularly in the first quarter favorable weather trends continued in the beginning of the second quarter with much higher than normal temperatures across the united states excluding the pacific northwest the three month period between march and may 2012 was the warmest on record both nationally and for 31 of the 37 states east of the rocky mountains the unusually mild winter and record warm spring led sales to shift into the first and early second quarter and resulted in the earlier than normal peak of the 2012 season june sales were negatively impacted by weather due to below normal temperatures across the southeast and cooler temperatures compared to 2011 in most markets excluding california and the southwest in the third and fourth quarters of 2012 weather conditions were favorable in most markets but comparable overall to the same period in 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent debt structure and returning money to our shareholders our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

as discussed further under the subheading future sources and uses of cash  on page 37 we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under our debt agreements including the maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio although more conservative than the maximum we strive to maintain an average total leverage ratio of 150 to 200 within the constraints of these metrics we determine the timing and extent to which we will repurchase our common stock under board authorized repurchase programs andor repay our debt 

capital expenditures have historically averaged 05 to 10 of net sales capital expenditures were 08 of net sales in 2014  09 of net sales in 2013 and 08 of net sales in 2012 going forward we project capital expenditures will be near the high end of our historical range due to our continued investment in new vehicles equipment and technology in recent years we have purchased rather than leased new vehicles and forklifts a practice which we expect will continue 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations of  1218 million  in 2014  exceeded net income by  108 million  compared to 2013 cash provided by operations increased primarily due to higher net income and improvements in working capital management in 2013 cash provided by operations exceeded net income by 78 million and declined compared to 2012 primarily due to timing differences in the inventory purchase and payment cycle 

cash used in investing activities for 2014  included 106 million  in net payments to fund four acquisitions in contrast cash used in investing activities for 2013 reflected lower acquisition payments compared to both 2014  and 2012 

cash used in financing activities declined in 2014  mostly due to increases in our net borrowings partially offset by greater repurchases of our shares in the open market and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to fewer stock option exercises we had 734 million  of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2014  compared to 155 million  in 2013 in 2014  we repurchased 1323 million of shares on the open market up 380 million compared to 2013 

cash used in financing activities also declined in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to changes in our net borrowings offset by repurchases of our shares in the open market we had 155 million  of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2013 compared to net payments of 164 million  in 2012 in 2013 we repurchased 943 million of shares on the open market up 173 million compared to 2012 

future sources and uses of cash 

as amended on november 20 2014 our credit facility provides for 4650 million in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 5400 million the credit facility matures on november 20 2019 we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2014  there was 2517 million  outstanding and 2095 million  available for borrowing under the credit facility we currently have five interest rate swap contracts in place that reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on the credit facility these swap contracts convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 1185 on notional amounts totaling 500 million 1100 on a notional amount of 500 million 1050 on a notional amount of 250 million and 0990 on a notional amount of 250 million interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swaps is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility all five swap contracts will terminate on october 19 2016 

in may 2014 we entered into four forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to future fluctuations in interest rates on our credit facility these new swap contracts will convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 2520 on a notional amount of 250 million 2450 on a notional amount of 500 million 2339 on a notional amount of 500 million and 2256 on a notional amount of 250 million each of these forwardstarting swap contracts becomes effective on october 19 2016 and terminates on september 20 2018 

the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2014  was approximately 20  excluding commitment fees 

financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2014  the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 37 

the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends additionally we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50 limit described above so long as i the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50 limit and ii our average total leverage ratio is less than 300 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice 

under the credit facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in penalty payments higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

as amended on october 24 2014 our twoyear receivables facility offers us a lower cost form of financing with a peak funding capacity of up to 1400 million between may 1 and june 30 and other funding capacities of up to 700 million between october 1 and february 28 and up to 1200 million between march 1 and april 30 and between july 1 and september 30 an additional seasonal borrowing capacity of up to 400 million may be available between april 1 and july 31 

the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary the securitization subsidiary the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds limited to the applicable funding capacities upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due 

the receivables facility contains terms and conditions including representations covenants and conditions precedent customary for transactions of this type additionally an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio average total funded debtebitda of 325 to 100 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio ebitdarcash interest expense plus rental expense of 225 to 100 

at december 31 2014  there was 676 million  outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 09 

as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2015  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 20 2015  645 million  of the current boardauthorized amount under our share repurchase program remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares on the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2014  our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 



for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments in thousands related to our longterm debt obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2014  outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2014  for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swaps to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility and the receivables facility for certain of our contractual obligations such as unrecognized tax benefits uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time as such we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table see note 7 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k for more information related to our unrecognized tax benefits 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2014  there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts for the credit facility the portion of our outstanding balance under the credit facility and the receivables facility that was not covered by our interest rate swap contracts were both subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2014  related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under the credit facility excluding the accordion feature and the offseason maximum amount available under the receivables facility in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility and the receivables facility increased by 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 42 million  and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 006  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2014  the maximum amount available under the credit facility is 4650 million  excluding the 750 million  accordion feature and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility is 1400 million  excluding the 400 million  seasonal increase in capacity available from april to july 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom belgium france germany italy portugal spain mexico colombia and australia based on the functional currencies for these international subsidiaries as shown in the table below changes in exchange rates for these currencies may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 93  of total net sales in 2014  our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2015  and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results 






 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

the term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the act the rules refer to the controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the act is 1 recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and 2 accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of december 31 2014  management including the ceo and cfo performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation management including the ceo and cfo concluded that as of december 31 2014  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective

 item 1 business 

general 

based on industry data pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us  or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2013  we operated 321  sales centers in north america europe and south america through our three distribution networks 

 

our scp network includes nine domestic sales centers designated as national pool tile npt locations our npt locations focus on selling specialized products under the npt brand including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes our scp network also includes 31 international sales centers 

superior and horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of scp which is wholly owned by pool corporation 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 80 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 12  currently have a pool significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools technological advancements and the development of energyefficient products the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize longterm growth rates similar to the pool industry as irrigation system installations and landscaping often occur in tandem with new singlefamily home construction we believe the continued recovery in the housing industry also offers significant opportunities for the irrigation and landscape industry 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

 

approximately 60  of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance related goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic along with relatively consistent inflationary price increases of 1 to 2 on average passed on by manufacturers and distributors has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable 

economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground and aboveground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2014 pk data inc reports 

the replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 30 of consumer spending in the pool industry the activity in this market which includes major swimming pool remodeling is based on the aging of the installed base of pools the timing of these types of expenditures are more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of the remaining consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and landscape products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market irrigation and landscape maintenance activities account for approximately 40  of total spending in the irrigation industry with the remaining 60  of spending related to irrigation construction and other discretionary related products as such our irrigation business is more heavily weighted toward new construction activities and the sale of discretionary related products compared to our pool business and is therefore more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending our irrigation and landscape business has recently benefited from the continued recovery of singlefamily home construction as irrigation system installations and landscaping projects typically correlate with but lag new home construction 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments and equipment replacement we believe that over the long term housing turnover and single‑family home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and unemployment 

the economic downturn between 2007 and 2009 had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximately 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000  new units in 2009  to approximately 60000  new units in 2013  construction levels are still down more than 70 compared to peak levels in 2005 and down approximately 60 from what we consider to be normal levels 

the rebound in our base business sales growth beginning in 2010 reflects continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures higher replacement activities and market share gains given our estimated industry growth of 3 to 5 for 2010 to 2012 improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence employment housing consumer financing and economic expansion helped support this growth in 2013 we estimate industry growth dipped temporarily to approximately 1 to 2 given the impact of adverse weather on seasonal markets 

going forward we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity and our expectation for gradually normalized new pool and irrigation construction levels we also expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 7 over this time period before reverting back to 3 to 4 annual growth over the longer term as current economic trends indicate that consumer spending has begun to slowly recover and that construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can accelerate or delay the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets in the united states and canada weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are as follows 

 

we promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industry oriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives including social media we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes we also act as a daytoday resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers unique needs 

growth initiatives related to our various customer programs include our retail brand licensing program and our rewards program designed for pool service professionals under our brand licensing program customers make commitments to meet minimum purchase levels stock a minimum of nine specific product categories and operate within certain guidelines including weekend hour requirements our rewards program aligns with our replacement parts growth initiative and provides customers with monthly coupons and other special discounts on parts product purchases in addition to these programs we also feature consumer showrooms in over 80 of our sales centers and host an annual retail summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management other key internal growth initiatives include the continued expansion of both our product offerings as described in the “customers and products” section below and our distribution networks 

we have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers given the more stabilized external environment we have increased our focus on new sales center openings including satellite locations that enable us to more effectively serve customers in existing markets since the beginning of 2011  we have opened 17  new sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations including the 10  new sales centers opened in 2013  we expect to open between 7  and 9  new sales centers in 2014  since the beginning of 2011  we have completed 7  acquisitions consisting of 13  sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition the acquired locations include 2 sales centers added to our scp network in 2013  

we plan to continue to selectively expand our swimming pool and irrigation distribution networks via both acquisitions and new sales center openings we plan to make strategic acquisitions to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically including the period between 2007 and 2009 when our industry contracted going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past 10 years we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases we estimate that annual price inflation was consistent with the historical average between 2011 and 2013 with 2011 price inflation closer to 2 we anticipate price inflation will vary some by product lines but will approximate the long term average overall in 2014 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 80000  customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve five types of customers 

 

the majority of these customers are small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources the recent economic environment has had the greatest impact on swimming pool remodelers and builders and landscape construction companies we have seen a modest contraction in our customer base in these areas over the last several years 

we conduct our operations through 321  sales centers in north america europe and south america our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 52  of our net sales in 2013  in 2013 we generated close to 95  of our sales in north america 5 in europe and less than 1 in south america 

we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 160000  national brand and pool corporation branded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

  

 

we track and monitor the majority of our sales at the product level to provide support for sales and marketing efforts and for consideration in incentive plan programs we currently have over 400  product lines and over 50 product categories based on our 2013  product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 14  in 2013  15  in 2012  and 16  in 2011  chemical sales declined 15 in 2013 reflecting lower volume due to delayed pool openings compared to 2012 while chemical pricing remained relatively flat while market share gains drove chemical volume growth of 4 in 2012 and 6 in 2011 chemical sales growth did not keep pace with our overall sales growth due to price deflation of approximately 2 in 2011 and lingering price deflation for certain chemical products in 2012 no other product category accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we categorize our maintenance repair and replacement products into the following two groupings 

 

in 2013 the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for approximately 60 of our sales and gross profits while approximately 40 of sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools these components reflect a shift back toward more sales of major refurbishment and replacement products due to an ongoing recovery of these activities since levels reached a low point in 2009 between 2005 and early 2010 sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction prior to this industry downturn just over 50 of our total sales and gross profits were related to maintenance and minor repair products 

since our acquisition of npt in 2008 we have expanded the number of sales center locations that offer npt tile and composite pool finish products from the original 14  locations to over 80 locations these locations feature consumer showrooms where swimming pool dealers and homeowners can view and select pool components including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades another key product initiative has been the expansion of our replacement parts offerings these product initiatives along with the continued expansion of our pool corporation branded products have contributed to gross margin improvements over time however throughout 2012 and 2013 we experienced product and customer mix changes including a shift in consumer spending to higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps high efficiency heaters led lighting and irrigation and landscape equipment which positively impacted our sales growth but negatively impacted our gross margin 

discretionary demand for products related to pool construction and remodeling has been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth while sales of these products declined between 2007 and 2009 we realized sales growth from 2010 to 2013 due to our ongoing expansion of these product offerings and the steady improvement in new construction remodeling and economic trends however new pool construction remains approximately 70 below peak levels reached in 2005 and approximately 60 below what we believe to be normal levels we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets we then evaluate the performance in these test markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network while we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixed‑use zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

we also operate five  centralized shipping locations csls that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to offer seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool corporation these terms typically allow us to place orders in the fall prior to any seasonal price increases take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 18  11  and 8  respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2013  

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of irrigation and landscape products we also face competition both directly and indirectly from massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers both storebased and internet who buy directly from manufacturers and to a lesser extent from other distributors 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of california florida texas and arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather 

for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3600  people at december 31 2013  given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200  to 500  employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property 

we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our pool corporation branded products that are important to our current and future business operations we also own rights to numerous internet domain names

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forward‑looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” “should” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward‑looking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products has been and may continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for approximately 90 of our net sales and gross profits the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbish activity in addition even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pools and irrigation systems the recent unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market have resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which has limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems if these trends continue or worsen many consumers will likely not be able to obtain financing for pool and irrigation projects which could negatively impact our sales of construction related products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions which could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations and negatively impact our sales while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 18  11  and 8  respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2013  a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers could also adversely affect our business we dedicate considerable resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe significantly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers large pool or landscape supply retailers and internet retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 52  of our net sales in 2013  also tend to be more competitive than others 

more aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel this includes succession planning related to our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through organic market share gains new sales center openings and acquisitions that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since the beginning of 2011  we have opened 17 new sales centers net of sales center closing and consolidations and we have completed 7 acquisitions consisting of 13  sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition while we contemplate continued growth through internal expansion and acquisitions no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2013  we generated approximately 66  of our net sales and essentially 100 of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of both swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and landscape installations and maintenance our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling annual registration and licensing 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell and distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase the risk of claims may also be greater with respect to products manufactured by thirdparty suppliers outside the united states particularly in china uncertainties with respect to foreign legal systems may adversely affect us in resolving claims arising from our foreign sourced products even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and our company 

for foreign sourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products and there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

we rely on information technology systems to support our business operations and any disturbance or breach of our technological infrastructure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

information technology supports several aspects of our business   including among others product sourcing pricing customer service financial reporting collections and cost management our ability to operate effectively on a day to day basis depends on a solid technological infrastructure which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats we are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure internet failures and other catastrophic events exposure to various types of cyberattacks such as malware computer viruses worms or other malicious acts as well as human error could also potentially disrupt our operations or result in a significant interruption in the delivery of our goods and services 

we have designed numerous procedures and protocols to mitigate these risks we continually invest in information technology security and update our business continuity plan however the failure to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to confidential customer information or data belonging to us or our suppliers could put us at a competitive disadvantage result in damage to our reputation and subject us to potential litigation liability fines and penalties resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporation corporate offices which consist of approximately 53000  square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50  ownership interest we own three  sales center facilities in florida and one  in texas we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three  to seven  year terms 

as of december 31 2013  we had 12  leases with remaining terms longer than seven  years that expire between 2021  and 2027  most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000  square feet to 60000  square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls range in size from approximately 71000  square feet to 115000  square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during the year ended december 31 2013

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including product liability personal injury commercial contract and employment matters litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 

in 2012 a number of purported antitrust class action suits were filed against us in various united states district courts the cases were transferred and consolidated before the judicial panel for multidistrict litigation mdl docket no 2328 and are presently pending in the eastern district of louisiana the plaintiffs include indirect purchaser plaintiffs purporting to represent indirect purchasers of swimming pool products in arizona california florida and missouri and direct purchaser plaintiffs who are current or former customers three additional defendants include hayward industries inc pentair water pool and spa inc and zodiac pool systems inc the plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and enhanced damages interest costs and fees and other equitable relief we believe the amended complaints are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental transportation and health and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals as previously disclosed in 2012 the office of the district attorney for the county of riverside california made a monetary demand upon us for civil penalties alleging noncompliance in the past with local and state hazardous waste handling storage and transportation laws fire and building code regulations and california business  professions code section 17200 primarily relating to liquid chlorine and muriatic acid on august 30 2013 the office of the district attorney for the county of riverside california filed a complaint against us for civil penalties alleging the same matters although we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter based on information currently available to us we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable based on currently available facts we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters or other claims and litigation not discussed above will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and related events unfold

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for a discussion of our base business calculations see the results of operations section below 

in our discussion of results of operations below adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the 2012 and 2011 periods exclude the goodwill impairment line item on the consolidated statements of income we have provided these adjusted amounts because we believe it helps investors assess our yearoveryear operating performance 

2013 financial overview 

financial results 

in 2013 we surpassed 20 billion in sales a fitting accomplishment for our milestone 20th year we achieved record results including diluted earnings per share eps of 205 despite persistent and challenging external factors in our business how we distribute products is as important as what products we distribute we believe that our success reflects the totality of having the right products available at the right time coupled with exceptional service complemented by innovative programs and tools resulting in the valueadd we provide to the marketplace 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2013   in creased 6  compared to 2012  base business sales increased 6  including a 6  increase from swimming pool product sales and an 11  increase from irrigation and landscape product sales base business sales growth reflects market growth market share gains and the ongoing recovery of discretionary product sales partially offset by weather driven declines in nondiscretionary product sales primarily in our seasonal markets for 2013 net sales growth of 11 in our largest yearround markets tracked well above the 2 growth in our seasonal markets although this difference lessened as weather comparisons normalized later in the year 

  

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2013   in creased 4  over 2012  gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin de creased 60 basis points to 284  for 2013  product customer and geographic mix changes adversely impacted gross margin in 2013 product mix changes reflected a shift in consumer spending to certain lower margin discretionary products such as variable speed pumps high efficiency heaters led lighting products irrigation systems and landscape equipment relative to higher margin nondiscretionary products generally associated with basic pool maintenance and repair activity additionally due to the later start to the 2013 season we experienced higher sales growth rates in our lower margin yearround markets than in our higher margin seasonal markets which negatively impacted gross margins 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses for 2013   in creased 2  from 2012  base business operating expenses increased 2  year over year as salary and other variable expense increases were partially offset by decreases in performance‑based compensation 

in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis for our united kingdom reporting unit and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge equal to the total goodwill carrying amount of 69 million which had a 014 negative impact on diluted eps for the year ended december 31 2012 

  

operating income for the year improved 14  over 2012 and increased 9  compared to adjusted operating income for 2012  operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin increased to 80  in 2013  compared to 74  in 2012  adjusted operating margin was 78  in 2012  

net income increased 19  compared to 2012  while eps was up 20  to a record 205  per diluted share compared to adjusted net income for 2012 net income increased 9  while diluted eps increased 11  from adjusted diluted eps for 2012  

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations of  1051 million  in 2013  was  78 million  more than net income and combined with 155 million in net proceeds from our revolving line of credit and receivables securitization facility and  214 million  in proceeds from stock issued under sharebased compensation plans helped fund the following 

 

total net receivables in creased 10  compared to december 31 2012  consistent with our fourth quarter sales growth days sales outstanding dso improved between periods to 281 days at december 31 2013  compared to 288 days at december 31 2012  

inventory levels grew 7  to 4292 million  at december 31 2013  compared to levels at december 31 2012  our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis were 34 times at both december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  

total debt outstanding at december 31 2013  was  2464 million  an in crease of 155 million  from the balance at december 31 2012  

current trends and outlook 

2013 marked the fourth year of the gradual pool industry recovery following the great recession despite the sluggish pace of recovery pent up demand in north america for replacement and refurbishment of existing pools and pool components helped propel industry growth this growth occurred despite inclement weather throughout many primarily seasonal markets which adversely impacted pool openings and demand for maintenance products irrigation and landscape markets also benefited from the continuing recovery of singlefamily home construction markets 

the economic downturn between 2007 and 2009 had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000  new units in 2009 to approximately 60000  new units in 2013 construction levels are still down more than 70  compared to peak levels in 2005 and down approximately 60 from what we consider normal levels 

the rebound in our base business sales growth beginning in 2010 reflects continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures higher replacement activities and market share gains given our estimated industry growth of 3 to 5 for 2010 to 2012 improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence employment housing consumer financing and economic expansion helped support this growth in 2013 we estimate industry growth dipped temporarily to approximately 1 to 2 given the impact of adverse weather on seasonal markets going forward we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity and our expectation for gradually normalized new pool and irrigation construction levels we also expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 7 over this time period before reverting back to 3 to 4 annual growth over the longer term as current economic trends indicate that consumer spending has begun to slowly recover and that construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

for 2014 we expect the macroeconomic environment and the opportunities to realize additional market share gains will be quite similar to 2013 we also anticipate industry growth levels will benefit from an expected return to normal seasonal weather compared to 2013 we project 6 to 8 base business sales growth including our expectation for average inflationary product cost increases of 1 to 2 we expect that we will grow market share by providing exceptional customer service throughout our networks expanding product lines and further penetrating underserved markets we also expect to modestly expand our pool and irrigation networks by opening seven to nine new locations we believe our sales growth will be more geographically balanced than 2013 and will continue to be weighted toward sales of discretionary products resulting in negative to neutral gross margin trends for the full year 

overall we anticipate expenses will grow at approximately half the rate of our net sales growth in 2014 reflecting inflationary increases and incremental costs to support our sales growth expectations we expect base business results will generate operating profit growth of 15 or greater in 2014 

based on these expectations we project that 2014 earnings per share will be approximately 235 to 245 per diluted share we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2014  and anticipate that share repurchase activity will be similar to 2013 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging these reserves range from 01 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 02  of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales were 01  in 2013  01  in 2012  and 02  in 2011  the recent improvement in net writeoffs reflects gradually improving external market trends and heightened collection efforts and creditworthiness evaluations we expect that writeoffs will be approximately 01  of net sales in 2014  at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend allowance for doubtful accounts balance to i current year writeoffs and ii any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2013  pretax income would change by approximately 09 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 001  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2013  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity sales centers classify products into 13 classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months or 36 months for tile products 

all inventory is included in these classes except for nonstock special order items and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 



there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors at the end of each fiscal year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior yearend obsolescence reserve balance to i current year inventory writeoffs and ii the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory  based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2013  pretax income would change by approximately 14 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 002  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2013  

vendor incentives 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor incentives as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors 

we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor incentive arrangements are based on calendar year periods our estimates for these arrangements are updated at year end to reflect actual annual purchase levels in the first quarter of the subsequent year we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor incentives received to the prior year vendor incentive balances based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our vendor incentive estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our gross margins for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

each year we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns based on this hindsight analysis we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate 

as of december 31 2013  we have not provided for united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if these earnings are repatriated to the united states in the future or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation 

  

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions 

we have operations in 39  states 1  united states territory and 10  foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions assess the probability of examinations by taxing authorities and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

incentive compensation accrual 

our incentive compensation structure is designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share 

management sets the objectives for our bonus plans at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record an incentive compensation accrual at the end of each month using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved toward the stated bonus plan objectives during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

our quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year each year we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year end to determine the accuracy of our incentive compensation estimates based on our hindsight analysis we concluded that our incentive compensation accrual balance was within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

our largest intangible asset is goodwill at december 31 2013  our goodwill balance was 1720 million  representing approximately 21  of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center as of october 1 2013  we had 208  reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the highest goodwill balance was 57 million  and the average goodwill balance was 08 million  

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows we project future cash flows using managements assumptions for sales growth rates operating margins discount rates and multiples these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value estimates we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

in october 2013  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level during the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis based on our identification of impairment indicators related to our results through the end of the 2012 pool season as a result of our interim impairment analysis in the third quarter of 2012 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 69 million equal to the total carrying amount of our united kingdom reporting unit 

based on the magnitude of their goodwill balances and the challenging economic conditions in europe we identified our italy and spain reporting units as the most at risk for goodwill impairment results for certain of our reporting units in quebec canada fell below expectations in 2013 due to weather and other execution challenges which prompted us to identify one reporting unit as atrisk we believe our domestic reporting units most at risk for goodwill impairment include one horizon location in texas one horizon location in nevada and one horizon location in california as of december 31 2013  our atrisk reporting units in europe had an aggregate goodwill balance of 64 million  our atrisk reporting unit in canada had a goodwill balance of 07 million and our atrisk reporting units in the united states had an aggregate goodwill balance of 32 million  

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting units discussed above impairment charges would decrease operating income negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium our fair value estimates fell within 1 of our market capitalization our sensitivity analysis which incorporated more conservative projected cash flow assumptions and fell close to 10 below our market capitalization resulted in no calculated goodwill impairments 

we performed a second sensitivity analysis over our two remaining key fair value assumptions and determined that a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate would generate fair value estimates significantly below our market capitalization evidencing that our estimates for these assumptions fell at the conservative end of a range of acceptable estimates 

recent accounting pronouncements 

we are not aware of any recent accounting pronouncements that will materially impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2013  2012  and 2011  we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2013  compared to fiscal year 2012   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



 

we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets from base business results for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers there was one sales center opened in a new market that was excluded from base business as of december 31 2013  

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2013  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales as well as base business sales increased 6 in 2013 the base business sales increase is comprised of a 6 increase from swimming pool product sales and an 11 increase from irrigation product sales in local currencies net sales in europe were relatively flat compared to 2012 reflecting the impact of cold and wet weather conditions on results over the first half of the year and the effects of the continued difficult economic environment 

the principal factors impacting our base business sales growth included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

sales of building materials and tile grew by 20 in 2013 compared to 2012 although collectively these products only accounted for approximately 11 of our total sales chemical sales declined by 15 reflecting lower volume due to delayed pool openings compared to 2012 while chemical pricing remained relatively flat 

we realized base business sales growth of 2 in the first quarter and 4 in the second quarter compared to the prior year periods throughout the first half of 2013 comparatively difficult weather versus the first half of 2012 suppressed our sales growth sales through may of 2012 benefited from unusually favorable weather especially across the eastern half of north america record warm temperatures in the northeast and midwest united states spurred an earlier than normal start to remodeling projects and new pool construction in the 2012 season in 2013 later than normal pool openings in our seasonal markets in north america and europe further added to these challenging comparisons weather normalized in the latter half of 2013 leading to base business sales growth of 9 in the third quarter and 11 in the fourth quarter see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  beginning on page 32  

gross profit 



gross margin declined approximately 60 basis points from last year this decrease is primarily due to unfavorable product mix customer mix and geographic mix as well as competitive pricing pressures doubledigit sales growth of higher value lower margin discretionary products such as variable speed pumps high efficiency heaters led lighting products irrigation systems and landscape equipment positively contributed to sales and gross profit dollars but negatively impacted our margins this growth outpaced our sales of higher margin nondiscretionary product lines generally associated with basic pool maintenance and repair activity additionally as a result of the slower start to the 2013 season geographic regions with generally higher margins contributed a proportionally smaller share of our total sales growth 

the following factors collectively impacted gross margin throughout 2013 

 

year over year gross margin comparisons fell below the prior year each quarter during 2013 with declines of 60 basis points in the first quarter 50 basis points in the second quarter 60 basis points in the third quarter and 90 basis points in the fourth quarter these declines reflect the changes in product and customer mix discussed above while geographic mix also contributed to the margin decline in the first and second quarters of 2013 the larger decline in the fourth quarter is due primarily to a more favorable impact on fourth quarter 2012 gross margins from certain vendor incentives 

operating expenses 



operating expenses as well as base business operating expenses increased 2 compared to 2012 increases in overall compensationrelated costs driven by inflationary salary increases and headcount increases to support new sales centers and higher professional fees were partially offset by a reduction in performancebased compensation

interest expense net for 2013 was consistent with 2012 average outstanding debt was 2561 million for 2013 versus 2503 million for 2012 the weighted average effective interest rate declined slightly to 24 in 2013 compared to 26 in 2012 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 3880 at december 31 2013 compared to 4100 at december 31 2012 excluding the impact of last years goodwill impairment charge our effective income tax rate for 2012 was 3980 the impact on the provision from the change in our valuation allowance for foreign net operating losses was 057 in 2013 compared to 197 in 2012 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 19  to 973 million  in 2013  compared to 820 million  in 2012  while earnings per share increased 20  to 205  per diluted share compared to 171  per diluted share in 2012  excluding the 69 million 014 per diluted share impact from the goodwill impairment charge in 2012 net income for 2013 increased 9  over 2012  adjusted net income of 889 million  while diluted eps increased 11  from adjusted diluted earnings per share of 185 for 2012  

earnings per share for 2013 also included an accretive impact of approximately 002 per diluted share from the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchase activities during the year 

fiscal year 2012  compared to fiscal year 2011   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



for an explanation of how we calculate base business please refer to the discussion of base business on pag e 26 unde r the heading fiscal year 2013  compared to fiscal year 2012  

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2012  to the year ended december 31 2011  we excluded acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below as of december 31 2012  we also excluded four new market sales center that opened in 2012  



 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2012  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales for 2012 increased 9 compared to 2011 including a 7 increase in base business sales and a 2 increase related to our recent acquisitions and sales centers opened in new markets our base business sales growth included a 7 increase on the swimming pool side of the business and a 10 increase on the irrigation side of the business in local currencies net sales in europe declined approximately 1 in 2012 as modest sales growth in france our largest european market offset double digit sales declines in the united kingdom and sales declines in spain and italy 

the principal factors contributing to base business sales growth included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

sales of building materials tile and packaged pool products grew by 16 compared to 2011 although collectively these products only accounted for approximately 12 of our total sales chemical sales grew by 5 with a small benefit overall from price inflation despite some lingering price deflation for certain chemical products 

these sales increases were offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 1 

our sales performance in 2012 was strongest in the first quarter with 13 base business sales growth modest in the middle second and third quarters and solid in the fourth quarter with 12 base business sales growth sales benefited from exceptionally favorable weather through may as record warm spring temperatures spawned an early start to the 2012 peak season however june and july sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions compared to the same period in 2011 and the shift of business into earlier months see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  beginning on page 32 

gross profit 



gross margin decreased 60 basis points between periods reflecting unfavorable changes in our product and customer mix competitive pricing pressures and unfavorable comparisons to 2011 which benefited from opportunistic inventory purchases as discussed above customer demand shifted somewhat in 2012 to higher value lower margin products while this product mix change strongly contributed to 2012 sales and gross profit growth it negatively impacted gross margin additionally going into the 2011 season we made greater early buy inventory purchases in advance of yearend vendor price increases and we made additional bulk inventory purchases in advance of midyear 2011 vendor price increases these strategic purchases benefited our gross margin throughout 2011 we made more modest early buy inventory purchases going into the 2012 season as vendor price increases were less escalated 

favorable impacts on comparative gross margin included continued improvements in purchasing and pricing discipline and a 10 basis point increase attributed to lower debit card fees as a percentage of net sales as a result of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

year over year gross margin comparisons worsened throughout 2012 with declines of 30 basis points in the first quarter 50 basis points in the second quarter 70 basis points in the third quarter and 90 basis points in the fourth quarter the gradual decline reflected the difficult comparison to 2011 due to the timing and amount of inventory purchases combined with changes in product and customer mix during 2012 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 3 compared to 2011 base business operating expenses remained essentially flat due to the following 

 

these declines were offset by increases of 41 million in salaries and wages and 21 million in employee insurance costs primarily due to a 3 increase in average headcount excluding acquisitions professional fees also increased by 25 million 

interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased 15 million due primarily to the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses with gains of 01 million recognized in 2012 compared to losses of 06 million recognized in 2011 interest expense related to borrowings declined approximately 03 million in 2012 due primarily to a decline in expense on interest rate swap contracts average outstanding debt was down 2 compared to 2011 and the weighted average effective interest rate remained flat at 26 between periods in 2011 we realized a 03 million loss related to the early termination of interest rate swap contracts in the fourth quarter 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 4100 at december 31 2012 compared to 3870 at december 31 2011 this slightly higher effective income tax rate reflects an increase in our valuation allowance and a small impact due to the temporary lapse of the controlled foreign corporation income exclusion offset by benefits realized upon the expiration of statutes of limitations for our 2007 income tax returns 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 14 to 820 million in 2012 while earnings per share increased 16 to 171 per diluted share excluding the 69 million 014 per diluted share impact from the goodwill impairment charge in 2012 and the 16 million 003 per diluted share impact from the goodwill impairment charge in 2011 adjusted net income for 2012 increased 21 to 889 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 23 to 185 per diluted share earnings per share for 2012 also included the following 

 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2013  we generated approximately 66  of our net sales and essentially 100  of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2013  and 2012  we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  



  

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 



more normalized weather in the first quarter of 2013 sharply contrasted with the mild winter experienced in the same period of 2012 in the first quarter of 2012 above average temperatures surfaced throughout the eastern half of north america with record warm temperatures in the northeast and the midwest more normal temperatures in 2013 resulted in delayed pool openings in comparison to 2012 which directly affected first quarter sales in most seasonal markets as evidenced by the sales growth variations between our yearround and seasonal markets our largest yearround swimming pool markets delivered growth of approximately 10 in the first quarter of 2013 whereas our more seasonal markets experienced close to 10 declines compared to the first quarter of 2012 weather turned unfavorable in the second quarter of 2013 with unusually cool and wet conditions in our seasonal markets we observed above normal precipitation across nearly the entire united states with the exception of california texas the southwest and the rockies below normal temperatures in the central and southeast united states and in europe differed significantly from the above normal temperatures experienced in the second quarter of 2012 these conditions resulted in even further delayed pool openings in comparison to last year which directly affected our second quarter sales in most seasonal markets weather trends in our seasonal markets largely normalized in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 resulting in sales growth rates in our seasonal markets to more closely align with sales growth rates in our largest yearround markets 

as discussed above weather favorably impacted sales in 2012 particularly in the first quarter favorable weather trends continued in the beginning of the second quarter with much higher than normal temperatures across the united states excluding the pacific northwest the three month period between march and may 2012 was the warmest on record both nationally and for 31 of the 37 states east of the rocky mountains the unusually mild winter and record warm spring led sales to shift into the first and early second quarter and resulted in the earlier than normal peak of the 2012 season june sales were negatively impacted by weather due to below normal temperatures across the southeast and cooler temperatures compared to 2011 in most markets excluding california and the southwest in the third and fourth quarters of 2012 weather conditions were favorable in most markets but comparable overall to the same period in 2011 

weather also had a moderately favorable impact on our operations in 2011 sales benefited from weather conditions in the southeast and southwest including record high temperatures in texas although this impact was partially offset by unfavorable conditions throughout the year on the west coast due to cooler than average temperatures in the first quarter of 2011 our sales benefited from much more favorable weather conditions across the sunbelt markets compared to the same period in 2010 sales in our north texas and oklahoma markets were also positively impacted by repair and replacement activity for freeze damaged pool equipment while our sales in the second quarter of 2011 benefited from above average temperatures across the southeast a slow start to the pool season in the midwest due to record precipitation levels and closer to average temperatures across the northeast resulted in some unfavorable comparisons to the same period in 2010 in the third quarter of 2011 we estimate that the weather impact on sales was neutral overall compared to both the same period in 2010 and longterm averages weather conditions were more favorable in the fourth quarter of 2011 with warmer temperatures across much of the eastern half of the country compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent debt structure and returning money to our shareholders our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

as discussed further under the subheading future sources and uses of cash  on page  35 we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under our debt agreements including the maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio although more conservative than the maximum we strive to maintain an average total leverage ratio of 150 to 200 while considering this metric we also use our cash to repurchase common stock based on boarddefined parameters and to repay our debt 

capital expenditures have historically averaged 05 to 10 of net sales capital expenditures were 09 of net sales in 2013 08 of net sales in 2012 and 11 of net sales in 2011 in 2011 following two to three years of limited capacity expansion capital expenditures were higher than the historical average because we began purchasing rather than leasing new vehicles and forklifts going forward we project capital expenditures to be near the high end of our historical range due to our continued investment in new vehicles equipment and technology 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations of  1051 million  in 2013  exceeded net income by  78 million  compared to 2012 cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to normal seasonal timing differences in working capital cash provided by operations in 2012 exceeded net income by 371 million and increased over 2011 primarily due to the increase in net income from 2011 and improved working capital management 

cash used in investing activities in 2013 declined compared to 2012 primarily due to lower acquisition payments the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to higher capital expenditures of 32 million in 2011 which included a few large information technology upgrades 

cash used in financing activities declined in 2013 due primarily to changes in our net borrowings offset by repurchases of our shares in the open market we had 155 million  of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2013  compared to net payments of 164 million  in 2012 in 2013 we repurchased 943 million  of shares on the open market up 173 million  compared to 2012 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to the change in net proceeds and payments on our debt arrangements we made 164 million of net payments on our debt arrangements in 2012 compared to 486 million of net borrowings in 2011 the activity in 2012 for proceeds and payments on our debt arrangements included the payoff of our 1000 million floating rate senior notes at maturity on february 12 2012 also on october 19 2011 we entered into a new 4300 million unsecured syndicated senior revolving credit facility the credit facility since the credit facility replaced and refinanced the outstanding balances under our 2400 million unsecured senior revolving credit facility the previous revolver proceeds from and payments on revolving lines of credit in 2011 reflected the 1615 million payoff of the previous revolver in 2012 we repurchased 770 million of shares on the open market up 60 million compared to 2011 

future sources and uses of cash 

as amended on september 20 2013 our credit facility provides for 4650 million in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 5400 million the credit facility matures on september 20 2018 we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2013  there was 1944 million  outstanding and 2674 million  available for borrowing under the credit facility we currently have five interest rate swap contracts in place that reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the credit facility these swap contracts convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 1185 on notional amounts totaling 500 million 1100 on a notional amount of 500 million 1050 on a notional amount of 250 million and 0990 on a notional amount of 250 million interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swaps is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility all five swap agreements will terminate on october 19 2016 the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2013  was approximately 21  excluding commitment fees 

financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2013  the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 

the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends additionally we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50 limit described above so long as i the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50 limit and ii our average total leverage ratio is less than 300 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice 

under the credit facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness 

make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in penalty payments higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

on october 11 2013 we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new twoyear accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility with a peak seasonal funding capacity of up to 1200 million between march 1 and august 31 and up to 800 million between september 1 and february 28 an additional seasonal facility limit of up to 400 million may be available between april 1 and june 30 we decided to employ this arrangement because it provides us with a lower cost form of financing 

the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary the securitization subsidiary the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds limited to the applicable funding capacities upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due 

the receivables facility contains terms and conditions including representations covenants and conditions precedent customary for transactions of this type additionally an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio average total funded debtebitda of 325 to 100 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio ebitdarcash interest expense plus rental expense of 225 to 100 

at december 31 2013  there was 520 million  outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 09 

as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2014  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 21 2014  704 million  of the current boardauthorized amount under our share repurchase program remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares on the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2013  our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 



for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments in thousands related to our longterm debt obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2013  outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2013  for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swaps to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility and the receivables facility 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2013  there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts for the credit facility the portion of our outstanding balance under the credit facility that was not covered by our interest rate swap contracts and the receivables facility were both subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2013  related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under the credit facility excluding the accordion feature and the offseason maximum amount available under the receivables facility in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility and the receivables facility increased 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 31 million  and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 004  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2013  the maximum amount available under the credit facility is 4650 million  excluding the 750 million  accordion feature and the maximum amount available under the receivables facility is 1200 million  excluding the 400 million  seasonal increase in capacity available from april to june 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom belgium france germany italy portugal spain mexico and colombia based on the functional currencies for these international subsidiaries as shown in the table below changes in exchange rates for these currencies may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 89  of total net sales in 2013  our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2014  and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

based on industry data pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us  or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2012  we operated 312  sales centers in north america and europe through our three distribution networks 

 

superior and horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of scp which is wholly owned by pool corporation 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 80 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 12  currently have a pool there are also significant growth opportunities in pool remodeling due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools and pool equipment replacement due to technological advancements and more energy‑efficient products the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it will realize longterm growth rates similar to the pool industry 

favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

 

approximately 60  of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance related goods and certain discretionary products 

  

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic along with relatively consistent rates of inflationary price increases averaging 1 to 2 that have been passed on by manufacturers and distributors has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market have adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities 

the following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground and aboveground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2011 pk data inc reports 

the replacement and refurbishment market includes major swimming pool remodeling and currently accounts for close to 30 of consumer spending in the pool industry this activity is based on the aging of the installed base of pools with the timing of expenditures being more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of the remaining consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and landscape products for aesthetic environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market irrigation and landscape maintenance activities account for approximately 40  of total spending in the irrigation industry with the remaining 60  of spending related to irrigation construction and other discretionary related products as such our irrigation business is more heavily weighted toward new construction activities and the sale of discretionary related products compared to our pool business and is therefore more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments and equipment replacement we believe that over the long term housing turnover and single family home value appreciation are the best indicators of new pool construction with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence gdp and unemployment 

the economic downturn between 2007 and 2009 had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000  new units in 2009  to approximately 60000  new units in 2012  it is still down more than 70 compared to peak levels in 2005 and down approximately 60 from what we consider to be normalized levels 

our base business sales growth in 2011 and 2012 was driven primarily by market share gains but also reflected continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures and higher replacement activities given our estimated industry growth of 3 to 4 each year although general external market factors including consumer confidence employment consumer financing and economic growth have improved we believe the current economic environment remains uncertain especially in europe due to the lingering sovereign debt and economic issues 

we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity and our expectation for gradually normalized new pool and irrigation construction levels we also expect that market conditions will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 7 to 10 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 7 over this time period before reverting back to 3 to 5 annual growth over the longer term 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can delay or accelerate the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

  

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are as follows 

 

we promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industry oriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ® public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives including social media we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures direct mail marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection store layout and design business management system implementation comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes 

growth initiatives related to our various customer programs include our retail brand licensing program and our rewards program designed for pool service professionals under our brand licensing program customers make commitments to meet minimum purchase levels stock a minimum of nine specific product categories and operate within certain guidelines including weekend hour requirements our rewards program aligns with our replacement parts growth initiative and provides customers with monthly coupons and other special discounts on parts product purchases in addition to these programs we also feature consumer showrooms in over 70 of our sales centers and host an annual retail summit 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management other key internal growth initiatives include the continued expansion of both our product offerings as described in the “customers and products” section below and our distribution networks 

we have grown our distribution networks through acquisitions new sales center openings and the expansion of existing sales centers since the beginning of 2008  we completed 12  acquisitions consisting of 33  sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition these acquired locations included six sales centers added to our international scp network ahead of the 2012  season including one sales center in germany four sales centers in british columbia canada and one sales center in ontario canada given the more stabilized external environment we have increased our focus on new sales center openings including satellite locations that enable us to more effectively serve customers in existing markets we opened 9  new sales centers in 2012  and we expect to open between 7  and 10  new sales centers in 2013  

we plan to continue to selectively expand our swimming pool and irrigation distribution networks via both acquisitions and new sales center openings we plan to make strategic acquisitions to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically including the period between 2007 and 2009 when our industry contracted and that these market share gains continued in 2011 and 2012 going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 2 annually in our industry over the past 10 years we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in 2012 we estimate that price inflation was consistent with the historical average while in 2011 price inflation was approximately 2 we anticipate price inflation will vary some by product lines but will approximate the longterm average overall in 2013 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 80000  customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve five types of customers 

 

the majority of these customers are small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources the recent economic environment has had the greatest impact on swimming pool remodelers and builders and landscape construction companies we have seen a modest contraction in our customer base in these segments over the last several years 

we conduct our operations through 312  sales centers in north america and europe our primary markets with the highest concentration of swimming pools are california texas florida and arizona representing approximately 50  of our net sales in 2012  we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 160000  national brand and pool corporation branded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

  

 

we track and monitor the majority of our sales by product lines and categories to provide support for sales and marketing efforts and for consideration in incentive plan programs we currently have over 400  product lines and over 50 product categories based on our 2012  product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 15  in 2012  16  in 2011  and 17  in 2010  while market share gains drove chemical volume growth of 4  in 2012 and 6  in 2011 chemical sales growth did not keep pace with our overall sales growth due to price deflation of approximately 2  in 2011 and lingering price deflation for certain chemical products in 2012 no other product category accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we categorize our maintenance repair and replacement products into the following two groupings 

 

in 2012 the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for approximately 60 of our sales and gross profits while approximately 40 of sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of swimming pools this reflected a shift back toward more sales of major refurbishment and replacement products due to the modest recovery of these activities since levels reached a low point in 2009 between 2005 and early 2010 sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction prior to this industry downturn just over 50 of our total sales and gross profits were related to maintenance and minor repair products 

since our acquisition of national pool tile npt in 2008 we have expanded the number of sales center locations that offer npt tile and composite pool finish products from the original 14  locations to over 70 locations these locations feature consumer showrooms where swimming pool dealers and homeowners can view and select pool components including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades another key product initiative has been the expansion of our replacement parts offerings these product initiatives along with the continued expansion of our pool corporation branded products have contributed to gross margin improvements over time throughout 2012 we experienced product and customer mix changes particularly related to sales growth in higher value lower margin products such as variable speed pumps motorized pool lifts and pool heaters we also observed faster sales growth from larger lower margin customers our strategic plan considers how these recent trends can contribute to operating income growth over the next several years 

products related to pool construction and remodeling have been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth while sales of these products declined between 2007 and 2009 as the majority of these products are discretionary in nature we realized some sales growth in 2010 followed by double digit sales growth in 2011 and 2012 due to our ongoing expansion of these product offerings and the gradual improvement in new construction remodeling and economic trends we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets we then evaluate the performance in these test markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network while we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixed‑use zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

we also operate six  centralized shipping locations csls that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases directly to customers our csls are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and related construction products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to offer seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms typically allow us to place orders in the fall prior to any seasonal price increases take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors to optimize profitability and shareholder return we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 18  11  and 8  respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2012  

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of irrigation and landscape products we also face competition both directly and indirectly from massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers both storebased and internet who buy directly from manufacturers and to a lesser extent from other distributors 

some geographic markets we serve particularly the five largest and higher pool density markets of california florida texas arizona and new york have a greater concentration of competition than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3400  people at december 31 2012  given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200  to 500  employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of   1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forward‑looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward‑looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward‑looking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products has been and may continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for approximately 87 of our net sales and gross profits the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause consumers to defer discretionary replacement and refurbish activity in addition even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pool and irrigation systems the recent unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market have resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which has limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems if these trends continue or worsen many consumers will likely not be able to obtain financing for pool and irrigation projects which could negatively impact our sales of construction related products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions which could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations and negatively impact our sales while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the shortterm or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 18  11  and 8  respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2012  a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to retailers or enduse consumers could also adversely affect our business we dedicate considerable resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe significantly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers large pool or landscape supply retailers and internet retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california texas florida and arizona representing approximately 50  of our net sales in 2012  also tend to be more competitive than others 

more aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through acquisitions market share gains and new sales center openings that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since the beginning of 2008  we completed 12 acquisitions consisting of 33  sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2012  approximately 66  of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of both swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and landscape installations and maintenance our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell and distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase the risk of claims may also be greater with respect to products manufactured by thirdparty suppliers outside the united states particularly in china uncertainties with respect to foreign legal systems may adversely affect us in resolving claims arising from our foreign sourced products even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and our company 

for foreign sourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that would prevent us from obtaining products and there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

  

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporate offices which consist of approximately 53000  square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50  ownership interest we own three  sales center facilities in florida and one  in texas we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three  to seven  year terms 

as of december 31 2012  we had 11  leases with remaining terms longer than seven  years that expire between 2020  and 2027  most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000  square feet to 60000  square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls range in size from approximately 34000  square feet to 78000  square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including product liability personal injury commercial contract and employment matters litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 

as previously disclosed in our form 10q filed on july 27 2012 a number of purported antitrust class action suits have been filed against us in various united states district courts the cases were transferred and consolidated before the judicial panel for multidistrict litigation mdl docket no 2328 and are presently pending in the eastern district of louisiana on june 14 2012 indirect purchaser plaintiffs purporting to represent indirect purchasers of swimming pool products in arizona california florida and missouri filed a first amended class action complaint on september 5 2012 they filed a second amended complaint on june 29 2012 direct purchaser plaintiffs who are current or former customers filed a consolidated amended class action complaint which added three defendants hayward industries inc pentair water pool and spa inc and zodiac pool systems inc the amended complaints seek unspecified compensatory and enhanced damages interest costs and fees and other equitable relief we believe the amended complaints are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals as previously disclosed in our form 10q filed on july 27 2012 in the second quarter of 2012 the office of the district attorney for the county of riverside california made a monetary demand upon us for civil penalties alleging noncompliance in the past with local and state hazardous waste handling storage and transportation laws fire and building code regulations and california business  professions code section 17200 primarily relating to liquid chlorine and muriatic acid we are engaged in discussions with riverside county regarding resolution of these matters but we are unable to predict the outcome based on information currently available to us we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable based on currently available facts we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters or other claims and litigation not discussed above will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and related events unfold

2012 financial overview 

financial results 

solid performance in 2012 produced record results surpassing our objectives net sales increased 9 compared to 2011 including a 7 increase in base business sales base business sales growth was driven by market share gains continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures growth in the installed base of pools and some price inflation partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations of approximately 1 

gross profit increased 7 compared to 2011 while gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 290 this decrease reflects unfavorable product and customer mix changes and competitive pricing pressures gross margin in 2012 was also comparatively lower than 2011 gross margin due to the benefits realized in 2011 from opportunistic inventory purchases 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses for 2012 increased 3 with base business operating expenses essentially flat year over year decreases in employee incentive costs lower bad debt expense and the impact of currency fluctuations were offset by higher professional fees and increases in wages and employee insurance 

during the third quarter of 2012 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 69 million equal to the total goodwill carrying amount of our united kingdom reporting unit this impairment charge had a 014 negative impact on diluted eps for the year ended december 31 2012 since this goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 was higher than normal during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 16 million resulting from our annual goodwill impairment analysis this impairment charge had a 003 negative impact on diluted eps for the year ended december 31 2011 

operating income for the year improved 16 while operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin increased 40 basis points to 74 excluding goodwill impairment in both years adjusted operating income for 2012 increased 20 and adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 78 for the year ended december 31 2012 net interest expense decreased 15 million due to the impacts of changes in estimated interest expense related to uncertain tax positions and foreign currency translation gains and losses 

net income increased 14 compared to 2011 while earnings per share was up 16 to 171 per diluted share adjusted net income for 2012 increased 21 and adjusted eps was up 23 to 185 per diluted share 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations of  1191 million  in 2012  was  302 million  more than adjusted net income and combined with  836 million  in net proceeds from our revolving line of credit and  202 million  in proceeds from stock issued under sharebased compensation plans helped fund the following 

 

total net receivables increased 4 compared to december 31 2011  due primarily to an increase in current trade receivables as a result of december base business sales growth higher vendor receivables and a slight reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts days sales outstanding dso improved between periods to 288 days at december 31 2012  compared to 299 days at december 31 2011  

inventory levels were up 3 to 4003 million at december 31 2012  compared to levels at december 31 2011  excluding inventory of approximately 40 million from recent acquisitions inventories increased 2 year over year our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis accelerated to 34 times at december 31 2012  from 32 times at december 31 2011  

total debt outstanding was 2309 million  at december 31 2012  a decrease of 164 million  compared to december 31 2011  

current trends and outlook 

the economic downturn between 2007 and 2009 had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000  new units in 2009 to approximately 60000  new units in 2012 construction levels are still down more than 70  compared to peak levels in 2005 and down approximately 60 from what we consider normalized levels 

our base business sales growth in 2012 and 2011 was driven by market share gains but also reflected continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures and higher replacement activities given our estimated industry growth of 3 to 4 each year although general external market factors including consumer confidence employment housing consumer financing and economic growth have improved we believe the current economic environment remains uncertain especially in europe due to lingering sovereign debt and economic issues 

looking ahead we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and remodeling activity and our expectation for gradually normalized new pool and irrigation construction levels we also expect that market conditions will continue to improve enabling further recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 7 to 10 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 7 over this time period before reverting back to 3 to 5 annual growth over the longer term we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

our outlook for 2013 is very similar to 2012 with regard to the macroeconomic environment industry growth levels and opportunities for us to realize additional market share gains we anticipate 5 to 7 base business sales growth including our expectation for average inflationary product cost increases of 1 to 2 we believe that unfavorable product and customer mix changes and competitive pricing trends will continue in 2013 therefore improved purchasing and pricing discipline will be key to realizing any gross margin improvement in 2013 as such we expect that our gross margin will remain relatively flat for the full year with quarterly gross margin comparisons versus 2012 varying by 30 or more basis points 

base business operating expenses were essentially flat versus 2011 as decreases in employee incentive costs lower bad debt expense and the impact of currency fluctuations were offset by higher professional fees and increases in wages and employee insurance overall we anticipate more normalized levels of expense growth in 2013 including inflationary increases and some incremental costs to support our sales growth expectations with operating expense growth at about half the rate of sales growth we expect base business results will generate operating profit growth as a percentage of base business sales growth contribution margin at or approaching 20 in 2013 

based on these expectations we project that 2013 earnings per share will be approximately 213 to 223 per diluted share we expect cash provided by operations will exceed net income for fiscal 2013  and anticipate that share repurchase activity will be similar to 2012 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from 01 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 03  of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales were 01  in 2012  02  in 2011  and 03  in 2010  writeoffs in 2010 were higher than our longterm historical average of approximately 02 of net sales due to the negative impacts on some of our customers businesses from the challenging external environment between 2007 and 2010 based on significant reductions in our past due receivables aging categories due to gradually improving external market trends heightened collection efforts and creditworthiness evaluations net writeoffs improved significantly in 2011 and 2012 we expect that writeoffs will be approximately 01  of net sales in 2013  

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2012  pretax income would change by approximately 11 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 001  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2012  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volumes at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity sales centers classify products into 13 classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months or 36 months for tile products 

all inventory is included in these classes except for nonstock special order items and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 



there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2012  pretax income would change by approximately 15 million  and earnings per share would change by approximately 002  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2012  

vendor incentives 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor incentives as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our gross margins for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2012  we have not provided for united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if these earnings are repatriated to the united states in the future or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation 

  

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions 

we have operations in 39  states 1  united states territory and 9  foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we regularly evaluate our tax positions assess the probability of examinations by taxing authorities and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

incentive compensation accrual 

our incentive compensation structure is designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year 

management sets the objectives for our bonus plans at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record an incentive compensation accrual at the end of each month using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved toward the stated bonus plan objectives during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

our quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

impairment of goodwill 

our largest intangible asset is goodwill at december 31 2012  our goodwill balance was 1700 million  representing approximately 22  of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units has fallen below their carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center as of october 1 2012  we had 209  reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the highest goodwill balance was 57 million  and the average goodwill balance was 08 million  

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing a present value model that incorporates our assumptions for projected future cash flows discount rates and multiples in order to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value estimates we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

during the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis based on our identification of impairment indicators related to our results through the end of the 2012 pool season and the depressed economic conditions in the united kingdom our results for the nine months ended september 30 2012 were significantly lower than our 2012 sales gross profit and operating profit estimates for the united kingdom reporting unit that we used in our 2011 annual goodwill impairment test we updated our 2011 impairment analysis for both our actual 2012 year to date results and our updated growth estimates for future years based on expectations for a more prolonged economic recovery period in the united kingdom our updated projections had a significant impact on our projected future cash flow calculation and resulted in a much lower estimated fair value for our united kingdom reporting unit consequently we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 69 million  equal to the total carrying amount of our united kingdom reporting unit 

in october 2012  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 

based on the combination of their higher goodwill balances and the overall economic conditions and uncertainty in europe we identified our spain and italy reporting units as the most at risk for goodwill impairment we believe that our domestic reporting units most at risk for goodwill impairment are the three horizon locations in texas that had a recorded goodwill impairment in 2011 other domestic reporting units considered at risk for goodwill impairment include two additional horizon locations in texas one horizon location in nevada and one superior location in new jersey that each had marginal results in recent years but improved profitability in 2012 as of december 31 2012  our european at risk reporting units had an aggregate goodwill balance of 64 million  and our domestic at risk reporting units had an aggregate goodwill balance of 95 million  

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting units discussed above additional impairment charges would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet we performed a sensitivity test for the two key assumptions in our 2012 annual goodwill impairment test and determined that an increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital of 50 basis points or a decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate of 50 basis points would not hav e resulted in any calculated g oodwill impairments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance to give more prominence to items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci the new standard requires companies to disclose the effect on each income statement line item due to the reclassification of an aoci component into net income or if the reclassification does not impact net income the applicable accounting guidance and related financia l statement effects this standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 we expect that the adoption of this guidance will impact our financial statement disclosures but will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 





our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2012  2011  and 2010  we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2012  compared to fiscal year 2011   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 



 

we exclude sales centers that are acquired closed or opened in new markets from base business results for a period of 15 months we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers there were four sales centers opened in new markets that were excluded from base business as of december 31 2012  

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2012  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales for 2012 increased 9 compared to 2011 including a 7 increase in base business sales and a 2 increase related to our recent acquisitions and sales centers opened in new markets our base business sales growth included a 7 increase on the swimming pool side of the business and a 10 increase on the irrigation side of the business in local currencies net sales in europe declined approximately 1 in 2012 as modest sales growth in france our largest european market offset double digit sales declines in the united kingdom and sales declines in spain and italy 

the principal factors contributing to base business sales growth included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

sales of building materials tile and packaged pool products grew by 16 compared to 2011 although collectively these products only accounted for approximately 12 of our total sales chemical sales grew by 5 with a small benefit overall from price inflation despite some lingering price deflation for certain chemical products 

these sales increases were offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 1 

our sales performance in 2012 was strongest in the first quarter with 13 base business sales growth modest in the middle second and third quarters and solid in the fourth quarter with 12 base business sales growth sales benefited from exceptionally favorable weather through may as record warm spring temperatures spawned an early start to the 2012 peak season however june and july sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions compared to the same period in 2011 and the shift of business into earlier months see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  beginning on page 30 

gross profit 



gross margin decreased 60 basis points between periods reflecting unfavorable changes in our product and customer mix competitive pricing pressures and unfavorable comparisons to 2011 which benefited from opportunistic inventory purchases as discussed above customer demand shifted somewhat in 2012 to higher value lower margin products while this product mix change strongly contributed to 2012 sales and gross profit growth it negatively impacted gross margin additionally going into the 2011 season we made greater early buy inventory purchases in advance of yearend vendor price increases and we made additional bulk inventory purchases in advance of midyear 2011 vendor price increases these strategic purchases benefited our gross margin throughout 2011 we made more modest early buy inventory purchases going into the 2012 season as vendor price increases were less escalated 

favorable impacts on comparative gross margin included continued improvements in purchasing and pricing discipline and a 10 basis point increase attributed to lower debit card fees as a percentage of net sales as a result of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

year over year gross margin comparisons worsened throughout 2012 with declines of 30 basis points in the first quarter 50 basis points in the second quarter 70 basis points in the third quarter and 90 basis points in the fourth quarter the gradual decline reflected the difficult comparison to 2011 due to the timing and amount of inventory purchases combined with changes in product and customer mix during 2012 

operating expenses 



operating expenses increased 3 compared to 2011 base business operating expenses remained essentially flat due to the following 

 

these declines were offset by increases of 41 million in salaries and wages and 21 million in employee insurance costs primarily due to a 3 increase in average headcount excluding acquisitions professional fees also increased by 25 million 

interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased 15 million due primarily to the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses with gains of 01 million recognized in 2012 compared to losses of 06 million recognized in 2011 interest expense related to borrowings declined approximately 03 million in 2012 due primarily to a decline in expense on interest rate swap contracts average outstanding debt was down 2 compared to 2011 and the weighted average effective interest rate remained flat at 26 between periods in 2011 we realized a 03 million loss related to the early termination of interest rate swap contracts in the fourth quarter 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 4100 at december 31 2012 compared to 3870 at december 31 2011 this slightly higher effective income tax rate reflects an increase in our valuation allowance and a small impact due to the temporary lapse of the controlled foreign corporation income exclusion offset by benefits realized upon the expiration of statutes of limitations for our 2007 income tax returns 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 14 to 820 million in 2012 while earnings per share increased 16 to 171 per diluted share excluding the 69 million 014 per diluted share impact from the goodwill impairment charge in 2012 and the 16 million 003 per diluted share impact from the goodwill impairment charge in 2011 adjusted net income for 2012 increased 21 to 889 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 23 to 185 per diluted share earnings per share for 2012 also included the following 

 

fiscal year 2011  compared to fiscal year 2010   

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 



for an explanation of how we calculate base business please refer to the discussion of base business on page 24 under the heading fiscal year 2012  compared to fiscal year 2011  

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2011  to the year ended december 31 2010  we excluded acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below as of december 31 2011  we also excluded one existing sales center that was consolidated with an acquired sales center and one new market sales center that opened in 2011  



 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2011  



for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 



net sales for 2011 increased 11 compared to 2010 including a 10 increase in base business sales and a 1 increase related to our recent acquisitions and new sales centers our base business sales growth included a 10 increase on the swimming pool side of the business and an 8 increase on the irrigation side of the business the principal driver of base business sales growth was market share gains which we attributed to continued improvements in customer service levels benefits from our focus on the building materials product segment and retail customer segment of our industry and further expansion of our product offerings other factors contributing to the sales growth included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

one example of our success in achieving market share gains was the 18 sales growth for our building material products which include tile and specialty pool finish products the impact of double digit sales growth rates for products related to replacement and remodel activity was partially offset by lower growth rates for maintenance and repair products chemical sales grew 4 compared to 2010 with volumes up close to 6 and an unfavorable impact of 2 from price deflation on certain chemical products 

we realized more moderate sales growth rates in the last nine months of 2011 compared to the 15 base business sales growth realized in the first quarter of 2011 which had easier sales comparisons to the same period in 2010 and benefited from more favorable weather conditions across most of the sunbelt markets compared to the first quarter of 2010 see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  beginning on page 30 

gross profit 



gross margin increased 40 basis points between periods reflecting continued improvements in sales pricing and purchasing discipline this included a continued migration of sales to higher margin preferred vendor and pool corporation branded products and some benefit attributed to the impact of mid‑year vendor price increases implemented by some vendors we realized a favorable impact of 10 basis points related to higher freight out income which compensated for higher delivery costs included in operating expenses in 2011 we also experienced a more normalized competitive pricing environment in some markets compared to the past few years when our industry contracted 

year over year gross margin comparisons varied by quarter with improvements of 90 basis points in the seasonally slower first quarter 50 basis points in the second quarter and 60 basis points in the third quarter compared to a decline of 60 basis points in the fourth quarter the majority of the improvement in the first quarter was due to an easier comparison to the first quarter of 2010 when our gross margin was down 110 basis points from the first quarter of 2009 fourth quarter margins were down due primarily to the favorable impact on fourth quarter 2010 gross margin from certain non‑recurring vendor incentives 

operating expenses 



total operating expenses increased 10 compared to 2010 including an 8 increase in base business operating expenses due primarily to the following   

 

the only significant base business expense reduction compared to 2010 was a 21 million decline in facility lease costs which reflected the continued but moderating impact from lower negotiated lease rates and facility consolidations in 2010 and 2011 

interest expense net 

interest expense net increased 13 million due primarily to the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses with losses of 06 million recognized in 2011 compared to gains of 15 million recognized in 2010 interest expense related to borrowings declined approximately 07 million in 2011 despite a 03 million realized loss related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter the decline in interest expense on borrowings was due to a lower weighted average effective interest rate on 6 higher average debt compared to 2010 the weighted average effective interest rate decreased to 26 in 2011 from 30 in 2010 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 3870 at december 31 2011 and 3920 at december 31 2010 the decline in rates between years was due primarily to tax credits and other benefits realized in 2011 there were no significant changes in our estimates related to our income tax provision 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 25 to 720 million in 2011 while earnings per share increased 28 to 147 per diluted share this increase included accretive impacts of approximately 005 per diluted share from the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchase activities and approximately 002 per diluted share from favorable currency fluctuations in 2011 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2012  approximately 66  of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2012  and 2011  we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 



  



  

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 



overall we believe that weather favorably impacted sales in 2012 particularly in the first quarter our first quarter sales benefited from the unusually mild winter including record warm temperatures across the northeast and midwest favorable weather trends continued in the beginning of the second quarter with much higher than normal temperatures across the united states excluding the pacific northwest the three month period between march and may 2012 was the warmest on record both nationally and for 31 of the 37 states east of the rocky mountains the unusually mild winter and record warm spring led sales to shift into the first and early second quarter and resulted in the earlier than normal peak of the 2012 season june sales were negatively impacted by weather due to below normal temperatures across the southeast and cooler temperatures compared to 2011 in most markets excluding california and the southwest in the third and fourth quarters of 2012 weather conditions were favorable in most markets but comparable overall to the same period in 2011 

weather also had a moderately favorable impact on our operations in 2011 sales benefited from weather conditions in the southeast and southwest including record high temperatures in texas although this impact was partially offset by unfavorable conditions throughout the year on the west coast due to cooler than average temperatures in the first quarter of 2011 our sales benefited from much more favorable weather conditions across the sunbelt markets compared to the same period in 2010 sales in our north texas and oklahoma markets were also positively impacted by repair and replacement activity for freeze damaged pool equipment while our sales in the second quarter of 2011 benefited from above average temperatures across the southeast a slow start to the pool season in the midwest due to record precipitation levels and closer to average temperatures across the northeast resulted in some unfavorable comparisons to the same period in 2010 in the third quarter of 2011 we estimate that the weather impact on sales was neutral overall compared to both the same period in 2010 and longterm averages weather conditions were more favorable in the fourth quarter of 2011 with warmer temperatures across much of the eastern half of the country compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 

  

our first quarter 2010 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions across the sunbelt markets between january and midmarch including record cold weather in florida and much colder than average temperatures across the rest of the southeast however warmer weather in these regions during the latter half of march and near record warm temperatures in march across our markets in the northeast and canada helped drive a late rebound in our daily sales rates and flat base business sales overall for march compared to the same period in 2009 sales in our second and third quarters of 2010 benefited from much more favorable weather conditions across the southeast midwest and northeast compared to the same periods in 2009 including record or near record high temperatures across the eastern half of the united states and our markets in canada during the second quarter of 2010 however this benefit was largely offset by the adverse impact from unseasonably cool weather along the west coast throughout the 2010 pool season most notably in california our largest market 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent debt structure and returning money to our shareholders our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

as discussed further under the subheading future sources and uses of cash  on page 33 we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under our credit facility including the maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio although more conservative than the maximum we strive to maintain an average total leverage ratio of 150 to 200 while considering this metric we also use our cash to repurchase common stock based on board‑defined parameters and repay our debt 

capital expenditures which historically have averaged 05 to 10 of net sales were below and at the bottom of this range between 2008 and 2010 due to lower capacity expansion in 2011 capital expenditures increased to 11 of net sales since we began purchasing rather than leasing new vehicles and forklifts in 2012 capital expenditures were 08 of net sales going forward we project capital expenditures will be relatively consistent with our historical average 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 



cash provided by operations in 2012 exceeded net income by 371 million compared to the prior year cash provided by operations increased primarily due to the increase in net income and improved working capital management the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a 32 million decline in capital expenditures compared to 2011 which included a few large information technology upgrade projects 

cash used in financing activities increased during 2012 due primarily to the change in net proceeds and payments on our debt arrangements based on the year over year improvement in cash provided by operations we made 164 million of net payments on our debt arrangements in 2012 compared to 486 million of net borrowings in 2011 the activity for proceeds and payments on our debt arrangements included the payoff of our 1000 million floating rate senior notes at maturity on february 12 2012 proceeds from common stock issued under our sharebased compensation plans increased by 71 million compared to 2011 due to a higher weighted average exercise price on 2012 stock option exercises higher cash dividend payments reflected the 002 per share increase in our quarterly dividend beginning in the second quarter of 2012 we repurchased 770 million of shares on the open market in 2012 up 60 million compared to 2011 

cash provided by operations in 2011 exceeded net income by 31 million but declined versus 2010 due primarily to our drawdown of inventories in 2010 and the impact of higher comparative inventory levels in 2011 the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2010 reflected higher capital expenditures which included a few large information technology upgrade projects and an impact of approximately 61 million related to purchasing rather than leasing new vehicles and forklifts in 2011 cash used in financing activities in 2011 reflected 486 million of net debt borrowings which helped fund 710 million of share repurchases 

on october 19 2011 we entered into a new 4300 million unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility described further below since the credit facility replaced and refinanced the outstanding balances under our 2400 million unsecured revolving credit facility the previous revolver proceeds from and payments on revolving lines of credit in 2011 reflected the 1615 million payoff of the previous revolver 

future sources and uses of cash 

the credit facility provides for 4300 million in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 5050 million the credit facility matures on october 19 2016 we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives 

at december 31 2012  there was 2309 million  outstanding and 1955 million  available for borrowing under the credit facility we currently have five interest rate swap contracts in place that reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the credit facility these swap contracts convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 1185 on notional amounts totaling 500 million 1100 on a notional amount of 500 million 1050 on a notional amount of 250 million and 0990 on a notional amount of 250 million interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swaps is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility all five swap agreements will terminate on october 19 2016 the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2012  was approximately 22  excluding commitment fees 

financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2012  the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 

the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice under the credit facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in penalty payments higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2013  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 20 2013  895 million  of the current boardauthorized amount under our share repurchase program remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares on the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit facility 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2012  our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 



for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments related to our longterm debt obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2012  outstanding debt balances using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2012  for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swaps to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity date of the credit facility 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10‑k 

in 2012  there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swap contracts for the credit facility the portion of our outstanding balance under the credit facility that was not covered by our interest rate swap contracts was subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2012  related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under the credit facility excluding the accordion feature in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for the credit facility increased 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 30 million  and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 004  per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2012  the maximum amount available under the credit facility is 4300 million  excluding the 750 million  accordion feature 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom belgium france germany italy portugal spain and mexico based on the functional currencies for these international subsidiaries as shown in the table below changes in exchange rates for these currencies may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 94  of total net sales in 2012  our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2013  and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

based on industry data pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2011 we operated 298 sales centers in north america and europe through our three distribution networks 

 

 

 

superior and horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of scp which is wholly owned by pool corporation 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 80 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 12 currently have a pool we believe favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and will continue to do so in the long term these favorable trends include the following 

 

 

 

 

the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it benefits from the same favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends and will realize longterm growth rates similar to the pool industry 

approximately 70 of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance related goods and certain discretionary products 

 

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this characteristic along with relatively consistent rates of inflationary price increases averaging 1 to 3 that have been passed on by manufacturers and distributors has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market have adversely impacted pool construction and major repair and refurbishment activities 

 

  

  

the table below reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground and aboveground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2010 pk data inc reports 

  

      

the replacement and refurbishment market includes major swimming pool repairs and currently accounts for approximately 20 of consumer spending in the pool industry this activity is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of the remaining 10 of consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and landscape products for environmental safety or other reasons 

the irrigation and landscape distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market irrigation and landscape maintenance activities account for 40 of total spending in the irrigation industry with the remaining 60 of spending related to irrigation construction and other discretionary related products as such our irrigation business is more heavily weighted towards the sale of discretionary related products compared to our pool business and is therefore more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending 

certain trends in the housing market the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments and equipment replacement we believe that similar to trends for other home improvement expenditures there is a direct correlation between industry starts and the rate of single family housing turnover and home appreciation over time with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems similar to other discretionary purchases replacement and refurbishment activities are more impacted by economic factors such as gdp unemployment and inflation 

the adverse housing and economic trends over the past several years had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000 new units in 2009 to approximately 57000 new units in 2011 it is still down approximately 70 compared to peak levels although general external market factors including consumer confidence employment consumer financing and economic growth remain at depressed levels these factors have shown some improvement and we believe our 2 base business sales growth in 2010 and 10 base business sales growth in 2011 indicates that most pool markets are growing again and consumers have started to catch up on purchases deferred during the downturn 

  

  

  

  

trends have also improved on the irrigation side of our business with slowly moderating sales declines in 2010 followed by 8 base business sales growth in 2011 driven primarily by market share gains since irrigation is more heavily weighted toward new construction activities and there has not been any meaningful recovery in the housing market growth rates for this side of our business will probably continue to lag the swimming pool side of the business 

we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and retrofit activity and our expectation for gradually normalized new pool and irrigation construction levels we also expect that market conditions will continue to improve enabling the recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 8 to 10 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 8 over this time period before reverting back to 3 to 5 annual growth over the longer term 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can delay or accelerate the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are as follows 

 

 

 

we promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industry oriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives including social media we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with everything from site selection to store layout and design to business management system implementation 

growth initiatives related to our customer programs include our retail brand licensing program called the backyard place® and our pool pro 1 rewards program designed for pool service professionals we launched the backyard place® program in 2006 under this program customers make commitments to meet minimum purchase levels stock a minimum of nine specific product categories and operate within the backyard place® guidelines including weekend hour requirements  our pool pro 1 program aligns with our replacement parts growth initiative and provides customers with monthly coupons and other special discounts on parts product purchases over 2300 pool service professionals are members of this program 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management other key internal growth initiatives include the continued expansion of both our product offerings as described in the “customers and products” section below and our distribution networks 

  

  

  

  

we have grown our distribution networks through acquisitions new sales center openings and expansions of existing sales centers since the beginning of 2007 we completed 11 acquisitions consisting of 29 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition these locations included seven sales centers added to the horizon network ahead of the 2011 season through our acquisitions of turf equipment supply co and the kilpatrick company inc we also added five sales centers to our international scp network ahead of the 2012 season including one sales center in germany through an acquisition completed in november 2011 and four sales centers in british columbia canada through an acquisition completed in february 2012 in 2011 we opened four new sales centers and consolidated three sales centers given the more stabilized external environment we expect to open five or more new sales centers in 2012 

we plan to continue to selectively expand our domestic and international swimming pool networks and our irrigation distribution network via both acquisitions and new sales center openings we plan to make strategic acquisitions to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

based on industry data we believe our industry grew at a 2 to 6 annual rate for the period between 2000 and 2005 contracted each year between 2006 and 2009 and was flat to slightly up in 2010 including the impact of moderating contraction within the irrigation industry in 2011 we estimate that the swimming pool industry grew 3 to 4 while the irrigation and landscape market was relatively flat historically our sales growth rates have exceeded the industry’s growth rates as we have increased our market share we believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have also enabled us to gain market share during the past six years including the period between 2006 and 2009 when our industry contracted and that these market share gains accelerated somewhat in 2011 going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 3 annually in our industry over the past 10 years we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in 2010 our industry experienced some price deflation after above average inflationary increases in product costs in 2008 and 2009 in 2011 our industry experienced more normalized price inflation of approximately 2 overall despite price deflation for certain chemical products we anticipate price inflation will vary some by product line but average 1 to 2 overall in 2012 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 80000 customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve five types of customers 

 

 

 

 

 

the majority of these customers are small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources the recent economic environment has had the greatest impact on swimming pool remodelers and builders and landscape construction companies we have seen a modest contraction in our customer base in these segments over the last several years 

we conduct our operations through 298 sales centers in north america and europe our primary markets which have the highest concentration of swimming pools are california texas florida and arizona representing approximately 50 of our net sales in 2011 we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

  

  

  

  

we offer our customers more than 160000 national brand and pool corporation branded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we track and monitor the majority of our sales by various product lines and product categories to provide support for sales and marketing efforts and for consideration in incentive plan programs we currently have over 300 product lines and over 40 product categories based on our 2011 product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 16 in 2011 and 17 in both 2010 and 2009 chemical sales grew 4 in 2011 with 6 volume growth driven by market share gains partially offset by price deflation of approximately 2 overall no other product category accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we categorize our maintenance repair and replacement products into the following two groupings 

 

 

maintenance and minor repair products are primarily nondiscretionary in nature meaning that these items must be purchased by end users to maintain existing swimming pools and landscaped areas between 2009 and 2011 the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits while approximately 30 of sales and gross profits were derived from the replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of pools and landscaping this reflected a shift toward more sales of maintenance and minor repair products due to the significant declines in new pool construction between 2005 and early 2010 prior to this industry downturn just over 50 of our total sales and gross profits were related to maintenance and minor repair products 

since our acquisition of national pool tile npt in 2008 we have expanded the number of sales center locations that offer npt’s tile and composite pool finish products from the original 14 locations to over 50 locations these locations feature showrooms where swimming pool dealers and homeowners can view and select pool components including tile decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades another key product initiative has been the expansion of our replacement parts offerings these product initiatives along with the continued expansion of our pool corporation branded products have contributed to improved gross margins 

products related to pool construction and remodeling have been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth sales of these products declined between 2007 and 2009 since the majority of these products are discretionary by nature but we realized some sales growth in 2010 followed by double digit sales growth in 2011 due to our ongoing expansion of these product offerings and the gradual improvement in construction and economic trends we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in certain markets we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those that we believe exhibit longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

  

  

  

 

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products domestically through our scp and superior networks and internationally through our scp network while we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the us swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

we also operate six centralized shipping locations csls that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or directly to customers our csls include regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and related construction products our regional csl in florida and another csl in california redistribute our npt tile and composite pool finish products to sales centers that stock these products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for manufacturers to offer seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms typically allow us to place orders in the fall prior to any seasonal price increases take delivery of product during the offseason months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer 

our preferred vendor program encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our purchasing activities these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have resulted in improved margins at the sales center level 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 17 11 and 9 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2011 

  

  

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of irrigation and landscape products we also face competition to a lesser extent from massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers both storebased and internet who buy directly from manufacturers 

some geographic markets we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california texas florida and arizona are more competitive than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3300 people at december 31 2011 given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200 to 500 employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property 

we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our private label products that are important to our current and future business operations we also own rights to several internet domain names

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

  

  

 

 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products has been and may continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool irrigation and related outdoor lifestyle products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for approximately 90 of our net sales and gross profits the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause deferrals of discretionary replacement and refurbish activity in addition even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pool and irrigation systems the recent unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market have resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which has limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pools and irrigation systems if these trends continue or worsen many consumers will likely not be able to obtain financing for pool and irrigation projects which could negatively impact our sales of construction related products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions which could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations and negatively impact our sales while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the shortterm or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 17 11 and 9 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2011 a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to other distributors retailers or enduse consumers could also adversely affect our business we dedicate considerable resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe significantly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

  

  

  

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers and large pool or landscape supply retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california texas florida and arizona representing approximately 50 of our net sales in 2011 also tend to be more competitive than others 

more aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through acquisitions market share gains and new sales center openings that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since the beginning of 2007 we completed 11 acquisitions consisting of 29 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2011 approximately 67 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of both swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and landscape installations and maintenance our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

 

  

  

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

we rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell and distribute as we increase the number of pool corporation branded products we distribute our exposure to potential liability claims may increase the risk of claims may also be greater with respect to products manufactured by thirdparty suppliers outside the united states particularly in china uncertainties with respect to foreign legal systems may adversely affect us in resolving claims arising from our foreign sourced products even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and our company 

for foreign sourced products we may be subject to certain trade restrictions that prevent us from obtaining products and there is also a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

  

  

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporate offices which consist of approximately 50000 square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50 ownership interest we own three sales center facilities in florida and one in texas we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three to seven year terms 

as of december 31 2011 we had 14 leases with remaining terms longer than seven years that expire between 2019 and 2027 most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000 square feet to 60000 square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls range in size from approximately 34000 square feet to 78000 square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including product liability personal injury commercial contract and employment matters litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 

as previously disclosed in november 2011 we entered into a proposed nonmonetary settlement agreement resolving the federal trade commission’s ftc nonpublic investigation into whether we had engaged in conduct in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act we did not admit any liability in connection with the settlement and believe the allegations were without merit the order approving the settlement became final on january 10 2012 

beginning in november 2011 a number of purported antitrust class action suits have been filed against us in various united states district courts these cases are currently the subject of motions to transfer and consolidate before the judicial panel for multidistrict litigation mdl docket no 2328 the plaintiffs who are current or former customers generally allege monopolization and attempted monopolization in violation of section 2 of the sherman antitrust act the complaints seek unspecified compensatory and enhanced damages interest costs and fees and other equitable relief we believe the complaints are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves 

while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable based on currently available facts we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters or other claims and litigation not discussed above will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and related events unfold

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2011 financial overview 

financial results 

we believe our 2011 results are a testament to outstanding execution at all levels of our organization and reflect a very strong performance in a year characterized by a stabilized but still challenging economic environment 

net sales increased 11 compared to 2010 including a 10 increase in base business sales this improvement was due primarily to market share gains but also reflected demand growth the impact of inflationary product cost increases and approximately 1 growth from favorable currency fluctuations demand growth was evidenced by higher replacement activity attributable to the aging installed base of swimming pools and a modest improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures compared to the restrained levels experienced in 2010 

for a discussion of our base business calculation see the results of operations section below 

gross profit increased 13 compared to 2010 while gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin increased 40 basis points to 296 this increase reflects continued improvements in sales pricing and purchasing discipline and a 10 basis point contribution from higher freight out income which compensated for higher delivery costs 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses for 2011 increased 10 with base business operating expenses up 8 year over year this included increases of 4 from higher employee incentive expenses 1 from higher delivery costs and 1 combined due to bad debt expense and the impact from currency fluctuations 

operating income for the year improved 24 while operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin increased 70 basis points to 70 net interest expense increased 13 million due to the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses with losses of 06 million recognized in 2011 compared to gains of 15 million recognized in 2010 interest expense related to borrowings declined approximately 07 million in 2011 due to a lower weighted average effective interest rate on 6 higher average debt compared to 2010 

net income increased 25 compared to 2010 while earnings per share was up 28 to 147 per diluted share 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations of 751 million in 2011 was 31 million more than net income and combined with our 486 million increase in debt funded the following 

 

 

 

 

total net receivables increased 9 compared to december 31 2010 due primarily to an increase in current trade receivables as a result of december base business sales growth higher vendor receivables and the impact from the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was 59 million at december 31 2011 a 12 million decrease compared to december 31 2010 that reflects both writeoffs of certain fully reserved customer accounts and significant improvements in our receivable aging trends days sales outstanding dso improved between periods to 299 days at december 31 2011 compared to 316 days at december 31 2010 

inventory levels were up 11 to 3869 million at december 31 2011 compared to levels at december 31 2010 excluding inventory of approximately 55 million from recent acquisitions inventories increased 10 year over year this increase was consistent with the increase in base business sales and virtually all of the inventory growth was in our inventory classes with the highest sales volumes our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis slowed to 32 times at december 31 2011 from 33 times at december 31 2010 

total debt outstanding was 2473 million at december 31 2011 an increase of 486 million compared to december 31 2010 

 

 

  

  

  

  

current trends and outlook 

the adverse housing and economic trends over the past several years had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45000 new units in 2009 to approximately 57000 new units in 2011 construction levels are still down approximately 70 compared to peak levels although general external market factors including consumer confidence employment consumer financing and economic growth remain at depressed levels these factors have shown some improvement and we believe our 2 base business sales growth in 2010 and our 10 base business sales growth in 2011 indicates that most pool markets are growing again and consumers have started to catch up on purchases deferred during the downturn 

trends have also improved on the irrigation side of our business with slowly moderating sales declines in 2010 followed by 8 base business sales growth in 2011 driven primarily by market share gains since irrigation is more heavily weighted toward new construction activities and there has not been any meaningful recovery in the housing market growth rates for this side of our business will probably continue to lag the swimming pool side of the business 

looking ahead we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and retrofit activity we also expect that market conditions will continue to improve enabling the recovery of replacement remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 8 to 10 years we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4 to 8 over this time period before reverting back to 3 to 5 annual growth over the longer term we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

in 2012 we expect that the macroeconomic environment will be similar to 2011 as such we anticipate that modest industry growth plus additional market share gains driven by our superior customer service and expanding product base will result in 5 to 8 base business sales growth this includes our expectation for average inflationary product cost increases of 1 to 2 we expect that our gross margin will improve modestly for the year in 2012 however we believe that differences in product and geographic sales mix could result in quarterly gross margin comparisons versus 2011 that vary by 30 or more basis points 

the most significant factor impacting our higher expense growth in 2011 was employee incentives this increase reflected both the catchup of incentives to more normalized levels following the business downturn in 20072009 and even more significantly a reward to employees for exceptional performance in 2011 considering the level of 2011 employee incentives and given our outlook for 2012 we expect employee incentive costs will be down yearoveryear overall we anticipate a modest increase in expenses in 2012 with higher growth in the first and fourth quarters and less in the second and third quarters due to the timing of our incentive compensation accruals the majority of the projected decline in employee incentive costs should be in the second and third quarters which is when we accrue the majority of our incentive compensation based on our greater profitability in these months with more normalized expense growth we expect base business results will generate operating profit growth as a percentage of base business sales growth contribution margin of 20 or higher in 2012 

based on these expectations we project that 2012 earnings per share will be approximately 169 to 179 per diluted share we expect cash provided by operations will exceed net income for fiscal 2012 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from 01 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than 20000 and more than 60 days past due additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 03 of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales were 02 in 2011 03 in 2010 and 04 in 2009 writeoffs in 2009 and 2010 were higher than our longterm historical average of approximately 02 of net sales due to the negative impacts on some of our customer’s businesses from the challenging external environment between 2007 and 2010 based on gradually improving external market trends and significant reductions in our past due receivables aging categories during 2010 and 2011 we expect that writeoffs will remain at approximately 02 of net sales in 2012 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2011 pretax income would change by approximately 12 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 001 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2011 

  

  

  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity sales centers classify products into 13 classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months or 36 months for tile products all inventory is included in these classes except for nonstock special order items and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 

 

there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2011 pretax income would change by approximately 14 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 002 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2011 

vendor incentives 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor incentives as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

  

  

 

 

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our gross margins for products purchased and sold in future periods

we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2011 we have not provided for united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if these earnings are repatriated to the united states in the future or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation 

  

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions 

we have operations in 38 states 1 united states territory and 9 foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

incentive compensation accrual 

we have an incentive compensation structure designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year 

  

  

  

  

management sets the objectives for our bonus plans at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record an incentive compensation accrual at the end of each month using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved towards the stated bonus plan objectives during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

our estimated quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

 

 

impairment of goodwill 

our largest intangible asset is goodwill at december 31 2011 our goodwill balance was 1771 million representing approximately 22 of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units has fallen below their carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

since we define our operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center as of october 1 2011 we had 209 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the highest goodwill balance was 71 million for our uk reporting unit for the other reporting units the highest goodwill balance was 57 million and the average goodwill balance was 08 million 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing a present value model that incorporates our assumptions for projected future cash flows discount rates and multiples in order to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value estimates we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate 

in october 2011 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and identified three horizon locations in texas that had estimated fair values below their carrying values the combined carrying value of goodwill for these three reporting units was 46 million since the estimated fair values for each reporting unit’s goodwill was below the respective carrying values we recognized the total difference of 16 million as an impairment loss we recorded this impairment in selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income we determined that the goodwill attributed to each of our other reporting units was not impaired 

  

based on the combination of their higher goodwill balances and 2011 operating results at approximately breakeven levels we believe that our reporting units most at risk for goodwill impairment include the three horizon locations in texas that had a recorded goodwill impairment in 2011 as well as two additional horizon locations in texas one horizon location in nevada one superior location in new jersey and our reporting units in the uk and spain as of december 31 2011 these reporting units had an aggregate goodwill balance of 192 million 

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods especially related to the reporting units discussed above additional impairment charges would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet we performed a sensitivity test for the two key assumptions in our 2011 annual goodwill impairment test and determined that an increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital of 50 basis points or a decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate of 50 basis points could have resulted in the estimated fair value of two additional at risk reporting units falling below their carrying values the total incremental calculated goodwill impairment based on this sensitivity test was approximately 08 million 

  

  

  

  

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

we are not aware of any recent accounting pronouncements that will materially impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2011 2010 and 2009 we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 

 

  

  

we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 

 

we exclude the following sales centers from base business results for a period of 15 months parenthetical numbers for each category indicate the number of sales centers excluded as of december 31 2011 

 

 

 

 

 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2011 

 

for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

  

  

net sales 

 

net sales for 2011 increased 11 compared to 2010 including a 10 increase in base business sales and a 1 increase related to our recent acquisitions and new sales centers our base business sales growth included a 10 increase on the swimming pool side of the business and an 8 increase on the irrigation side of the business the principal driver of base business sales growth was market share gains which we attributed to continued improvements in customer service levels benefits from our focus on the building materials product segment and retail customer segment of our industry and further expansion of our product offerings other factors contributing to the sales growth included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

 

 

 

one example of our success in achieving market share gains was the 18 sales growth for our building material products which include tile and specialty pool finish products the impact of double digit sales growth rates for products related to replacement and remodel activity was partially offset by lower growth rates for maintenance and repair products chemical sales grew 4 compared to 2010 with volumes up close to 6 and an unfavorable impact of 2 from price deflation on certain chemical products 

we realized more moderate sales growth rates in the last nine months of 2011 compared to the 15 base business sales growth realized in the first quarter of 2011 which had easier sales comparisons to the same period in 2010 and benefited from more favorable weather conditions across most of the sunbelt markets compared to the first quarter of 2010 see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations beginning on page 32 

gross profit 

 

gross margin increased 40 basis points between periods reflecting continued improvements in sales pricing and purchasing discipline this included a continued migration of sales to higher margin preferred vendor and pool corporation branded products and some benefit attributed to the impact of midyear vendor price increases implemented by some vendors we realized a favorable impact of 10 basis points related to higher freight out income which compensated for higher delivery costs included in operating expenses in 2011 we also experienced a more normalized competitive pricing environment in some markets compared to the past few years when our industry contracted 

year over year gross margin comparisons varied by quarter with improvements of 90 basis points in the seasonally slower first quarter 50 basis points in the second quarter and 60 basis points in the third quarter compared to a decline of 60 basis points in the fourth quarter the majority of the improvement in the first quarter was due to an easier comparison to the first quarter of 2010 when our gross margin was down 110 basis points from the first quarter of 2009 fourth quarter margins were down due primarily to the favorable impact on fourth quarter 2010 gross margin from certain nonrecurring vendor incentives 

  

  

operating expenses 

 

total operating expenses increased 10 compared to 2010 including an 8 increase in base business operating expenses due primarily to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only significant base business expense reduction compared to 2010 was a 21 million decline in facility lease costs which reflected the continued but moderating impact from lower negotiated lease rates and facility consolidations in 2010 and 2011 

interest expense net 

interest expense net increased 13 million due primarily to the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses with losses of 06 million recognized in 2011 compared to gains of 15 million recognized in 2010 interest expense related to borrowings declined approximately 07 million in 2011 despite a 03 million realized loss related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter the decline in interest expense on borrowings was due to a lower weighted average effective interest rate on 6 higher average debt compared to 2010 the weighted average effective interest rate decreased to 26 in 2011 from 30 in 2010 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 3870 at december 31 2011 and 3920 at december 31 2010 the decline in rates between years was due primarily to tax credits and other benefits realized in 2011 that we do not expect to realize in 2012 there were no significant changes in our estimates related to our income tax provision 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 25 to 720 million in 2011 while earnings per share increased 28 to 147 per diluted share this increase included accretive impacts of approximately 005 per diluted share from the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchase activities and approximately 002 per diluted share from favorable currency fluctuations in 2011 

  

  

 

 

fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 

 

we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 

 

 

we exclude the following sales centers from base business results for a period of 15 months parenthetical numbers for each category indicate the number of sales centers excluded as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2010 

 

 

for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 

 

net sales for 2010 increased 5 compared to 2009 including sales related to our recent acquisitions and a 2 increase in base business sales base business sales on the swimming pool side of the business increased 3 with growth of 5 in the last nine months of 2010 more than offsetting the 3 decline in base business sales during our seasonally slower first quarter our year over year comparative sales results improved as the first half of the 2010 season progressed based on the gradual improvement in external market trends more favorable weather conditions after midmarch and the easing of difficult sales comparisons due to the favorable impact primarily in the first half of 2009 related to the virginia graeme baker pool and spa safety act the vgb act favorable base business sales comparisons to 2009 reflect the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

 

 

these sales increases were partially offset by the following 

 

 

 

 

  

  

gross profit 

 

gross margin was flat between years as continued improvements in pricing and purchasing discipline offset both the lingering negative impact from intense price competition within our industry and lower gross margins realized by our recent acquisitions 

in the seasonally slow first quarter of 2010 gross margin declined 110 basis points due primarily to the impact of margin benefits realized in the first quarter of 2009 related to our preprice increase inventory buys in the second half of 2008 a comparative increase of 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2008 as this difficult gross margin comparison to 2009 eased during the second quarter of 2010 we realized only a 20 basis point decline in gross margin compared to the second quarter of 2009 

gross margin increased 20 basis points for the last nine months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 including increases of 10 basis points in the third quarter and 150 basis points in the fourth quarter in addition to the benefits from improved pricing and purchasing discipline this margin growth also reflected the following 

 

 

 

the 150 basis point improvement in the seasonally slow fourth quarter also included a favorable impact of approximately 60 basis points due to our year end adjustment of estimated to actual vendor incentives earned for the year 

operating expenses 

 

total operating expenses increased 2 compared to 2009 due primarily to expenses related to our recent acquisitions base business operating expenses were essentially flat with offsetting variances in different expense categories between years 

increases in base business operating expenses compared to 2009 included the following 

 

 

 

  

  

offsetting decreases in base business expenses compared to 2009 included the following 

 

 

 

 

total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 60 basis points between periods 

interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased 32 between periods due primarily to a 23 lower average outstanding debt balance compared to 2009 the weighted average effective interest rate also decreased to 30 in 2010 from 34 in 2009 interest expense net included foreign currency transaction gains of 15 million in 2010 and 18 million in 2009 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 3920 at december 31 2010 and 3930 at december 31 2009 there were no significant changes in our estimates related to our income tax provision 

net income and earnings per share 

net income was 576 million in 2010 and earnings per share increased to 115 per diluted share this compares to earnings of 039 per diluted share in 2009 which included a 054 per diluted share impact related to our pro rata share of lac’s impairment charge included in the reported equity loss earnings per share for 2010 included an accretive impact of approximately 002 per diluted share from our recent acquisitions 

  

  

  

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2011 approximately 67 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2011 and 2010 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 

 

  

 

 

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

  

  

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 

 

overall we believe that weather had a small favorable impact on sales in 2011 sales benefited from favorable weather conditions in the southeast and southwest including record high temperatures in texas although this impact was partially offset by unfavorable conditions throughout the year on the west coast due to cooler than average temperatures in the first quarter of 2011 our sales benefited from much more favorable weather conditions across the sunbelt markets compared to the same period in 2010 sales in our north texas and oklahoma markets were also positively impacted by repair and replacement activity for freeze damaged pool equipment while our sales in the second quarter of 2011 benefited from above average temperatures across the southeast a slow start to the pool season in the midwest due to record precipitation levels and closer to average temperatures across the northeast resulted in some unfavorable comparisons to the same period in 2010 in the third quarter of 2011 we estimate that the weather impact on sales was neutral overall compared to both the same period in 2010 and longterm averages weather conditions were more favorable in the fourth quarter of 2011 with warmer temperatures across much of the eastern half of the country compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 

  

our first quarter 2010 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions across the sunbelt markets between january and midmarch including record cold weather in florida and much colder than average temperatures across the rest of the southeast however warmer weather in these regions during the latter half of march and near record warm temperatures in march across our markets in the northeast and canada helped drive a late rebound in our daily sales rates and flat base business sales overall for march compared to the same period in 2009 sales in our second and third quarters of 2010 benefitted from much more favorable weather conditions across the southeast midwest and northeast compared to the same periods in 2009 including record or near record high temperatures across the eastern half of the united states and our markets in canada during the second quarter of 2010 however this benefit was largely offset by the adverse impact from unseasonably cool weather along the west coast throughout the 2010 pool season most notably in california our largest market 

while weather conditions in the first quarter of 2009 were generally favorable we did not realize any positive impact on sales given the overriding adverse economic environment unfavorable weather delayed the start of the pool season in 2009 in most markets due to much colder than average temperatures in april throughout the second quarter of 2009 weather conditions were unfavorable overall and adversely impacted sales due to cold and wet conditions in the midwest and northeast the southwest also experienced unseasonably cool and wet weather during june while weather conditions were favorable in the western us and florida in the third quarter of 2009 due to warmer than average temperatures our sales were also negatively impacted due to much colder than normal temperatures that shortened the pool season in most central and northern markets and higher than normal rainfall in the south central united states near record precipitation across most of the central and southeast regions and much colder than average temperatures in the western half of the united states negatively impacted our fourth quarter 2009 sales 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent debt structure and returning money to our shareholders our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

while historically our capital expenditures have averaged 05 to 075 of net sales they were below and at the bottom of this range between 2008 and 2010 due to lower capacity expansion in 2011 capital expenditures increased to 11 of net sales since we began purchasing rather than leasing new vehicles and forklifts going forward we project capital expenditures will be relatively consistent with 2011 and average approximately 10 of net sales 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 

 

cash provided by operations in 2011 exceeded net income by 31 million compared to last year cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to our drawdown of inventories in 2010 and the impact of higher comparative inventory levels in 2011 the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2010 reflects higher capital expenditures which included a few large information technology upgrade projects and an impact of approximately 61 million related to purchasing rather than leasing new vehicles and forklifts in 2011 cash used in financing activities in 2011 reflects 486 million of net debt borrowings which helped fund 710 million of share repurchases 

on october 19 2011 we entered into a new 4300 million unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility described further below since the credit facility replaced and refinanced the outstanding balances under our 2400 million unsecured revolving credit facility the previous revolver proceeds from and payments on revolving lines of credit in 2011 reflect the 1615 million payoff of the previous revolver 

  

  

  

  

cash provided by operations in 2010 declined 193 million compared to 2009 due primarily to a decline in cash generated from working capital improvements in 2009 cash provided by operations benefited from a 17 year over year reduction in accounts receivable balances and a 12 year over year reduction in inventory levels as of december 31 2009 this benefit to cash provided by operations in 2009 more than offset the unfavorable impact of paying our 300 million deferred third and fourth quarter 2008 estimated federal income taxes in january 2009 in 2010 the decrease in cash used in investing activities was due to comparatively lower cash paid for acquisitions the change between periods in cash flows used in financing activities reflects lower net debt payments in 2010 which correlates with the comparative decline in cash provided by operating activities partially offset by the impact of our share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2010 

future sources and uses of cash 

the credit facility provides for 4300 million in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 5050 million the credit facility matures on october 19 2016 

at december 31 2011 there was 1473 million outstanding and 2800 million available for borrowing under the credit facility we currently have five interest rate swap agreements in place that reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the credit facility these swap agreements convert the credit facility’s variable interest rate to fixed rates of 1185 on notional amounts totaling 500 million 1100 on a notional amount of 500 million 1050 on a notional amount of 250 million and 0990 on a notional amount of 250 million interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swaps is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility the swap agreement with a 1050 fixed rate was effective january 17 2012 and the swap agreement with a 0990 fixed rate was effective january 19 2012 the other three swap agreements were in place as of december 31 2011 all five swap agreements will terminate on october 19 2016 the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31 2011 was approximately 22 excluding commitment fees 

we used the credit facility to pay our 1000 million floating rate senior notes the notes at maturity on february 12 2012 we also intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives 

financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2011 the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 

the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in the credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends further dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice under the credit facility we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the repurchase of shares and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250 to 100 other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens incur indebtedness make investments merge or consolidate and sell or transfer assets failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in penalty payments higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt 

  

  

  

  

as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2012   for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 21 2012 682 million of the current board authorized amount under our share repurchase program remained available we expect to repurchase additional shares on the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit facility 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2011 our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 

 

for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments related to our longterm debt obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2011 outstanding balances of each of our debt instruments using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31 2011 for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swaps to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity date of the credit facility 

 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2011 there was no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swaps for the previous revolver the credit facility and the notes the portions of our outstanding balances under the previous revolver the credit facility and the notes that were not covered by our interest rate swaps were subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2011 related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amounts under the previous revolver or the credit facility in each case excluding the accordion feature in this analysis we assumed that the variable interest rates for these instruments and the notes increased 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 28 million and earnings per share would have decreased by approximately 004 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2011 the maximum amount available under the previous revolver was 2400 million excluding the 750 million accordion feature 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom belgium france germany italy portugal spain and mexico based on the functional currencies for these international subsidiaries as shown in the table below changes in exchange rates for these currencies may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 103 of total net sales in 2011 our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2012 and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results 

 

  

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

the term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the act the rules refer to the controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the act is 1 recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and 2 accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of december 31 2011 management including the ceo and cfo performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation management including the ceo and cfo concluded that as of december 31 2011 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles based on the most recent evaluation we have concluded that no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

general 

based on industry data pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as we us or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the united states the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2010 we operated 291 sales centers in north america and europe through our three distribution networks 

 

 

 

superior and horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of scp which is wholly owned by pool corporation 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 80 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 12 currently have a pool we believe favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have and will continue to positively impact the longterm prospects of our industry these favorable trends include the following 

 

 

 

the irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry and we believe that it benefits from the same favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends and will realize longterm growth rates similar to the pool industry 

approximately 70 of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance related goods and certain discretionary products 

 

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth this has also helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market have adversely impacted pool construction and major repair and refurbishment activities 

 

  

  

the table below reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground and aboveground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2010 pk data inc reports 

 

the replacement and refurbishment market includes major swimming pool repairs and currently accounts for approximately 20 of consumer spending in the pool industry this activity is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market 

new swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of the remaining 10 of consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations 

the landscape and irrigation distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market landscape and irrigation maintenance activities account for 40 of total spending in the irrigation industry with the remaining 60 of spending related to irrigation construction and other discretionary related products as such our irrigation business is more heavily weighted towards the sale of discretionary related products compared to our pool business and is therefore more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending 

general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp the availability of consumer credit and certain trends in the housing market affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts positive gdp trends may have a favorable impact on industry starts while negative trends may be unfavorable for industry starts we believe that similar to trends for other home improvement expenditures there is a direct correlation between industry starts and the rate of housing turnover and home appreciation over time with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems 

the adverse housing and economic trends over the past several years had a significant impact on our industry and our performance these trends drove an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributed to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities the impact of these trends was more severe in some of the largest pool markets including california florida and arizona since irrigation is more heavily weighted towards new construction activities the impact was greater on our horizon business due to the significant declines in new home and commercial construction activities in order to mitigate the greater rate of earnings decline for our irrigation business we have consolidated several facilities and have significantly reduced operating costs related to our horizon network over the past two years 

while general external market factors including consumer confidence employment consumer financing and economic growth remain at depressed levels these factors have shown recent signs of improvement and we believe our 2 base business sales growth in 2010 indicates that the declines in pool construction and pool refurbishment activities have subsided in most markets trends that impact our landscape and irrigation markets tend to lag the trends in the corresponding pool markets by up to a year consistent with this expectation trends on the irrigation side of our business began to improve during 2010 with slowly moderating sales declines highlighted by a number of markets realizing sales growth in the second half of the year and higher sales overall in december 2010 compared to december 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

we still believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and retrofit activity and our expectation for gradually normalized new pool and irrigation construction levels while current economic trends indicate that consumer spending may rebound slowly and that construction activities in many markets will likely remain near current depressed levels through 2011 we believe that new pool and irrigation construction activities will gradually return to more normalized levels we expect that sales levels should once again benefit from longterm industry growth dynamics and that over the longterm the industry will return to an annual growth rate of approximately 2 to 6 when the overall economy rebounds and the real estate and credit markets recover 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can delay or accelerate the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer attitudes toward pool and landscape products for environmental or safety reasons 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are as follows 

 

 

 

we promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives including social media we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with everything from site selection to store layout and design to business management system implementation 

growth initiatives related to our customer programs include our retail brand licensing program called the backyard place® and our pool pro 1 rewards program designed for pool service professionals we launched the backyard place® program in 2006 and currently have over 100 agreements with retail store customers under this program customers make commitments to meet minimum purchase levels stock a minimum of nine specific product categories and operate within the backyard place® guidelines including weekend hour requirements  our pool pro 1 program aligns with our replacement parts growth initiative and provides customers with monthly coupons and other special discounts on parts product purchases over 2400 pool service professionals are members of this program 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management other key internal growth initiatives include the continued expansion of both our product offerings as described in the “customers and products” section below and our distribution networks 

  

  

  

  

we have grown our distribution networks through acquisitions new sales center openings and expansions of existing sales centers since the beginning of 2006 we completed 9 acquisitions consisting of 37 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition and opened 11 new sales centers net of all other sales center closings and consolidations these acquired locations included nine net sales centers added ahead of the 2010 season through our general pool  spa supply and metrinox acquisitions given the challenging external environment we opened only three new sales centers in 2010 and expect to open only three new sales centers in 2011 

we plan to continue to selectively expand our domestic swimming pool distribution networks and to take advantage of opportunities to further expand our domestic irrigation and international swimming pool distribution networks via both acquisitions and new sales center openings we plan to make strategic acquisitions to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

based on industry data we believe our industry grew at a 2 to 6 annual rate for the period between 2000 and 2005 contracted each year between 2006 and 2009 and was flat to slightly up in 2010 including the impact of moderating contraction within the irrigation industry historically our sales growth rates have exceeded the industry’s growth rates as we have increased our market share we believe that our high service levels and expanded product offerings have also enabled us to gain market share during the past five years even as our industry contracted going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that price inflation has averaged 1 to 3 annually in our industry over the past 10 years we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in 2010 our industry experienced some price deflation after experiencing above average inflationary increases in product costs in 2008 and 2009 in 2011 we anticipate more normalized price inflation of 1 to 2 overall although we expect price deflation for certain chemical products 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 80000 customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve five types of customers 

 

 

 

 

 

the majority of these customers are small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources the recent economic environment has had the greatest impact on swimming pool remodelers and builders and landscape construction companies we have seen a modest contraction in our customer base in these segments over the last several years 

we conduct our operations through 291 sales centers in north america and europe our primary markets which have the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 50 of our net sales in 2010 we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

  

  

  

  

we offer our customers more than 160000 national brand and pool corporation branded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we track and monitor the majority of our sales by various product lines and product categories primarily for consideration in incentive plan programs and to provide support for sales and marketing efforts we currently have over 300 product lines and over 40 product categories based on our 2010 product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 14 in 2008 and 17 in both 2009 and 2010 we attribute the growth between 2008 and 2009 to increases in our market share a shift in product mix resulting from the decline in construction related products and chemical price increases chemical sales growth in 2010 was consistent with our overall base business sales growth rate despite price deflation for certain chemical products no other product category accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we categorize our maintenance repair and replacement products into the following two groupings 

 

 

maintenance and minor repair products are primarily nondiscretionary in nature meaning that these items must be purchased by end users to maintain existing swimming pools and landscaped areas in 2009 and 2010 the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits while approximately 30 of sales and gross profits were derived from the replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of pools and landscaping this reflects a shift toward more sales of maintenance and minor repair products due to the significant declines in new pool construction since 2005 prior to this industry downturn just over 50 of our total sales and gross profits were related to maintenance and minor repair products 

since our acquisition of national pool tile npt in 2008 we have expanded the number of sales center locations that offer npt’s tile and composite pool finish products from the original 14 locations to over 50 locations another key product initiative has been the expansion of our replacement parts offerings these product initiatives along with the continued expansion of our pool corporation branded products have contributed to improved gross margins 

other pool construction and recreational product sales have been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth while sales of these products declined between 2007 and 2009 since the majority of these products are related to new construction activities or are discretionary by nature sales increased in 2010 due to our ongoing expansion of these product offerings and the gradual improvement in construction and economic trends we continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce two to three of these new categories each year in certain markets we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those that we believe exhibit longterm growth potential we expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a companywide basis 

  

  

operating strategy 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products through our scp and superior networks and we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

we also operate seven centralized shipping locations csls that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or directly to customers our csls include regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool irrigation and related construction products our regional csl in florida and another csl in california redistribute our npt tile and composite pool finish products to sales centers that stock these products 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms are typically available to us for preseason or early season purchases 

our preferred vendor program encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors we also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our purchasing activities these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have resulted in improved margins at the sales center level 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 17 12 and 9 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2010 

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of landscape and irrigation products in the united states and we compete against one national wholesale distributor of these products we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal distribution networks 

  

  

some geographic markets we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona are more competitive than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brandname products if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights we might be materially and adversely affected we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 

we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3200 people at december 31 2010 given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200 to 500 employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property 

we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our private label products that are important to our current and future business operations we also own rights to several internet domain names

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

  

  

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool and related outdoor lifestyle products has been and may continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for approximately 90 of our net sales and gross profits the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and early 2010 a weak economy may also cause deferrals of discretionary replacement and refurbish activity in addition even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new pool and irrigation systems the recent unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market have resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which has limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pool and irrigation systems if these trends continue or worsen many consumers will likely not be able to obtain financing for pool and irrigation projects which could negatively impact our sales of construction related products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions which could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations and negatively impact our sales while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the shortterm or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to our success we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply chains by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair water pool and spa inc hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 17 12 and 9 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2010 a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retailers or other end users of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to other distributors retailers or enduse consumers could also adversely affect our business we dedicate considerable resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe significantly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

  

  

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers and large pool or landscape supply retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 50 of our net sales in 2010 also tend to be more competitive than others 

more aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for our direct customers and enduse consumers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through acquisitions market share gains and new sales center openings that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since the beginning of 2006 we completed 9 acquisitions consisting of 37 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition and opened 11 new sales centers net of all other sales center closings and consolidations while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2010 approximately 68 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year these quarters represent the peak months of both swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and landscape installations and maintenance our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

  

  

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

we source certain products we sell including our pool corporation branded products from asia and other international sources there is a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner and we may also be subject to certain trade restrictions that prevent us from obtaining products fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporate offices which consist of approximately 50000 square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50 ownership interest we own three sales center facilities in florida and one in texas we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three to seven year terms as of december 31 2010 we had 11 leases with remaining terms longer than seven years that expire between 2018 and 2027 most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000 square feet to 60000 square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls range in size from approximately 26000 square feet to 78000 square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including product liability personal injury commercial contract and employment matters while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable we do not believe based on currently available facts that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the federal trade commission ftc notified us that it is conducting a nonpublic investigation to determine whether we have engaged in conduct in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act we are cooperating with the ftc in its investigation and have been informed by the ftc that the existence of an investigation does not suggest that it has made a determination that a violation by us has occurred or is occurring while we are not able to predict with certainty the timing outcome or consequence of this investigation we believe that we are in compliance with all federal and state laws governing competition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2010 financial overview 

financial results 

as we expected 2010 proved to be a transitional year we realized a return to sales and earnings growth continued improvements in working capital management and another season of strong cash flow generation successful execution of our strategies was the primary factor driving our increased sales and earnings with both our continued investment in growth initiatives and our ability to leverage the existing infrastructure to support sales growth providing significant contributions to our improved profitability 

net sales increased 5 compared to 2009 base business sales were up 2   due to market share gains including sales for expanded product offerings and some improvement in external market trends which resulted in higher discretionary purchases by consumers base business sales growth was 3 on the swimming pool side of the business with increases in many markets and most product categories while sales on the irrigation side of the business decreased compared to 2009 due to continued weakness in construction markets sales declines moderated as 2010 progressed for a discussion of our base business calculation see the results of operations section below 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin remained flat year over year at 292 as the benefits from our improved pricing and purchasing discipline offset downward margin pressures due to the competitive pricing environment 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses increased 2 in 2010 due primarily to the impact from recent acquisitions base business operating expenses were essentially flat compared to 2009 with a 91 million increase in incentive costs offset by decreases in bad debt expense facility lease costs and other expenses 

operating income improved 14 to 1012 million in 2010 while operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin increased 60 basis points to 63 interest expense net declined 30 million compared to 2009 due primarily to a 23 decrease in average debt outstanding 

we no longer have an equity interest in latham acquisition corporation lac and did not recognize any impact related to lac’s 2010 results in 2009 we recognized a total equity loss of 287 million for lac this included a 265 million equity loss related to our pro rata share of lac’s noncash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge and 22 million for our share of lac’s loss from ongoing operations 

earnings per share was 115 per diluted share on net income of 576 million for 2010 compared to earnings per share of 039 per diluted share on net income of 192 million in 2009 the 076 increase in diluted earnings per share includes the 054 per diluted share impact from our pro rata portion of lac’s impairment charge included in the 2009 reported equity loss 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations of 940 million in 2010 funded the following 

 

 

 

 

 

total net receivables increased 5 compared to december 31 2009 due to an increase in current trade receivables as a result of base business sales growth higher vendor rebate receivables and the impact from the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts this increase was partially offset by reductions in our past due receivable balances due primarily to significant improvements in customer collections as of december 31 2010 we realized a year over year decrease of 730 basis points in our total past due receivables balance as a percentage of total receivables our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was 71 million at december 31 2010 a decrease of 43 million compared to december 31 2009 reflecting both writeoffs of certain fully reserved customer accounts and our reduction of the allowance based on our improved receivables aging trends days sales outstanding dso decreased between periods to 316 days at december 31 2010 compared to 349 days at december 31 2009 

  

  

  

  

our inventory levels decreased 2 to 3474 million as of december 31 2010 from 3555 million as of december 31 2009 reflecting the success of our continued inventory rebalancing efforts we realized this reduction despite the year over year increase in base business sales approximately 59 million of inventory from acquisitions and higher inventories for expanded product offerings in tile pool finishes and replacement parts our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis improved to 33 times at december 31 2010 from 30 times at december 31 2009 

current trends and outlook 

the adverse housing and economic trends over the past several years had a significant impact on our industry driving an approximate 80 reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30 decline in replacement and refurbishment activities while general external market factors including consumer confidence employment consumer financing and economic growth remain at depressed levels these factors have shown recent signs of improvement and we believe our 2 base business sales growth in 2010 indicates that the declines in pool construction and pool refurbishment activities have subsided in most markets trends are also improving on the irrigation side of our business with slowly moderating sales declines in 2010 highlighted by a number of markets realizing sales growth in the second half of the year and higher sales overall in december 2010 compared to december 2009 

looking ahead we still believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the buildup of deferred replacement and retrofit activity and our expectation for gradually normalized new pool and irrigation construction levels while current economic trends indicate that consumer spending may rebound slowly and that construction activities will likely remain near current depressed levels through 2011 we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent longterm growth opportunities in our industry 

in 2011 we expect our results will trend similar to the last nine months of 2010 we expect to realize modest base business sales growth in the low to midsingle digit percentages and we anticipate average inflationary product cost increases of 1 to 2 in 2011 with some price deflation for certain chemical products given the continued competitive pricing environment we expect that our gross margin will be up modestly compared to 2010 base business expenses should be up slightly but down as a percentage of sales compared to 2010 excluding any acquisition activity we plan to open three new sales centers in 2011 based on these expectations we project that 2011 earnings per share will be in the range of 127 to 135 per diluted share we expect cash provided by operations will approximate or exceed net income for fiscal 2011 

the forwardlooking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from 01 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than 20000 additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote these writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 03 of net sales annually writeoffs as a percentage of net sales were 03 in 2010 04 in 2009 and 03 in 2008 these writeoff rates were higher than our longterm historical average of approximately 02 of net sales due to the negative impacts on some of our customer’s businesses from the challenging external environment during this period based on our tighter credit policies gradually improving external market trends and significant reductions in our past due receivables aging categories during 2010 we expect that writeoffs will decrease in 2011 and be closer to 02 of net sales 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2010 pretax income would change by approximately 14 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 002 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2010 

  

  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity sales centers classify products into 13 classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months all inventory is included in these classes except for nonstock special order items and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 

 

there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2010 pretax income would change by approximately 14 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 002 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2010 

vendor incentives 

many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor incentives as if they are a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

  

  

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for annual purchases and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our gross margins for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2010 we have not provided for united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the united states if these earnings are repatriated to the united states in the future or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

  

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions   

we have operations in 38 states and 8 foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

incentive compensation accrual 

we have an incentive compensation structure designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year 

management sets the objectives for our bonus plans at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record an incentive compensation accrual at the end of each month using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved towards the stated bonus plan objectives during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

  

  

  

  

our estimated quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

 

 

impairment of goodwill 

our largest intangible asset is goodwill at december 31 2010 our goodwill balance was 1785 million representing approximately 25 of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units has fallen below their carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units’ goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units’ goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income since we define our operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center 

in october 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2010 we had 210 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the highest goodwill balance is 71 million for our uk reporting unit for the other reporting units the highest goodwill balance is 57 million and the average goodwill balance is 08 million we estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing a fair value model which requires us to make several assumptions about projected future cash flows discount rates and multiples in order to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value estimates we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate based on our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the goodwill attributed to all of our reporting units is not impaired 

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change we could incur impairment charges in future periods which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet for example we performed a sensitivity test for the two key assumptions in our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that an increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital of 50 basis points or a decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate of 1 could have resulted in the estimated fair value of six reporting units falling below their carrying values the calculated goodwill impairment based on this sensitivity test was approximately 18 million combined for all six reporting units based on the combination of their higher goodwill balances and 2010 operating results at approximately break even levels we believe that our reporting units most at risk for goodwill impairment include the uk spain one new jersey location and four horizon locations in texas while one sales center in canada continues to generate solid operating results it is also considered at risk for goodwill impairment due to the combination of a higher than average goodwill balance and the fact that it has a small manufacturing operation that could require higher capital investments in the future 

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

we are not aware of any recent accounting pronouncements that will materially impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

  

  

  

  

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2010 2009 and 2008 we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 

 

we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 

 

 

  

  

we exclude the following sales centers from base business results for a period of 15 months parenthetical numbers for each category indicate the number of sales centers excluded as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2010 

 

 

for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 

 

net sales for 2010 increased 5 compared to 2009 including sales related to our recent acquisitions and a 2 increase in base business sales base business sales on the swimming pool side of the business increased 3 with growth of 5 in the last nine months of 2010 more than offsetting the 3 decline in base business sales during our seasonally slower first quarter our year over year comparative sales results improved as the first half of the 2010 season progressed based on the gradual improvement in external market trends more favorable weather conditions after midmarch and the easing of difficult sales comparisons due to the favorable impact primarily in the first half of 2009 related to the virginia graeme baker pool and spa safety act the vgb act favorable base business sales comparisons to 2009 reflect the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

these sales increases were partially offset by the following 

 

 

 

 

gross profit 

 

gross margin was flat between years as continued improvements in pricing and purchasing discipline offset both the lingering negative impact from intense price competition within our industry and lower gross margins realized by our recent acquisitions 

in the seasonally slow first quarter of 2010 gross margin declined 110 basis points due primarily to the impact of margin benefits realized in the first quarter of 2009 related to our preprice increase inventory buys in the second half of 2008 a comparative increase of 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2008 as this difficult gross margin comparison to 2009 eased during the second quarter of 2010 we realized only a 20 basis point decline in gross margin compared to the second quarter of 2009 

gross margin increased 20 basis points for the last nine months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 including increases of 10 basis points in the third quarter and 150 basis points in the fourth quarter in addition to the benefits from improved pricing and purchasing discipline this margin growth also reflected the following 

 

 

 

the 150 basis point improvement in the seasonally slow fourth quarter also included a favorable impact of approximately 60 basis points due to our year end adjustment of estimated to actual vendor incentives earned for the year 

operating expenses 

 

total operating expenses increased 2 compared to 2009 due primarily to expenses related to our recent acquisitions base business operating expenses were essentially flat with offsetting variances in different expense categories between years 

increases in base business operating expenses compared to 2009 included the following 

 

 

 

  

  

offsetting decreases in base business expenses compared to 2009 included the following 

 

 

 

 

total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 60 basis points between periods 

interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased 32 between periods due primarily to a 23 lower average outstanding debt balance compared to 2009 the weighted average effective interest rate also decreased to 30 in 2010 from 34 in 2009 interest expense net included foreign currency transaction gains of 15 million in 2010 and 18 million in 2009 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 3920 at december 31 2010 and 3930 at december 31 2009 there were no significant changes in our estimates related to our income tax provision 

net income and earnings per share 

net income was 576 million in 2010 and earnings per share increased to 115 per diluted share this compares to earnings of 039 per diluted share in 2009 which included a 054 per diluted share impact related to our pro rata share of lac’s impairment charge included in the reported equity loss earnings per share for 2010 included an accretive impact of approximately 002 per diluted share from our recent acquisitions 

 

  

  

fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 

 

for an explanation of how we calculate base business please refer to the discussion of base business on page 24 under the heading “fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009” 

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2009 to the year ended december 31 2008 we excluded acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below as of december 31 2009 we also excluded one existing sales center consolidated with an acquired sales center and five closed sales centers including one closed in 2009 since we divested our pool liner manufacturing operation in france in april 2008 we also excluded these operations from base business 

 

 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2009 

 

for information about our 2008 and 2009 acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

  

  

net sales 

 

in 2009 the new pool and irrigation construction markets continued to face unprecedented adverse conditions created by the combination of significant declines in the real estate and the mortgagebacked financing markets coupled with a severely depressed economic environment these external factors placed considerable pressure on our top line results as a result our sales were negatively impacted as construction activities remained depressed and consumers continued to defer discretionary replacement purchases 

base business sales decreased 15 compared to 2008 including a 12 decline on the swimming pool side of the business and a 37 decline on the irrigation side of the business which is more heavily weighted toward new construction and discretionary product sales overall weather conditions were unfavorable compared to the same period in 2008 see discussion of significant weather impacts under the heading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations beginning on page 30 unfavorable currency fluctuations also resulted in a decrease in sales of approximately 1 

the overall decrease in net sales was partially offset by the following 

 

 

 

 

 

our sales growth for maintenance and repair products was primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

gross profit 

 

in 2009 gross margin increased 30 basis points compared to 2008 as a shift in sales mix to products in the higher margin maintenance and repair market and specific margin improvement initiatives helped offset the adverse impact on gross margins due to the tough competitive pricing environment g ross margin increased 60 basis points in the first half of 2009 but was flat in the second half of 2009 for the year favorable impacts compared to 2008 included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

operating expenses 

 

the decrease in operating expenses reflects a 10 decline in base business operating expenses due primarily to the impact of our cost control initiatives including lower payroll related variable and discretionary expenses average monthly total headcount in 2009 decreased 10 compared to 2008 driving a 9 decline in total labor and related costs total delivery expenses declined 25 reflecting lower delivery volumes and decreases in both vehicle operating expenses including lower fuel costs and vehicle rental expenses most discretionary expenses declined compared to 2008 including a 21 million decrease in advertising costs bad debt expense also decreased 52 million as the rate of customer payment issues has fallen after peaking at the end of the 2008 season 

the decrease in base business operating expenses was partially offset by the impact of our acquired sales centers during the first quarter of 2009 we realized approximately 20 million in operating expenses related to our 2008 acquisitions and we incurred 15 million of operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to our acquisition of gps despite the decrease in headcount employee insurance costs increased 16 million compared to 2008 due primarily to several high dollar claims in the fourth quarter of 2009 total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased between periods due to the decrease in net sales 

interest expense net 

interest expense net declined 92 million compared to 2008 due primarily to a 41 decrease in interest expense and 18 million of foreign currency transaction gains interest expense declined due to a 17 lower average outstanding debt balance and a decrease in the weighted average effective interest rate to 34 in 2009 from 48 2008 

income taxes 

the decrease in income taxes is due to the decrease in income before income taxes and equity earnings losses our effective income tax rate was 3930 at december 31 2009 and 3926 at december 31 2008 

net income and earnings per share 

net income decreased to 192 million in 2009 compared to 570 million in 2008 earnings per share for 2009 decreased to 039 per diluted share compared to 117 in 2008 the 078 decrease in diluted earnings per share reflects the 054 per diluted share impact of lac’s impairment charge included in the reported equity loss for 2009 the dilutive impact of our fourth quarter 2009 acquisition was approximately 001 per diluted share for 2009 

  

  

  

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2010 approximately 68 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season our accounts payable balance was lower than normal seasonal levels as of march 31 2009 due to early payments we made through the first quarter of 2009 to take advantage of preprice increase inventory purchases and early payment discounts offered by certain vendors excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2010 and 2009 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of our industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 

 

      note due to rounding the sum of quarterly percentage amounts may not equal 100 

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

  

  

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 

 

our first quarter 2010 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions across the sunbelt markets between january and midmarch including record cold weather in florida and much colder than average temperatures across the rest of the southeast however warmer weather in these regions during the latter half of march and near record warm temperatures in march across our markets in the northeast and canada helped drive a late rebound in our daily sales rates and flat base business sales overall for march compared to the same period in 2009 sales in our second and third quarters of 2010 benefitted from much more favorable weather conditions across the southeast midwest and northeast compared to the same periods in 2009 however this benefit was largely offset by the adverse impact from unseasonably cool weather along the west coast throughout the 2010 pool season most notably in california our largest market 

while weather conditions in the first quarter of 2009 were generally favorable compared to the same period in 2008 we did not realize any positive impact on sales given the overriding adverse economic environment unfavorable weather delayed the start of the pool season in both 2008 and 2009 in a number of our markets with the 2009 season adversely impacted in most markets by much colder than normal temperatures in april throughout the second quarter of 2009 weather conditions were unfavorable overall and adversely impacted sales due to cold and wet conditions in the midwest and northeast the southwest also experienced unseasonably cool and wet weather during june our third quarter 2009 sales were also negatively impacted due to much colder than normal temperatures that shortened the pool season in most central and northern markets and higher than normal rainfall in the south central united states consistent with the third quarter of 2008 weather conditions were favorable in the western us and florida due to warmer than average temperatures however near record precipitation across most of the central and southeast regions and much colder than average temperatures in the western half of the united states negatively impacted our fourth quarter 2009 sales 

in 2008 our sales were negatively impacted by generally unfavorable weather conditions including cooler temperatures and higher precipitation nationally compared to averages the start of the 2008 pool season was delayed due to several late winter storms in the midwest and northeast and much cooler march temperatures across most of the country cooler than normal temperatures in august and september also shortened the pool season in 2008 for most north american markets excluding the west coast while a number of severe tropical systems adversely impacted our sales in texas florida and louisiana during the third quarter of 2008 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent debt structure and returning money to our shareholders our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

in november 2010 we reactivated our board authorized share repurchase program 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 

 

cash provided by operations was 940 million in 2010 a decrease of 193 million compared to 2009 due primarily to a decline in cash generated from working capital improvements in 2009 cash provided by operations benefited from a 17 year over year reduction in accounts receivable balances and a 12 year over year reduction in inventory levels as of december 31 2009 cash provided by operations in 2009 was unfavorably impacted by the timing of our payment for 2008 estimated federal income taxes see discussion below in 2010 the decrease in cash used in investing activities is due to comparatively lower cash paid for acquisitions the change between periods in cash flows used in financing activities reflects lower net debt payments in 2010 which correlates with the comparative decline in cash provided by operating activities partially offset by the impact of our share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2010 

  

  

  

  

cash provided by operations increased 200 million to 1133 million in 2009 compared to 2008 in january 2009 we paid 300 million for our deferred third and fourth quarter 2008 federal income tax payments we also paid 260 million in 2009 for our third and fourth quarter 2009 estimated taxes cash from operations improved 760 million in 2009 excluding this 560 million combined impact of timing differences related to our 2008 and 2009 estimated federal income tax payments this improvement was due to our focused management of working capital and reflected the significant decreases in inventory and receivable balances in 2009 compared to 2008 the reduction of cash used in investing activities was due to comparatively lower cash paid for acquisitions net payments on longterm debt of 791 million exceeded net payments in 2008 by approximately 560 million driving the increase in cash used in financing activities 

future sources and uses of cash 

as of december 31 2010 our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility provides for 2400 million in borrowing capacity under a fiveyear revolving credit facility the revolver the credit facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the revolver may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 3150 million the revolver matures on december 20 2012 

at december 31 2010 there was 987 million outstanding and 1392 million available for borrowing under the revolver in april 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our future exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the revolver this swap agreement converts the revolver’s variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 1725 on a notional amount of 500 million the swap became effective on january 27 2010 and will terminate on january 27 2012 the weighted average effective interest rate on the revolver was approximately 25 for the year ended december 31 2010 

on february 12 2007 we issued and sold 1000 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes the notes in a private placement offering pursuant to a note purchase agreement the notes are due february 12 2012 and accrue interest on the unpaid principal balance at a floating rate equal to a spread of 0600 over threemonth libor as adjusted from time to time in february 2007 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the notes the swap agreement converts the notes’ variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 5088 on the current notional amount of 500 million the weighted average effective interest rate on the notes was approximately 36 for the year ended december 31 2010 

financial covenants on our credit facility and notes are closely aligned and include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maintenance of a maximum total leverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2010 the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 

the credit facility limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in our amended credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and the dividends are declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice failure to comply with any of our financial covenants scheduled interest payments scheduled principal repayments or any other terms of our amended credit facilities could result in penalty payments higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2011 for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

 

  

  

  

  

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions since the notes are due in february 2012 we will be evaluating future financing alternatives in 2011 to replace this capacity 

as of february 22 2011 245 million of the current board authorized amount under our share repurchase program remained available we plan to continue to repurchase shares on the open market in the first half of 2011 and may use the entire remaining authorized amount depending on market conditions we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the revolver 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2010 our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 

 

 

for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments related to our longterm debt obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2010 outstanding balances of each of our debt instruments using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates for the year ended december 31 2010 for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swaps to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on information currently available related to scheduled payments and maturities of these debt instruments 

 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2010 there was no interest rate risk related to our term loan since the outstanding balance was fully hedged by one of our interest rate swaps there was also no interest rate risk related to the notional amounts under our interest rate swaps for our revolver and our notes the portions of our outstanding balances under our revolver and notes that were not covered by our interest rate swaps were subject to variable interest rates to calculate the potential impact in 2010 related to interest rate risk we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming that we borrowed the maximum available amount under our revolver excluding the accordion feature and that the variable interest rates on both the revolver and notes increased 10 based on this calculation our pretax income would have decreased by approximately 24 million and earnings per share would have decreased by 003 per diluted share based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2010 the maximum amount available under the revolver is 2400 million excluding the 750 million accordion feature 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom belgium france italy portugal spain and mexico based on the functional currencies for these international subsidiaries as shown in the table below changes in exchange rates for these currencies may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 101 of total net sales in 2010 our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in 2011 and future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

 item 1 business 

general 

based on industry data pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as pool we us or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products and one of the top three distributors of landscape and irrigation products in the united states the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products and offering a range of services to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2009 we operated 287 sales centers in north america and europe through our three distribution networks scp distributors llc scp superior pool products llc superior and horizon distributors inc horizon superior and horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of scp which is wholly owned by pool corporation 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 70 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 13 own a pool higher rates of new home construction from 1996 to 2005 have added to the market expansion opportunity for pool ownership particularly in larger pool markets 

we believe favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have and will continue to positively impact the longterm prospects of our industry these favorable trends include the following 

 

 

 

the irrigation and landscape industry has many characteristics in common with the pool industry and we believe that it benefits from the same favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends and will realize longterm growth rates similar to the pool industry 

approximately 70 of consumer spending in the pool industry is derived from the maintenance of existing swimming pools maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment such as pumps heaters filters and safety equipment creates a nondiscretionary demand for pool chemicals equipment and other related parts and supplies we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance related goods and certain discretionary products 

 

we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth historically and has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impact pool construction activities such as 2006 through 2009 

 

  

  

the table below reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground and aboveground swimming pools over the past 11 years based on company estimates and information from 2007 pk data inc reports 

 

        

the replacement and refurbish market includes major swimming pool repairs and currently accounts for approximately 20 of consumer spending in the pool industry this activity is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market new swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of the remaining consumer spending in the pool industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations 

the landscape and irrigation distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets with the majority of sales related to the residential market landscape and irrigation maintenance activities account for 40 of total spending in the irrigation industry with the remaining 60 of spending related to irrigation construction and other discretionary related products as such our irrigation business is more heavily weighted towards the sale of discretionary related products compared to our pool business 

general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp the availability of consumer credit and certain trends in the housing market affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts positive gdp trends may have a favorable impact on industry starts while negative trends may be unfavorable for industry starts we believe there is a direct correlation between industry starts and the rate of housing turnover and home appreciation over time with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit particularly as facilitated by mortgagebacked financing markets is a critical enabling factor in the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems 

the continuing adverse economic trends that began in 2006 and worsened through 2009 have negatively impacted our industry and our performance specific issues included a slowdown in the domestic housing market with lower housing turnover a sharp drop in new home construction home value deflation in many markets and a significant tightening of consumer and commercial credit the downturn in the real estate and credit markets that began in 2006 was compounded by the overall deterioration in general economic conditions in late 2008 and throughout 2009 these trends resulted in significant decreases in new construction activities and we estimate that pool construction has declined approximately 80 since 2005 pool refurbishment and replacement activities were also significantly impacted as consumers began to defer discretionary purchases as the economy worsened the impact of these trends was more severe in 2007 and 2008 in some of the largest pool markets including california florida and arizona with a more recent adverse impact in texas and other states 

since irrigation is more heavily weighted towards new construction activities this has resulted in a greater impact on our horizon business as new home and commercial construction rates have fallen we have consolidated several facilities and significantly reduced operating costs related to our horizon network and we expect these measures will mitigate the greater rate of earnings decline for our irrigation business 

 

 

  

we are encouraged by indications that the downward economic trends of the past several years are moderating which is evidenced by the fact that the level of sales declines in the major pool markets first impacted by the negative external trends diminished as 2009 progressed the landscape and irrigation markets that we participate in have not yet shown improvement as these markets tend to lag the trends in the corresponding pool markets by up to a year 

we believe there is potential for significant sales recovery over the next several years driven by both the aging of the installed base of inground pools and pentup demand for replacement and retrofit activity that consumers have deferred due to recent market conditions we also anticipate that new pool and irrigation construction activities will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels but we expect the replacement and refurbish market will rebound before the new construction market and believe it may be 2011 before there is growth in new construction activities we expect that sales levels should once again benefit from longterm industry growth dynamics and that over the longterm the industry will return to an annual growth rate of approximately 2 to 6 when the overall economy does rebound and the real estate and credit markets revert to normal 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can delay or accelerate the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer attitudes toward pool and landscape products for environmental or safety reasons 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are to promote the growth of our industry to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and to continuously strive to operate more effectively 

we promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with everything from site selection to store layout and design to business management system implementation these benefits and other exclusive services are offered through our retail brand licensing program called the backyard place ®  which is one of our key growth initiatives in return for these services customers make commitments to meet minimum purchase levels stock a minimum of nine specific product categories and operate within the backyard place ® guidelines including weekend hour requirements  we launched the backyard place ® program in 2006 and we currently have over 120 agreements with retail store customers our total sales to these customers grew 15 in 2009 compared to 2008 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management we have increased our product breadth as described in the “customers and products” section below and expanded our sales center networks through acquisitions new sales center openings and expansions of existing sales centers historically acquisitions have been an important source of sales growth 

 

 

  

since 2005 we have opened 18 new sales centers net of subsequent closings and consolidations of new sales centers and successfully completed 9 acquisitions consisting of 74 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition given the current challenging external environment we did not open any new sales centers in 2009 and expect to open only two new sales centers in 2010 we plan to continue to selectively expand our domestic swimming pool distribution networks and to take advantage of opportunities to further expand our domestic irrigation and international swimming pool distribution networks via both acquisitions and new sales center openings we plan to make strategic acquisitions to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

based upon industry data we believe our industry grew at a 2 to 6 annual rate for the period between 2000 and 2005 but contracted each year between 2006 and 2009 historically our sales growth has exceeded the industry’s growth rates and allowed us to increase market share we believe that our high service levels and expanded product offerings have also enabled us to gain market share during the past four years as our industry contracted going forward we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to increases in market share and further expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that pricing inflation has averaged 1 to 3 annually in our industry over the past 10 years in 2010 we do not expect industry price increases after experiencing above average inflationary increases in product costs in 2008 and 2009 we generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases based on the volume inventory purchases we made ahead of vendor price increases in the second half of 2008 we realized a favorable impact to gross margin in the first half of 2009 since there were no similar late season vendor price increases in 2009 we expect tough gross margin comparisons to 2009 in the first half of 2010 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 70000 customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve five types of customers 

 

 

 

 

 

the majority of these customers are small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources the current economic environment has had the greatest impact on swimming pool remodelers and builders and landscape construction companies we have seen a modest contraction in our customer base in these segments over the last three years 

we conduct our operations through over 280 sales centers in north america and europe our primary markets which have the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 51 of our net sales in 2009 we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from the sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 100000 national brand and pool corporation branded products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we track and monitor the majority of our sales by various product lines and product categories primarily for consideration in incentive plan programs and to provide support for sales and marketing efforts we currently have over 300 product lines and over 40 product categories based on our 2009 product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 17 in 2009 14 in 2008 and 12 in 2007 we attribute this growth to increases in our market share a shift in product mix resulting from the decline in construction related products and chemical price increases no other product category accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

we categorize our maintenance repair and replacement products into the following two groupings 

 

 

maintenance and minor repair products are primarily nondiscretionary in nature meaning that these items must be purchased by end users to maintain existing swimming pools and landscaped areas in 2009 the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for approximately 70 of our sales and gross profits while approximately 30 of sales and gross profits were derived from the replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of pools and landscaping this reflects a shift toward more sales of maintenance and minor repair products due to the significant declines in new pool construction over the past four years historically just over 50 of our total sales and gross profits were related to maintenance and repair products 

with our acquisition of national pool tile npt in 2008 our focus in 2009 included expanding the number of sales center locations that offer npt’s tile and composite pool finish products another recent example of our product initiatives is the expansion of our replacement parts offerings this includes the continued expansion of our pool corporation branded products which has contributed to our improvement of gross margin 

complementary product sales have also been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth but have declined over the past several years since the majority of these products are related to construction activities or are discretionary by nature we continue to identify other product categories that could become part of our complementary product offerings in the future we typically introduce two to three categories each year in certain markets we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those which we believe exhibit longterm growth potential we intend to continue to expand our complementary products initiative by increasing the number of locations which offer complementary products increasing the number of complementary products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of the product offerings on a companywide basis 

operating strategy 

we operate three distribution networks the scp network the superior network and the horizon network the scp network consists of 168 sales centers including 12 sales centers in europe the superior network consists of 62 sales centers and the horizon network consists of 57 sales centers we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products through our scp and superior networks and we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network 

  

  

we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services including customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

we also operate 10 centralized shipping locations that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or directly to customers 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms are typically available to us for preseason or early season purchases 

we initiated a preferred vendor program in 1999 which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors we work closely with these vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our purchasing activities these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have resulted in improved margins at the sales center level 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 16 10 and 8 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2009 

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of landscape and irrigation products in the united states and we compete against one national wholesale distributor of these products we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal distribution networks 

some geographic markets we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona are more competitive than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brandname products if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights we might be materially and adversely affected we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 

 

 

  

we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3200 people at december 31 2009 given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer and depending on expected sales levels we add 200 to 500 employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool and related outdoor lifestyle products has been and may continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for approximately 90 of our net sales and gross profits the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends between late 2006 and 2009 a weakening economy may also cause deferrals of discretionary replacement and refurbish activity in addition even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit particularly as facilitated by mortgagebacked financing markets is a critical enabling factor in the purchase of new pool and irrigation systems the recent unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market have resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which has limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pool and irrigation systems if these trends continue or worsen many consumers will likely not be able to obtain financing for pool and irrigation projects which could negatively impact our sales of construction related products 

  

  

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products drought conditions or water management initiatives may lead to municipal ordinances related to water use restrictions which could result in decreased pool and irrigation system installations and negatively impact our sales while warmer weather conditions favorably impact our sales global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the shortterm or lead to other unfavorable weather conditions that could adversely impact our sales or operations for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to the success of our business we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool supply chain and landscape supply chain by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 16 10 and 8 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2009 a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retail customers and other endusers of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to other distributors retail customers or end user consumers could also adversely affect our business we dedicate significant resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe greatly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers and large pool or landscape supply retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 51 of our net sales in 2009 also tend to be more competitive than others 

more aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

  

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for direct and enduse customers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

  

  

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

historically we have experienced substantial sales growth through acquisitions market share gains and new sales center openings that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution during the past five fiscal years we have opened 18 new sales centers net of subsequent closings and consolidations of new sales centers and have completed 9 acquisitions these acquisitions have added 74 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition to our distribution networks between 2007 and 2009 we also closed or consolidated 12 existing sales centers while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

the growth of our business depends on effective marketing programs 

the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base thus an important part of our strategy is to promote the growth of the pool industry through our extensive advertising and promotional programs that attempt to raise consumer awareness regarding the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns we believe these programs benefit the entire supply chain from our suppliers to our customers 

we also promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our programs include such features as personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training we also provide certain retail store customers with assistance in site selection store layout and design and business management system implementation our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising marketing and promotional programs to succeed in a weakened economic environment and an increasingly competitive marketplace in which we and our entire supply chain also compete with other luxury product alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2009 approximately 67 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year which represent the peak months of swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

 

 

  

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 20 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

we source certain products we sell including our pool corporation branded products from asia and other international sources there is a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner and we may also be subject to certain trade restrictions that prevent us from obtaining products fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs currency exchange rates transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or longterm in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporate offices which consist of approximately 50000 square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50 ownership interest we own three sales center facilities in florida and one in texas we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three to seven year terms as of december 31 2009 we had 18 leases with remaining terms longer than seven years that expire between 2017 and 2027 most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000 square feet to 100000 square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls range in size from 16000 square feet to 78000 square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market under performing or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2009 financial overview 

financial results 

we believe our 2009 financial results reflect our ability to capitalize on our financial and operational strengths and provide evidence of our resiliency given the most difficult external market environment ever faced by our industry we achieved many of our 2009 objectives by focusing on disciplined pricing and purchasing strategies driving record gross margin rebalancing inventories and improving working capital management leading to record cash from operations and controlling costs relative to our current sales levels we believe that we realized continued market share gains which we attribute to our high service levels coupled with growth initiatives that included the expansion of product category offerings in tile and replacement parts 

net sales decreased 14 compared to 2008 due to a 15 decline in base business sales which reflects the prolonged impact of lower pool and irrigation construction activity greater deferred discretionary replacement activity and unfavorable weather and currency fluctuations these reductions were partially offset by an increase in certain maintenance and repair product sales inflationary price increases that we passed through the supply chain and sales for new drains and related safety products as a result of the virginia graeme baker pool and spa safety act vgb act for a discussion of our base business calculation see the results of operations section below 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin increased 30 basis points to 292 in 2009 as favorable shifts in product mix and continued improvements in margin management practices helped offset negative pressures from the competitive pricing environment 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses for 2009 decreased 10 compared to 2008 this decrease reflects the impact of cost control initiatives including lower payroll related variable and discretionary expenses and reduced delivery and vehicle operating costs these results include 14 million of noncash charges in the second half of 2009 related to the closure and consolidation of certain sales centers between september and december 2009 

operating income declined 23 to 884 million in 2009 while operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin decreased to 57 in 2009 compared to 64 in 2008 interest expense net declined 92 million compared to 2008 due primarily to a 41 decrease in interest expense and 18 million of foreign currency transaction gains 

as we reported in our third quarter 2009 results we recognized a 265 million equity loss related to our pro rata share of latham acquisition corporation’s lac noncash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge since our prorata share of this charge exceeded the 265 million recorded value of our investment in lac as of september 1 2009 the recognized loss reflected the full writeoff of the investment prior to this we had recognized an equity loss of 22 million related to our share of lac’s loss from ongoing operations for the eight months ended august 2009 in total we recognized an equity loss of 287 million for lac in 2009 this compares to an equity loss of 17 million recognized in fiscal 2008 lac filed for bankruptcy in december 2009 and its plan of reorganization was approved by the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware in january 2010 allowing it to emerge from bankruptcy as of the date of the approval we no longer have an equity interest in lac and will not recognize any impact related to lac’s future earnings or losses we did not recognize any tax benefits related to the writedown of our equity investment in lac 

earnings per share for 2009 was 039 per diluted share on net income of 192 million compared to earnings per share of 117 per diluted share on net income of 570 million in 2008 the 078 decrease in diluted earnings per share includes a decline of approximately 059 per diluted share related to our equity investment in lac 054 of which is related to our prorata share of lac’s impairment charge 

  

  

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations increased 200 million to 1133 million in 2009 in january 2009 we paid 300 million for our deferred third and fourth quarter 2008 federal income tax payments we also paid 260 million in 2009 for our third and fourth quarter 2009 estimated taxes excluding this 560 million combined impact of timing differences related to 2008 and 2009 estimated federal income tax payments cash from operations improved 760 million in 2009 this improvement is due to our focused management of working capital and reflects the decrease in inventory discussed below cash provided by operations helped fund the following in 2009 

 

 

 

 

 

total net receivables decreased 17 to 964 million at december 31 2009 from 1156 million at december 31 2008 due to the lower sales a shift toward more cash sales as a result of tighter credit terms and a 23 million decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects writeoffs of certain accounts that were fully reserved and some improvement in our past due receivable balances year over year days sales outstanding dso decreased to 349 days at december 31 2009 from 363 days at december 31 2008 

our inventory levels decreased 12 to 3555 million as of december 31 2009 compared to 4059 million as of december 31 2008 excluding approximately 80 million of inventory related to the acquisition of gps inventories declined 14 year over year due to the success of our inventory rebalancing efforts and the decrease in sales our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis slowed to 30 times as of december 31 2009 compared to 31 times as of december 31 2008 

current trends 

continuing adverse economic trends have significantly impacted our industry these trends include a slowdown in the domestic housing market with lower housing turnover sharp drops in new home construction home value deflation in many markets and a significant tightening of consumer and commercial credit additionally general economic conditions have been weak including declines in gross domestic product gdp during the first nine months of 2009 and high unemployment rates some of the factors that help mitigate the impact of these negative trends on our business include the following 

 

 

despite these mitigating factors the negative trends noted above have significantly impacted a number of our key markets including california florida and arizona with a more recent adverse impact in texas and other states we estimate that these trends resulted in the following decreases in new pool construction in the united states since peaking in 2005 at approximately 210000 new units 

 

  

 

since these trends worsened from 2006 through 2009 they had a more pronounced impact on our results in 2008 and 2009 however as evidenced by moderating base business sales declines throughout 2009 in florida california and arizona including some month over month sales growth and essentially flat fourth quarter sales in florida compared to the same periods in 2008 we believe these trends have begun to level off in certain major pool markets first impacted by the housing market downturn 

outlook 

our key 2010 objectives are consistent with 2009 and include the following 

 

 

 

 

while we believe that the level of declines in new construction activity peaked in 2009 we expect the ongoing housing market and general economic downturns will continue to pressure new pool and irrigation construction activity in 2010 however we anticipate a relatively stable maintenance market based on the increased installed based of swimming pools and the potential for higher replacement and refurbish activity due to recent pentup demand caused by consumer’s decisions to defer discretionary purchases we expect that sales levels relative to 2009 will be lower in the first quarter of 2010 but should gradually improve throughout the remainder of the year with comparatively higher sales levels anticipated in the second half of 2010 the first half of 2009 included approximately 170 million of increased sales for new drains and related safety products as a result of the virginia graeme baker pool and spa safety act vgb act and we do not expect any significant sales activity related to the vgb act in 2010 

in 2010 we do not anticipate any inflationary product cost increases given the competitive pricing environment and the favorable impact to gross margin in the first half of 2009 based on our volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in the second half of 2008 we believe gross margin could drop off modestly in the first half of 2010 however we expect gross margin will be essentially flat for the full year compared to 2009 

while we continue to drive targeted expense reductions the rate of these decreases should continue to moderate throughout 2010 as we lap more of the impact of cost measures implemented in 2009 in 2010 we expect interest expense will continue to decline based on lower projected average borrowings excluding any acquisition activity we plan to open two new sales centers in 2010 

based on current trends including the unfavorable weather conditions during the first two months of 2010 we project that 2010 earnings per share will be in the range of 100 to 115 per diluted share this range includes our expectation for a higher seasonal loss per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 with gradually improving year on year comparisons as 2010 progresses the lower end of this range assumes earnings results consistent with fiscal 2009 but includes the comparative benefits from lower expected interest expense the projected accretive impact of the gps acquisition of approximately 002 per diluted share and the fact that there will be no impact from lac since we no longer have an equity interest in lac as of january 2010 

we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2010 but will be comparatively lower than 2009 because we will not realize the same level of improvements from our ongoing working capital management initiatives 

the forwardlooking statements in this outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from 01 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than 20000 additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote such writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 02 of net sales annually however writeoffs as a percentage of net sales was 04 in 2009 and 03 in 2008 reflecting a trend related to the negative impacts on some of our customer’s businesses due to the difficult external environment 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2009 pretax income would change by approximately 23 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 003 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2009 

  

  

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity sales centers classify products into 13 classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months all inventory is included in these classes except for nonstock special order items and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 

 

there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage on a companywide basis we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2009 pretax income would change by approximately 16 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 002 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2009 

vendor incentives 

we account for vendor incentives in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 605502510 customer’s accounting for certain consideration received from a vendor many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor incentives as if they are a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

  

  

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of cumulative purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for cumulative purchases and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our gross margins for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2009 and in accordance with the provisions of asc 740 income taxes  united states taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

  

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions   

we have operations in 38 states and 7 foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

incentive compensation accrual 

we have an incentive compensation structure designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses as a percentage of salaries based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year 

management sets the objectives for our bonus plans at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record an incentive compensation accrual at the end of each month using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved towards the stated bonus plan objectives during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans 

  

our estimated quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

 

 

impairment of goodwill and equity method investments 

goodwill 

our largest intangible asset is goodwill at december 31 2009 our goodwill balance was 1769 million representing 24 of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we account for goodwill under the provisions of asc 35020 goodwill  under these rules we test goodwill for impairment annually or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units has fallen below their carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units’ goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units’ goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income since we define our operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center 

in september 2009 we closed one of our horizon sales centers in texas as a result we performed an interim impairment test to determine the implied fair value of this reporting unit’s goodwill since the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value we wrote off 03 million of goodwill related to this reporting unit this impairment expense is recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income 

in october 2009 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2009 we had 203 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances the highest goodwill balance is 71 million for our uk reporting unit for the other reporting units the highest goodwill balance is 57 million and the average goodwill balance is 08 million we estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing a fair value model which requires us to make several assumptions about projected future cash flows discount rates and multiples in order to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value estimates we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate based on our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the goodwill attributed to all of our reporting units is not impaired 

if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change we could incur impairment charges in future periods which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet for example we performed a sensitivity test for the two key assumptions in our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that an increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital of 50 basis points or a decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate of 1 could have resulted in the estimated fair value of four reporting units falling below their carrying values the calculated goodwill impairment based on this sensitivity test was approximately 06 million combined for all four reporting units overall we believe that our reporting units most at risk for goodwill impairment include the uk spain and one new jersey location based on the combination of their higher goodwill balances and 2009 operating results at approximately break even levels due to the impacts of the current adverse external market environment 

  

  

equity method investments 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had two equity method investments consisting of our 38 investment in latham acquisition corporation lac and our 50 investment in northpark corporate center we account for these investments in accordance with asc 323 investmentsequity method and joint ventures  

we evaluate our equity method investments for potential impairment indicators on an ongoing basis this evaluation requires the exercise of judgment based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each investment a series of actual operating losses or projected future losses of an investee or other factors may indicate a decrease in value of the investment if impairment indicators exist we will evaluate whether the impairment is otherthantemporary impairment is measured by comparing the investment carrying amount to the estimated fair value of the investment 

as of december 31 2008 the carrying value of our investments was 312 million including 301 million for lac based on the fact that lac’s results had deteriorated due to external market conditions including a net loss in 2008 and our expectations for a continued difficult environment in 2009 we considered other relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether there was an indicator of a decrease in the value of our investment as of december 31 2008 and if so whether it reflected an otherthantemporary impairment in evaluating the value of our investment in lac we considered the following 

 

 

 

 

 

using the criteria listed above we determined that there was no impairment of our equity method investments as of december 31 2008 

in 2009 lac had a net loss for the six months ended june 2009 as its second quarter net income was not enough to offset its first quarter seasonal loss as of june 30 2009 we determined that there were no significant changes in lac’s longterm financial projections or the other factors we consider in performing our evaluation for indicators of a potential decrease in the value of our investments that may result in otherthantemporary impairments 

in the third quarter of 2009 lac identified indicators of impairment based on an evaluation of its future capital requirements that required it to perform an interim impairment assessment of its goodwill and other intangible assets on september 1 2009 lac   recorded a noncash impairment charge based on its interim impairment test since our pro rata share of this impairment charge exceeded our equity investment balance we recognized a 265 million equity loss equal to our equity investment balance as of september 1 2009 reducing the value of our investment in lac to zero in december 2009 lac filed for bankruptcy and its plan of reorganization was approved by the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware in january 2010 allowing it to emerge from bankruptcy as of january 2010 we no longer have an equity interest in lac and will not recognize any impact related to lac’s future earnings or losses

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2009 2008 and 2007 we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 

 

  

  

we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified 

 

 

 

we exclude the following sales centers from base business results for a period of 15 months parenthetical numbers for each category indicate the number of sales centers excluded as of december 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

 

since we divested our pool liner manufacturing operation in france at the beginning of april 2008 we also excluded these operations from base business for the comparative three month period ended march 31 2008 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2009 

 

for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 

 

the new pool and irrigation construction markets continue to face unprecedented adverse conditions created by the combination of significant declines in the real estate and the mortgagebacked financing markets coupled with the severely depressed economic environment in 2009 these external factors have placed considerable pressure on our top line results as a result our sales were negatively impacted as construction activities remained depressed and consumers continued to defer discretionary replacement purchases 

 

 

  

base business sales decreased 15 compared to 2008 including a 12 decline on the swimming pool side of the business and a 37 decline on the irrigation side of the business which is more heavily weighted toward new construction and discretionary product sales overall weather conditions were unfavorable compared to the same period in 2008 see discussion of significant weather impacts under the heading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations beginning on page 32 unfavorable currency fluctuations also resulted in a decrease in sales of approximately 1 

the overall decrease in net sales was partially offset by the following 

 

 

 

 

 

our sales growth for mrr products was primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

gross profit 

 

in 2009 gross margin increased 30 basis points compared to 2008 as a shift in sales mix to products in the higher margin maintenance and repair market and specific margin improvement initiatives helped offset the adverse impact on gross margins due to the tough competitive pricing environment g ross margin increased 60 basis points in the first half of 2009 but was flat in the second half of 2009 for the year favorable impacts compared to 2008 included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

 

 

  

  

operating expenses 

 

the decrease in operating expenses reflects a 10 decline in base business operating expenses due primarily to the impact of our cost control initiatives including lower payroll related variable and discretionary expenses average monthly total headcount in 2009 decreased 10 compared to 2008 driving a 9 decline in total labor and related costs total delivery expenses declined 25 reflecting lower delivery volumes and decreases in both vehicle operating expenses including lower fuel costs and vehicle rental expenses most discretionary expenses declined compared to 2008 including a 21 million decrease in advertising costs bad debt expense also decreased 52 million as the rate of customer payment issues has fallen after peaking at the end of the 2008 season 

the decrease in base business operating expenses was partially offset by the impact of our acquired sales centers during the first quarter of 2009 we realized approximately 20 million in operating expenses related to our 2008 acquisitions and we incurred 15 million of operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to our acquisition of gps despite the decrease in headcount employee insurance costs increased 16 million compared to 2008 due primarily to several high dollar claims in the fourth quarter of 2009 total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased between periods due to the decrease in net sales 

interest expense 

interest expense net declined 92 million compared to 2008 due primarily to a 41 decrease in interest expense and 18 million of foreign currency transaction gains interest expense declined due to a 17 lower average outstanding debt balance and a decrease in the weighted average effective interest rate to 34 in 2009 from 48 2008 

income taxes 

the decrease in income taxes is due to the decrease in income before income taxes and equity earnings loss our effective income tax rate was 3930 at december 31 2009 and 3926 at december 31 2008 

net income and earnings per share 

net income decreased to 192 million in 2009 compared to 570 million in 2008 earnings per share for 2009 decreased to 039 per diluted share compared to 117 in 2008 the 078 decrease in diluted earnings per share reflects the 054 per diluted share impact of lac’s impairment charge included in the reported equity loss for 2009 the dilutive impact of our fourth quarter 2009 acquisition was approximately 001 per diluted share for 2009 

 

  

  

fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 

 

for an explanation of how we calculate base business please refer to the discussion of base business on page 27 under the heading “fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008” 

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2008 to the year ended december 31 2007 we have excluded acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below as of december 31 2008 we also excluded seven existing sales centers consolidated with acquired sales centers four closed sales centers and one consolidated sales center from base business in addition to the 22 total sales centers excluded from base business as of december 31 2008 there were two sales centers opened in new markets that were excluded from january to may 2008 before they became base business sales centers in june 2008 since we divested our pool liner manufacturing operation in france in april 2008 we also excluded these operations from base business for the comparative nine month period ended december 31 2007 

 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2008 

 

    we acquired a single location in spain and consolidated it with our existing madrid sales center operations 

  we acquired 15 npt sales centers and consolidated 6 of these with existing sales centers in 2008 including 4 in march 2008 and 2 in the second quarter of 2008 

for information about our 2008 and 2007 acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

  

  

net sales 

 

during 2008 new pool and irrigation construction markets continued to face unprecedented adverse conditions created by the combination of significant declines in the real estate and mortgagebacked financing markets as a result our 2008 sales were negatively impacted with a more profound effect on pool and irrigation construction product sales the decrease in net sales was more pronounced in our seasonally slow fourth quarter declining 14 compared to the same period in 2007 as the economy worsened and consumers began to defer more discretionary repair and replacement purchases 

base business sales decreased 9 compared to 2007 including an 8 decline on the swimming pool side of the business and an 18 decrease on the irrigation side of the business this impact was more concentrated in markets that had the greatest runup in real estate values between 2000 and 2006 which includes a number of our larger markets in florida arizona and parts of california the decline in new pool construction negatively impacted complementary product sales which decreased 15 compared to 2007 overall weather conditions were unfavorable compared to the same period in 2007 

the overall decrease in net sales was partially offset by increases due to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

our sales growth for mrr products was primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

gross profit 

 

despite the tough competitive pricing environment gross margin increased 140 basis points compared to 2007   the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to our focus on pricing discipline at the sales center level other favorable impacts compared to 2007 included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

operating expenses 

 

the increase in operating expenses was due to approximately 145 million of operating expenses related to our 2008 acquisitions which was partially offset by a 3 decrease in base business operating expenses compared to 2007 the impact of cost control initiatives offset higher building rental expenses of 26 million primarily for sales centers opened or expanded during 2007 an increase in bad debt expense of 22 million higher product delivery costs and inflationary increases in wages and other costs total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased between periods due to the decrease in net sales 

our cost control initiatives include tighter management of discretionary costs the consolidation or closing of nine sales centers since november 2007 and selective personnel reductions over the past year despite the 6 reduction in headcount year over year excluding acquisitions we still reduced overtime and temporary labor costs by 45 million compared to 2007 incentive expenses declined 38 million and employee insurance costs also decreased due primarily to lower claims expense 

interest expense 

interest expense net decreased 15 between periods as the impact of a decrease in our weighted average effective interest rate for the period more than offset our higher average debt outstanding balance average debt outstanding was 3 higher for the year ended 2008 reflecting our increased borrowings during the first half of 2008 that funded our march 2008 acquisitions the weighted average effective interest rate decreased to 48 in 2008 from 60 in 2007 

income taxes 

the decrease in income taxes is due to the decrease in income before income taxes and equity earnings loss our effective income tax rate was 3926 at december 31 2008 and 3866 at december 31 2007 the increase in the effective income tax rate reflects a valuation allowance established for annual losses from certain foreign operations 

net income and earnings per share 

net income decreased 18 to 570 million in 2008 earnings per share for 2008 as adjusted in 2009 for the adoption of asc 260104561a decreased to 117 per diluted share compared to 137 in 2007 the dilutive impact of our first quarter acquisitions was approximately 002 per diluted share for 2008 in both periods earnings per share benefited from the reduction of our weighted average shares outstanding due to the impact of our 2007 share repurchase activities this included an accretive impact of approximately 002 in 2008 and 001 in 2007 

  

  

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2009 approximately 67 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august our debt levels peaked a little earlier in 2009 based on early payments we made in the first six months of 2009 to take advantage of preprice increase inventory purchases and early payment discounts offered by certain vendors 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2009 and 2008 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of the swimming pool industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 

 

  note due to rounding the sum of quarterly percentage amounts may not equal 100 

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season starts or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

  

  

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 

 

 

 

while weather conditions in the first quarter of 2009 were generally favorable compared to the same period last year we did not realize any positive impact on sales given the overriding adverse economic environment unfavorable weather delayed the start of the pool season in both 2008 and 2009 in a number of our markets with the 2009 season adversely impacted in most markets by much colder than normal temperatures in april throughout the second quarter of 2009 weather conditions were unfavorable overall and adversely impacted sales due to cold and wet conditions in the midwest and northeast the southwest also experienced unseasonably cool and wet weather during june our third quarter 2009 sales were also negatively impacted due to much colder than normal temperatures that shortened the pool season in most central and northern markets and higher than normal rainfall in the south central united states consistent with the third quarter of 2008 weather conditions were favorable in the western us and florida due to warmer than average temperatures however near record precipitation across most of the central and southeast regions and much colder than average temperatures in the western half of the united states negatively impacted our fourth quarter sales 

in the first half of 2008 our sales benefited from more favorable weather in texas and oklahoma compared to the same period in 2007 see discussion below however our sales were negatively impacted in 2008 by generally unfavorable weather conditions including cooler temperatures and higher precipitation nationally compared to 2007 the start of the 2008 pool season was delayed even further than in 2007 due to several late winter storms in the midwest and northeast and much cooler march temperatures across most of the country cooler than normal temperatures in august and september also shortened the pool season in 2008 for most north american markets excluding the west coast while a number of severe tropical systems adversely impacted our sales in texas florida and louisiana during the third quarter of 2008 

in 2007 our sales were negatively impacted by extended winter conditions that delayed the start of the pool season in the northeast compared to 2006 much cooler and unusually wet weather conditions in texas and oklahoma during the first seven months of 2007 which had a significant impact on sales related to pool and landscape construction and less than ideal conditions in the third quarter which compared unfavorably to the same period in 2006 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions dividend payments and share repurchases our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which combined with seller financing have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business maintaining a prudent debt structure and returning money to our shareholders our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

 

 

 

while we still have our board authorized share repurchase program in place with 530 million of the current authorized amount remaining available as of december 31 2009 this is not a current priority for the use of cash 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 

 

cash provided by operations increased 200 million to 1133 million in 2009 compared to 2008 in january 2009 we paid 300 million for our deferred third and fourth quarter 2008 federal income tax payments we also paid 260 million in 2009 for our third and fourth quarter 2009 estimated taxes cash from operations improved 760 million in 2009 excluding this 560 million combined impact of timing differences related to our 2008 and 2009 estimated federal income tax payments this improvement is due to our focused management of working capital and reflects the significant decrease in inventory the reduction of cash used in investing activities is due to comparatively lower cash paid for acquisitions net payments on longterm debt of 791 million exceeded last year’s net payments by approximately 560 million driving the increase in cash used in financing activities 

cash provided by operations in 2008 increased 216 million compared to 2007 due primarily to the favorable impact from the reduction in outstanding accounts receivable our 2008 cash provided by operating activities also reflects the benefit related to our 300 million deferred third and fourth quarter 2008 estimated federal tax payments as allowed by the internal revenue service irs for taxpayers affected by hurricane gustav this benefit was offset by a negative impact of approximately 360 million related to the net purchase and payment of inventory we purchased ahead of vendor price increases in 2008 the increase in cash used in investing activities reflects cash paid for our march 2008 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures cash used in financing activities in 2008 includes 231 million of net payments on debt 

  

  

future sources and uses of cash 

our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility provides for 3000 million in borrowing capacity including a 2400 million fiveyear revolving credit facility the revolver and a term loan the term loan with an original principal amount of 600 million 

at december 31 2009 there was 1007 million outstanding and 1385 million available for borrowing under the revolver the revolver matures on december 20 2012 the weighted average effective interest rate on the revolver was approximately 19 for the year ended december 31 2009 in april 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our future exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the revolver this swap agreement will convert the revolver’s variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 1725 on a notional amount of 500 million the swap has an effective date of january 27 2010 and will terminate on january 27 2012 

at december 31 2009 there was 480 million outstanding under the term loan we have remaining principal payments on the term loan of 120 million per quarter in 2010 and we intend to fund these payments by using cash provided by operations and borrowings under our revolver our current interest rate swap agreement reduces our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates for the remaining outstanding period of the term loan by converting our variable rate to a fixed rate basis this swap will terminate when the term loan matures on december 20 2010 the weighted average effective interest rate on the term loan was approximately 32 for the year ended december 31 2009 

the credit facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the revolver may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 3150 million 

on february 12 2007 we issued and sold 1000 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes the notes in a private placement offering pursuant to a note purchase agreement the notes are due february 12 2012 and accrue interest on the unpaid principal balance at a floating rate equal to a spread of 0600 over the threemonth libor as adjusted from time to time in february 2007 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the notes the swap agreement converts the notes’ variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 5088 on the initial notional amount of 1000 million which decreased to a notional amount of 500 million in february 2010 the effective interest rate on the notes was approximately 5688 for the year ended december 31 2009 

financial covenants on our credit facility and notes are closely aligned and include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maintenance of a maximum total leverage ratio which are our most restrictive financial covenants as of december 31 2009 the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below 

 

 

  

  

the credit facility limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50 of the preceding year’s net income as defined in our amended credit facility provided no default or event of default has occurred and the dividends are declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice failure to comply with any of our financial covenants scheduled interest payments scheduled principal repayments or any other terms of our amended credit facilities could result in penalty payments higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements 

on february 26 2010 we amended certain provisions in our credit facility to increase the dividend limitation in 2010 from 50 to 55 of our 2009 net income we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2010 for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions 

as of february 22 2010 530 million of the current board authorized amount under our share repurchase program remained available while share repurchases are not a current priority we may continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we may use cash flows from operations to fund these purchases or we may incur additional debt 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2009 our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 

 

for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments related to our longterm debt obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2009 outstanding balances of each of our debt instruments and the related effective interest rates for the year ended december 31 2009 on our term loan and our notes the variable rates are converted to fixed rates under our existing swap agreements  to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on information currently available related to scheduled payments and maturities of these debt instruments 

 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates for information about our debt arrangements and interest rate swaps see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2009 there was no interest rate risk related to our term loan and our notes since the outstanding balances were fully hedged by our interest rate swaps if the variable rates on our revolver and our receivables facility increased 10 from the rate at december 31 2009 and we borrowed the maximum available amounts under these arrangements during 2009 then our pretax income would decrease by approximately 35 million and earnings per share would decrease by 004 per diluted share based on the number of weighed average diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2009 the maximum amount available under the revolver is 3150 million assuming that we exercised the 750 million accordion feature 

failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom france italy portugal spain and mexico based on the functional currencies for these international subsidiaries as shown in the table below changes in exchange rates for these currencies may positively or negatively impact our sales operating expenses and earnings historically we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results while our international operations accounted for only 95 of total net sales in 2009 significantly higher volatility in these exchange rates in both 2008 and 2009 had a greater impact on our consolidated results despite the relative small size of our international operations our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in future years to the extent that either currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results

part iv 




 item 1 business 

general 

based on industry data pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as pool we us or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products and offering a range of services to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2008 we operated 288 sales centers in north america and europe 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 70 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 12 own a pool higher rates of new home construction from 1996 to 2005 have added to the market expansion opportunity for pool ownership particularly in larger pool markets 

we believe the longterm prospects of our industry are positively impacted by favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends this includes the expected continued longterm growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration towards the south and the need to maintain the growing installed base of pools the industry has also been positively impacted by the trend for increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment additionally consumers frequently bundle the purchase of a pool with other products as part of a complete backyard makeover new irrigation systems and landscaping are often key components to completing a swimming pool installation or remodel the irrigation and landscape market has many characteristics in common with the pool industry and we believe that it benefits from the same favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends and will realize longterm growth rates similar to the pool industry 

the majority of consumer spending in our industry is derived from the nondiscretionary maintenance of existing swimming pools including the maintenance and repair of the equipment for those pools we believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth historically and has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impact pool construction activities the table below reflects growth in the domestic installed base of inground and aboveground swimming pools over the past 10 years based on company estimates and information from 2007 pk data inc reports 

 

 

  

  

new swimming pool construction and irrigation starts comprise the bulk of the remaining consumer spending in our industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations 

general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp the availability of consumer credit and certain trends in the housing market affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts positive gdp trends may have a favorable impact on industry starts while negative trends may be unfavorable for industry starts we believe there is a direct correlation between industry starts and the rate of housing turnover and home appreciation over time with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on starts over time we also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit particularly as facilitated by mortgagebacked financing markets is a critical enabling factor in the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems 

in 2008 the continuing adverse economic trends that carried over and intensified from 2007 negatively impacted our industry and our performance these trends were more severe in some of the largest pool markets including california florida and arizona specific issues included a slowdown in the domestic housing market with lower housing turnover a sharp drop in new home construction home value deflation in many markets and a significant tightening of consumer and commercial credit our expectation is that these trends will continue in 2009 but over the longterm the industry will return to an annual growth rate of approximately 2 to 6 when the overall economy rebounds and the real estate and credit markets revert to normal 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can delay or accelerate the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer attitudes toward pool and landscape products for environmental or safety reasons 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are to promote the growth of our industry to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and to continuously strive to operate more effectively 

we promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with everything from site selection to store layout and design to business management system implementation these benefits and other exclusive services are offered through our retail brand licensing program called the backyard place which is one of our key growth initiatives in return for these services customers make commitments to meet minimum purchase levels stock a minimum of nine specific product categories and operate within the backyard place guidelines including weekend hour requirements  since we launched the backyard place program in 2006 we have signed agreements with more than 100 retail store customers and have realized over a 20 growth in our sales to these customers 

 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management we have increased our product breadth as described in the “customers and products” section below and expanded our sales center networks through acquisitions which have been an important source of sales growth new sales center openings and expansions of existing sales centers since 2004 we have opened 31 new sales centers net of subsequent closings and consolidations of new sales centers and successfully completed 9 acquisitions consisting of 69 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition given the current challenging external environment we opened only one new sales center location in 2008 and do not expect to open any additional sales centers in 2009 however we plan to take advantage of opportunities to further expand our domestic irrigation and international swimming pool distribution networks via acquisitions and new openings we also plan to selectively expand our domestic swimming pool distribution networks and continue to grow our complementary product offerings 

based upon industry data we believe the industry grew at a 2 to 6 annual rate for the period between 2000 and 2005 but declined between 2006 and 2008 historically our sales growth has exceeded the industry’s growth rates and allowed us to increase market share we expect our sales growth to be higher than the industry average due to increases in market share and expansion of our product offerings 

we estimate that pricing inflation has averaged 13 annually in our industry over the past 10 years however we anticipate mid to high single digit inflationary increases in product costs in 2009 we intend to pass these price increases through the supply chain and we expect a favorable impact to gross margin in 2009 based on our volume of inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in the second half of 2008 

for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k we intend to pursue additional strategic acquisitions which will allow us to further penetrate existing markets and expand into new geographic markets and product categories 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 70000 customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve five types of customers 

 

 

 

 

 

the majority of these customers are small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources the current economic environment has had the greatest impact on swimming pool remodelers and builders and landscape construction companies we have seen a modest contraction in our customer base in these segments over the last two years 

we conduct our operations through 288 sales centers in north america and europe our primary markets which have the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 55 of our net sales in 2008 we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from the sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

  

  

we offer our customers more than 100000 national brand and pool corporation private label products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we track and monitor the majority of our sales by various product lines and product categories primarily for consideration in various incentive plan programs and to provide support for sales and marketing efforts we currently have over 300 product lines and over 40 product categories based on our 2008 product classifications sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 14 in 2008 12 in 2007 and 11 in 2006 this growth has been due to both increases in our market share and a shift in product mix resulting from the decline in construction related products no other product categories accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 

our maintenance repair and replacement products are categorized into maintenance and minor repair nondiscretionary and major repair and refurbishment partially discretionary product groupings since maintenance and repair products are primarily nondiscretionary in nature these items must be purchased by end users to maintain existing swimming pools and landscaped areas in 2008 approximately 60 of our sales and gross profits were derived from the sale of maintenance and repair products used to maintain and repair these existing features and approximately 40 were derived from the replacement construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of pools and landscaping this reflects a shift toward more sales of maintenance and repair products due to the significant declines in new pool construction over the past three years historically just over 50 of our total sales and gross profits were related to maintenance and repair products 

including sales related to our march 2008 acquisition of national pool tile group inc npt our complementary product sales accounted for approximately 11 of our total net sales in 2008 at comparable margins to our traditional product offerings while complementary product sales excluding npt decreased 15 in 2008 due primarily to the downturn in new pool and irrigation construction complementary product sales have been an important factor in our base business sales growth and increased from approximately 30 million in 1999 to over 1560 million in 2008 with our acquisition of npt in march 2008 our focus in 2009 will be expanding the number of sales center locations that offer npt’s pool tile and composite pool finish products 

we continue to identify other product categories that could become part of our complementary product offerings in the future we typically introduce two to three categories each year in certain markets we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those which we believe exhibit longterm growth potential we intend to continue to expand our complementary products initiative by increasing the number of locations which offer complementary products increasing the number of complementary products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of the product offerings on a companywide basis 

in 2009 we will change how we track complementary product sales some landscape products including power lawn equipment will now be tracked as complementary products while other products previously captured as complementary that are part of the cost of building or remodeling a pool will now be tracked as pool product sales including products such as plaster cement tile coping etc as such we will not report complementary product sales amounts in the future that are comparable with the amounts discussed above 

  

  

operating strategy 

we operate three distribution networks the scp distributors scp network the superior pool products superior network and the horizon network the scp network consists of 167 sales centers including 12 sales centers in europe the superior network consists of 60 sales centers and the horizon network consists of 61 sales centers 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products through our scp and superior networks and we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services including customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

in addition we operate seven centralized shipping locations and six standalone construction materials centers that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or directly to customers 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms are typically available to us for preseason or early season purchases 

we initiated a preferred vendor program in 1999 which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors we work closely with these vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and concentrate our purchasing activities these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have resulted in improved margins at the sales center level 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 15 10 and 9 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2008 

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of landscape and irrigation products in the united states and we compete against one national wholesale distributor of these products we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal distribution networks 

 

 

 

some geographic markets we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona are more competitive than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brandname products if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights we might be materially and adversely affected we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 

we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements include the following 

the demand for our swimming pool and related outdoor lifestyle products has been and may continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools currently account for more than 80 of our net sales and gross profits the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends in 2007 and 2008 a weakening economy may also cause deferrals of discretionary replacement and refurbish activity in addition even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

 

 

 

we believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit particularly as facilitated by mortgagebacked financing markets is a critical enabling factor in the purchase of new pool and irrigation systems the recent unfavorable economic conditions and downturn in the housing market have resulted in significant tightening of credit markets which has limited the ability of consumers to access financing for new swimming pool and irrigation systems if these trends continue or worsen many consumers will likely not be able to obtain financing for pool and irrigation projects which could negatively impact our sales of construction related products 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to the success of our business we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool supply chain and landscape supply chain by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool systems inc which accounted for approximately 15 10 and 9 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2008 a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retail customers and other endusers of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single significant supplier due to financial failure or a decision to sell exclusively to other distributors retail customers or end user consumers could also adversely affect our business we dedicate significant resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe greatly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers and large pool or landscape supply retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our four largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 55 of our net sales in 2008 also tend to be more competitive than others 

  

  

more aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

 

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for direct and enduse customers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

we have experienced substantial sales growth through acquisitions market share gains and new sales center openings that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution during the past five fiscal years we have opened 31 new sales centers net of subsequent closings and consolidations of new sales centers and have completed 9 acquisitions these acquisitions have added 69 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations within one year of acquisition and three centralized shipping locations to our distribution networks in 2007 and 2008 we also closed 6 existing sales centers while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

the growth of our business depends on effective marketing programs 

the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base thus an important part of our strategy is to promote the growth of the pool industry through our extensive advertising and promotional programs that attempt to raise consumer awareness regarding the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns we believe these programs benefit the entire supply chain from our suppliers to our customers 

we also promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our programs include such features as personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training we also provide certain retail store customers with assistance in site selection store layout and design and business management system implementation our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising marketing and promotional programs to succeed in a weakened economic environment and an increasingly competitive marketplace in which we and our entire supply chain also compete with other luxury product alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2008 approximately 67 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year which represent the peak months of swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 20 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

we source certain products we sell including our private label products from asia and other international sources there is a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner and we may also be subject to certain trade restrictions that prevent us from obtaining products fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs currency exchange rates transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

  

  

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or longterm in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporate offices which consist of approximately 50000 square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50 ownership interest we own three sales center facilities in florida and one in texas we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three to seven year terms as of december 31 2008 we had seven leases that expire between 2018 and 2027 most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000 square feet to 100000 square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls and construction materials centers range in size from 16000 square feet to 132000 square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market under performing or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2008 financial overview 

financial results 

in these challenging times we have focused on business improvement opportunities maintaining tight control over costs and strengthening our commitment to programs and initiatives that will provide longterm value to customers suppliers and shareholders our 2008 results demonstrate our progress towards achieving these objectives as evidenced by our gross margin expansion our improved cost structure and increased cash provided by operations compared to 2007 

net sales decreased 8 as our sales remained pressured by the unprecedented adverse market and economic conditions impacting our industry base business sales declined 9 year over year due to soft demand for new pool and irrigation construction products and unfavorable weather this decrease was partially offset by sales from acquired businesses primarily our march 2008 acquisition of national pool tile group inc npt we also realized a modest increase in maintenance repair and replacement mrr product sales however sales of certain mrr products have declined as more consumers choose to defer discretionary replacement and refurbish activity complementary product sales which are heavily weighted towards new pool construction decreased approximately 15 compared to a 3 decrease in the same period in 2007 

for a discussion of our base business calculation see the results of operations section below 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin improved 140 basis points to 289 in 2008 from 275 in 2007 the increase in 2008 gross margin is primarily attributable to improved pricing management an increase in the sales of preferred vendor and pool corporation private label products and a favorable shift in product mix 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses for 2008 increased 1 compared to 2007 due to operating expenses related to acquired businesses base business operating expenses decreased 3 year over year due primarily to the impact from continued cost control initiatives and lower incentive compensation 

operating income decreased 14 to 1155 million in 2008 while operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin was down slightly to 64 in 2008 compared to 69 in 2007 interest expense decreased 32 million or 15 due primarily to a lower weighted average effective interest rate compared to 2007 

earnings per share for 2008 was 118 per diluted share on net income of 570 million compared to 137 per diluted share on net income of 694 million in 2007 included in 2008 earnings per share is the adverse impact of a loss of 004 per diluted share from our equity interest investment in latham acquisition corporation lac by comparison this investment contributed income of 002 per diluted share in 2007 our first quarter 2008 acquisitions had a dilutive impact of 002 per diluted share in 2008 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations increased 216 million to 933 million in 2008 due primarily to the favorable impact from the decrease in accounts receivable balances our 2008 cash provided by operations reflects a negative impact of approximately 360 million related to the net purchase and payment of inventory purchased ahead of vendor price increases which was largely offset by the benefit related to the deferral of our 300 million total third and fourth quarter 2008 estimated federal tax payments cash provided by operations helped fund the following in 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total net receivables decreased 18 to 1156 million at december 31 2008 from 1411 million at december 31 2007 due to the lower sales lower vendor receivables an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and a shift toward more cash sales as a result of tighter credit terms our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was 137 million at december 31 2008 an increase of 38 million over december 31 2007 we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts in the second half of 2008 to reflect an increase in our total past due receivable balances year over year days sales outstanding dso remained steady at 363 days at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 

our inventory levels increased 7 to 4059 million as of december 31 2008 compared to 3797 million as of december 31 2007 this increase reflects approximately 171 million of acquired inventory primarily related to npt and higher inventory levels attributable to the slowdown in sales and opportunistic buying in advance of vendor price increases our inventory turns as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis slowed to 31 times as of december 31 2008 compared to 37 times as of december 31 2007 

total debt outstanding decreased to 3278 million at december 31 2008 compared to 3509 million at december 31 2007 our current ratio increased to 21 as of december 31 2008 compared to 18 as of december 31 2007 

current trends 

continuing adverse economic trends have significantly impacted our industry these trends include a slowdown in the domestic housing market with lower housing turnover a sharp drop in new home construction home value deflation in many markets and a significant tightening of consumer and commercial credit some of the factors that help mitigate the impact of these trends on our business include the following 

 

 

despite these mitigating factors these negative trends have significantly impacted a number of our key markets including california florida and arizona with a modest and more recent adverse impact in texas we estimate that these trends resulted in the following decreases in new pool construction between 2005 and 2008 

 

 

 

we believe these decreases represent the first three year decline in new pool construction in our industry history since these trends worsened throughout 2007 and 2008 they had a more pronounced impact on our results for the year ended 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 given the current economic conditions we believe these trends could continue into 2009 this may result in an even greater impact on new pool construction and consumer spending on outdoor living spaces which could negatively impact our sales and earnings 

  

  

outlook 

building on the progress we have made our 2009 objectives remain focused on strengthening our market leading positions further improving our gross margin and expanding our cost improvement initiatives we will also focus on rebalancing our inventories following the opportunistic inventory purchases that we made in the second half of 2008 

we believe that the ongoing housing market and general economic downturns will continue to pressure new pool and irrigation construction activity however we expect a relatively stable maintenance market based on the increased installed based of swimming pools based on lower projected customer early buy purchases compared to the first quarter of 2008 we expect to see some shift of sales from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2009 

we anticipate mid to high single digit inflationary product cost increases that we expect to pass through the supply chain given the ongoing difficult external environment we will continue to focus on striking an appropriate balance on the extension of credit and maintaining a prudent cost structure we expect labor costs to decrease slightly compared to 2008 based on cost savings related to our recent headcount reductions and the fact that we have frozen salaries across the board in 2009 similar to 2008 we expect to realize equity losses from our investment in lac in 2009 as their business faces sales pressures on their pool construction products excluding any acquisition activity we do not expect to increase the number of sales centers in 2009 given the challenges in the external environment we will not provide any earnings per share guidance until we gain more visibility for how our 2009 results are tracking 

we expect to generate sufficient cash flow and have adequate access to capital to both fund our business objectives and our other priorities for the use of cash 

the forwardlooking statements in this outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including changes in the economy and the housing market the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographic location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from 01 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

 

 

 

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than 20000 additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote such writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 02 of net sales annually in 2008 writeoffs were 03 of net sales reflecting a trend related to the negative impacts on some of our customer’s businesses due to the difficult external environment 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2008 pretax income would change by approximately 27 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 003 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2008 

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity sales centers classify products into 13 classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months all inventory is included in these classes except for nonstock special order items and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 

 

there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage on a companywide basis 

  

  

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2008 pretax income would change by approximately 17 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 002 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2008 

vendor incentives 

we account for vendor incentives in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue 0216 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor incentives as if they are a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of cumulative purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for cumulative purchases and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our gross margins for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2008 and in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  united states taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

 

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions 

 

 

we have operations in 38 states and 7 foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include differences between the estimated deferred tax liability that we have recorded for equity earnings in unconsolidated investments and the actual taxes paid upon the return of undistributed equity earnings through a manner other than a capital transaction as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions we adopted fin 48 effective january 1 2007 as required we recorded the cumulative impact of adopting fin 48 in retained earnings we anticipate that the accounting under the provisions of fin 48 may provide for greater volatility in our effective tax rate as items are derecognized or as we record changes in measurement in interim periods 

incentive compensation accrual 

we have an incentive compensation structure designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses as a percentage of salaries based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year 

management sets the objectives for our bonus plans at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record an incentive compensation accrual at the end of each month using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved towards the stated bonus plan objectives during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans our estimated quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following 

 

 

 

impairment of goodwill and equity method investments 

goodwill 

our largest intangible asset is goodwill at december 31 2008 our goodwill balance was 1696 million representing 20 of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  under these rules we test goodwill for impairment annually or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units has fallen below their carrying value we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units’ goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units’ goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income since our operating segment is defined as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level our reporting unit is an individual sales center 

 

 

 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing fair value models which require us to make several assumptions about projected future cash flows discount rates and multiples in order to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value calculations we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on a detailed evaluation of recent historical operating trends current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate if our assumptions or estimates change we could incur impairment charges in future periods which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet for example a change in the estimated discount rate of 1 could have resulted in the fair value of our united kingdom reporting unit falling below its carrying value our united kingdom reporting unit had a goodwill balance of 71 million at december 31 2008 we have 198 other reporting units with goodwill balances for these reporting units the highest goodwill balance is 57 million and the average goodwill balance is 08 million 

in october 2008 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as a result of this test we determined that the goodwill attributed to one of our ohio sales centers was impaired based on the current and projected economic conditions in this market and fixed cost obligations related to an unfavorable longterm lease for this sales center facility we determined that the estimated fair value for this reporting unit was less than its carrying value as a result we performed additional impairment testing to determine the implied fair value of this reporting unit’s goodwill since the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value we wroteoff the 04 million goodwill balance related to this reporting unit this impairment expense is recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income based on our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the goodwill attributed to our other reporting units is not impaired 

 

equity method investments 

 

we have two equity method investments consisting of our 38 investment in latham acquisition corporation lac and our 50 investment in northpark corporate center we account for these investments in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion 18 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  the carrying value of our investments at december 31 2008 was 312 million including 301 million for lac 

 

we evaluate our equity method investments for potential impairment indicators on an ongoing basis this evaluation requires the exercise of judgment based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each investment a series of actual operating losses or projected future losses of an investee or other factors may indicate a decrease in value of the investment if impairment indicators exist we will evaluate whether the impairment is otherthantemporary impairment is measured by comparing the investment carrying amount to the estimated fair value of the investment 

 

based on the fact that lac’s results have deteriorated due to the current external market conditions including a net loss in 2008 and our expectations for a continued difficult environment in 2009 we considered other relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether there is an indicator of a decrease in the value of our investment as of december 31 2008 and if so whether it reflects an otherthantemporary impairment in evaluating the value of our investment in lac we considered the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using the criteria listed above we determined that there was no impairment of our equity method investments as of december 31 2008 if there are changes in lac’s financial projections or the factors we consider in performing our evaluations there could be indicators of a potential decrease in the value of our investments that may result in otherthantemporary impairments

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

note due to rounding percentages may not add to operating income or income before income taxes and equity earnings loss 

 

our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2008 2007 and 2006 we accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 

 

we exclude the following sales centers from base business results for a period of 15 months parenthetical numbers for each category indicate the number of sales centers excluded as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales after 15 months of operations we include acquired consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

in addition to the 22 sales centers excluded from base business as of december 31 2008 there were two sales centers opened in new markets that were excluded from january to may 2008 before they became base business sales centers in june 2008 since we divested our pool liner manufacturing operation in france in april 2008 we have also excluded these operations from base business for the comparative nine month period ended december 31 2007 

we have excluded the following acquisitions from base business for the periods identified

net sales 

 

the new pool and irrigation construction markets are facing unprecedented adverse conditions created by the combination of significant declines in the real estate and mortgagebacked financing markets as a result our 2008 sales were negatively impacted with a more profound effect on pool and irrigation construction product sales the decrease in net sales was more pronounced in our seasonally slow fourth quarter declining 14 compared to the same period in 2007 as the economy worsened and consumers began to defer more discretionary repair and replacement purchases 

base business sales decreased 9 compared to 2007 including an 8 decline on the swimming pool side of the business and 18 on the irrigation side of the business this impact remains more concentrated in markets that had the greatest runup in real estate values between 2000 and 2006 which includes a number of our larger markets in florida arizona and parts of california the decline in new pool construction negatively impacted complementary product sales which decreased 15 compared to 2007 overall weather conditions were unfavorable compared to the same period in 2007 see discussion of significant weather impacts under the heading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations beginning on page 31 

 

the overall decrease in net sales was partially offset by increases due to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

our sales growth for mrr products was primarily due to the following

despite the tough competitive pricing environment gross margin increased 140 basis points compared to 2007   the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to our focus on pricing discipline at the sales center level other favorable impacts compared to 2007 included the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

 

 

 

 

operating expenses 

 

the increase in operating expenses is due to approximately 145 million of operating expenses related to our 2008 acquisitions which was partially offset by a 3 decrease in base business operating expenses compared to 2007 the impact of cost control initiatives offset higher building rental expenses of 26 million primarily for sales centers opened or expanded during 2007 an increase in bad debt expense of 22 million higher product delivery costs and inflationary increases in wages and other costs total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased between periods due to the decrease in net sales 

our cost control initiatives include tighter management of discretionary costs the consolidation or closing of nine sales centers since november 2007 and selective personnel reductions over the past year despite the 6 reduction in headcount year over year excluding acquisitions we still reduced overtime and temporary labor costs by 45 million compared to 2007 incentive expenses declined 38 million and employee insurance costs also decreased due primarily to lower claims expense 

 

 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 15 between periods as the impact of a decrease in our weighted average effective interest rate for the period more than offset our higher average debt outstanding balance average debt outstanding was 3 higher for the year ended 2008 reflecting our increased borrowings during the first half of 2008 that funded our march 2008 acquisitions the weighted average effective interest rate decreased to 48 in 2008 from 60 in 2007 

income taxes 

the decrease in income taxes is due to the decrease in income before income taxes and equity earnings loss our effective income tax rate was 3926 at december 31 2008 and 3866 at december 31 2007 the increase in the effective income tax rate reflects a valuation allowance established for annual losses from certain foreign operations 

net income and earnings per share 

net income decreased 18 to 570 million in 2008 earnings per share for 2008 decreased to 118 per diluted share compared to 137 in 2007 the dilutive impact of our first quarter acquisitions was approximately 002 per diluted share for 2008 in both periods earnings per share benefited from the reduction of our weighted average shares outstanding due to the impact of our 2007 share repurchase activities this included an accretive impact of approximately 002 in 2008 and 001 in 2007 

fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the excluded components sales centers excluded from base business 

 

for an explanation of how we calculate base business please refer to the discussion of base business beginning on page 24 under the heading “fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007” 

  

  

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2007 to the year ended december 31 2006 we have excluded 15 acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below and an average of four sales centers opened in new markets of which two are still excluded from base business as of year end due to the timing of the two sales centers closed during the fourth quarter of 2007 these locations have not been excluded for the purpose of calculating base business for all periods presented the three sales centers consolidated with existing sales centers during the fourth quarter of 2007 will remain part of the base business since we expect to transfer the majority of the existing business to our nearby locations 

 

the table below summarizes the changes in our sales centers during 2007 

 

 

for information about our 2007 and 2006 acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 

 

the increase in net sales is primarily a result of the wickham acquisition and sales from new locations that we opened in new markets base business sales decreased 1 compared to 2006 as sales declines for products used in new pool and irrigation construction were not fully offset by the sales growth for mrr products and our international operations 

demand for pool and irrigation construction products was impacted by the weak housing market tightening credit markets and unfavorable weather conditions new pool construction permits declined significantly throughout 2007 especially in our key florida arizona and california markets net sales were also adversely impacted by the competitive pricing pressures experienced in the difficult market environment 

our sales growth for mrr products was primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

complementary product sales decreased 3 year over year compared to a 26 increase from 2005 to 2006 our complementary product sales were adversely impacted by the declines in new construction activity but benefited from our expansion of complementary product offerings and an increase in the number of sales centers that now offer complementary products 

gross profit 

 

gross margin decreased 80 basis points compared to 2006 including a consistent decline in base business gross margin 

our 2007 gross margin is comparatively lower primarily due to the following impacts listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

 

 

operating expenses 

 

total operating expenses grew 7 and increased 110 basis points as a percentage of net sales compared to 2006 while base business operating expenses were 4 higher and increased 100 basis points as a percentage of net sales these increases reflect the following listed in order of estimated magnitude 

 

 

 

 

 

these increased costs were partially offset by lower incentive expenses and the impact from cost control initiatives 

we opened 12 new sales centers in 2007 compared to 17 new sales centers in 2006 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 70 million between periods as average debt outstanding was 41 higher in 2007 compared to 2006 the higher debt levels in 2007 reflect increased borrowings to fund share repurchases the weighted average effective interest rate also increased to 60 in 2007 from 58 in 2006 

income taxes 

income taxes decreased to 432 million in 2007 from 588 million in 2006 due to the 406 million decrease in income before income taxes and equity earnings our effective income tax rate was 3866 at december 31 2007 and 3861 at december 31 2006 

 

 

net income and earnings per share 

net income decreased to 694 million in 2007 from 950 million in 2006 our equity interest in lac produced 09 million of net earnings in 2007 compared to 16 million in 2006 earnings per share for 2007 decreased to 137 per diluted share compared to 174 in 2006 the decrease includes the impact of approximately 016 per diluted share related to the incremental operating expenses for new sales centers opened since january 2006 by comparison the impact of incremental operating expenses for new sales centers opened in 2006 was approximately 006 per diluted share in 2006 in both 2007 and 2006 earnings per share benefited from the reduction of our weighted average shares outstanding due to the impact of our share repurchase activities 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2008 approximately 67 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2008 and 2007 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of the swimming pool industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 

 

 

  note due to rounding the sum of quarterly percentage amounts may not equal 100 

we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers based on our peak summer selling season we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers when warranted either in the first quarter before the peak selling season starts or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends 

 

 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 

 

in the first half of 2008 our sales benefited from more favorable weather in texas and oklahoma compared to the same period in 2007 see discussion below however our sales were negatively impacted in 2008 by generally unfavorable weather conditions including cooler temperatures and higher precipitation nationally compared to 2007 the start of the 2008 pool season was delayed even further than in 2007 due to several late winter storms in the midwest and northeast and much cooler march temperatures across most of the country cooler than normal temperatures in august and september also shortened the pool season in 2008 for most north american markets excluding the west coast while a number of severe tropical systems adversely impacted our sales in texas florida and louisiana during the third quarter of 2008 

in 2007 our sales were negatively impacted by extended winter conditions that delayed the start of the pool season in the northeast compared to 2006 much cooler and unusually wet weather conditions in texas and oklahoma during the first seven months of 2007 which had a significant impact on sales related to pool and landscape construction and less than ideal conditions in the third quarter which compared unfavorably to the same period in 2006 

in 2006 our sales benefited from near record high temperatures across much of north america this favorable impact was more pronounced in the first quarter of 2006 especially in our northern markets which experienced an earlier start to the pool season compared to 2005 while maintenance and impulse sales benefited from the near record high temperatures sales tied to pool construction and pool usage were hindered by above average precipitation in the northeast and northwest despite 2006 being the hottest year on record nationally sales were negatively impacted by much colder than average august and september temperatures which shortened the pool season in certain markets 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which combined with seller financing have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures 

we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business returning money to our shareholders and maintaining a prudent debt structure our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

 

 

 

while we still have our board authorized share repurchase program in place with 530 million of the current authorized amount remaining available as of december 31 2008 this is not a current priority for the use of cash 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 

 

cash flow provided by operations increased 216 million compared to 2007 due primarily to the favorable impact from the reduction in outstanding accounts receivable our 2008 cash provided by operating activities also reflects the benefit related to our 300 million deferred third and fourth quarter 2008 estimated federal tax payments as allowed by the internal revenue service irs for taxpayers affected by hurricane gustav this benefit was offset by a negative impact of approximately 360 million related to the net purchase and payment of inventory purchased ahead of vendor price increases in 2008 the increase in cash used in investing activities reflects cash paid for our march 2008 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures cash used in financing activities in 2008 includes 231 million of net payments on debt 

our 2007 cash provided by operations increased 26 million compared to 2006 due primarily to favorable impacts from changes in working capital balances which offset the decrease in net income the working capital impact is reflected in the net change in our receivable and accounts payable balances between periods but this benefit to our 2007 cash provided by operations was largely offset by the increase in inventory the change from a use of cash in 2006 to a source of cash in 2007 from other accrued liabilities is due to the payment in 2006 of 270 million in estimated federal tax payments that we deferred from 2005 as allowed by the irs 

 

 

cash used in investing activities decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to the reduced level of acquisition activity our financing activities for the year included 985 million of net proceeds from debt and cash related to our stock plans offset by 1397 million of total share repurchases and 227 million for the payment of our quarterly cash dividends to shareholders which we increased in the second quarter of 2007 

future sources and uses of cash 

as amended on december 20 2007 our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility provides for 3000 million in borrowing capacity including a 2400 million fiveyear revolving credit facility the revolver and a 600 million term loan the term loan the term loan matures on december 20 2010 and the revolver matures on december 20 2012 the credit facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the revolver may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to 750 million to a total of 3150 million 

at december 31 2008 there was 1530 million outstanding and 863 million available for borrowing under the revolver the weighted average effective interest rate on the revolver was approximately 42 for the year ended december 31 2008 

at december 31 2008 there was 540 million outstanding under the term loan of which 60 million is classified as current in march 2008 we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates for the remaining outstanding period of the term loan the swap agreement converts the term loan’s variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 24 on the initial notional amount of 540 million which will decrease as payments are made on the term loan until maturity on december 31 2010 the swap agreement has an effective date of december 31 2008 

in may 2008 we renewed our accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility for one year through may 2009 effective september 2008 the receivables facility provided a borrowing capacity of up to 950 million which was reduced to 75 million in january 2009 for a discussion of amendments we made to the receivables facility in january 2009 see note 14 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

the receivables facility provides for the true sale of certain of our receivables as they are created to a wholly owned bankruptcyremote subsidiary this subsidiary grants an undivided security interest in the receivables to an unrelated commercial paper conduit because of the structure of the bankruptcyremote subsidiary and our ability to control its activities we include the transferred receivables and related debt in our consolidated balance sheets we continue to employ this arrangement because it provides us with additional borrowing capacity and flexibility at december 31 2008 there was 208 million outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 38 we intend to renew the receivables facility in the second quarter of 2009 with comparable or similar terms as those contained in the facility as amended on january 15 2009 

on february 12 2007 we issued and sold 1000 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes the notes in a private placement offering pursuant to a note purchase agreement the notes are due february 12 2012 and accrue interest on the unpaid principal balance at a floating rate equal to a spread of 0600 over the threemonth libor as adjusted from time to time we used the net proceeds from the placement to pay down borrowings under the credit facility in february 2007 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the notes the swap agreement converts the notes’ variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 5088 on the initial notional amount of 1000 million which will decrease to a notional amount of 500 million in 2010 

as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements related to our credit facility our notes and our receivables facility for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

 

in the first quarter of 2009 our cash flows will be negatively impacted by the payment of our 300 million third and fourth quarter 2008 estimated federal tax payments in january 2009 as discussed above in the sources and uses of cash section we deferred these payments as allowed by the irs 

as of february 20 2009 530 million of the current board authorized amount under our share repurchase program remained available while share repurchases are not a current priority we may continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we may use cash flows from operations to fund these purchases or we may incur additional debt 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions additionally we may issue common or preferred stock to raise funds 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2008 our contractual obligations for longterm debt shortterm financing and operating leases were as follows in thousands 

 

for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k the table below contains estimated interest payments related to our longterm debt and shortterm financing obligations listed in the table above our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31 2008 outstanding balances of each of our debt instruments and the related effective interest rates for the year ended december 31 2008 on our term loan and our notes the variable rates are converted to fixed rates under our existing swap agreements  to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on information currently available related to scheduled payments and maturities of these debt instruments 

 

 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan and our notes 

 

 

if i the variable rates on our revolver and our receivables facility increased or decreased 10 from the rate at december 31 2008 and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available as of december 31 2008 under the revolver 3150 million assuming that at our request and with agreement by the lenders we exercised the 750 million accordion feature and the receivables facility 950 million for all of 2008 then our pretax income would decrease by approximately 41 million and earnings per share would decrease by 005 per diluted share based on the number of weighed average diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2008 

failure of our swap counterparty would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements in this case we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements additionally failure of our swap counterparty would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

currency risk 

we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom france italy portugal spain and mexico in the past we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues operating expenses and earnings due to the relative small size of our international operations however we do not anticipate that exposure to currency rate fluctuations will be material in 2009

 item 1 business 

general 

based on industry data pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as pool we us or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 under the name scp holding corporation and in 1995 changed its name to scp pool corporation in 2006 the company changed its name to pool corporation this change acknowledges the company’s growth from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products and offering a range of services to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2007 we operated 281 sales centers in north america and europe 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 70 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 12 own a pool higher rates of new home construction from 1996 to 2005 have added to the market expansion opportunity for pool ownership particularly in larger pool markets 

we believe the longterm prospects of our industry are positively impacted by favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends this includes the expected continued longterm growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration towards the south and the need to maintain the growing installed base of pools the industry has also been positively impacted by the trend for increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment additionally consumers frequently bundle the purchase of a pool with other products as part of a complete backyard makeover new irrigation systems and landscaping are often key components to completing a swimming pool installation or remodel the irrigation and landscape market has many characteristics in common with the pool industry and we believe that it benefits from the same favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends and will realize growth rates similar to the pool industry 

the majority of consumer spending in our industry is derived from the nondiscretionary maintenance of existing swimming pools including the repair and replacement of the equipment for those pools we believe that the recurring nature of the repair and replacement market has helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth historically even in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and negative trends in the housing market adversely impact pool construction activities 

new swimming pool construction and irrigation starts comprise the bulk of the remaining consumer spending in our industry the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations 

general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp and certain trends in the housing market affect our industry particularly new pool and irrigation system starts positive gdp trends may have a favorable impact on industry starts while negative trends may be unfavorable for industry starts we believe there may be some correlation between industry starts and the rate of housing turnover and home appreciation over time with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on starts over time 

 

in 2007 the sharp drop in new home construction home value deflation in many markets the tightening of credit and negative trends in consumer confidence had a negative impact on the industry and our performance since less than 40 of our sales are tied to new pool or irrigation construction and we estimate that only 10 to 20 of new pools are constructed along with new home construction we do not expect any cyclicality in new housing starts in itself to have a significant longterm impact on our business our expectation is that the swimming pool industry will return to an annual growth rate of approximately 2  to 6 when the real estate and credit markets revert to normal 

our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affects our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september unseasonable warming or cooling trends can delay or accelerate the start or end of the pool and landscape season impacting our maintenance and repair sales these impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent above average precipitation late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities 

the industry is also affected by other factors including but not limited to consumer attitudes toward pool and landscape products for environmental or safety reasons 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are to promote the growth of our industry to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and to continuously strive to operate more effectively 

we promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with everything from site selection to store layout and design to business management system implementation 

we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we have increased our product breadth as described in the “customers and products” section below we have also expanded our sales center network through acquisitions which have been an important source of sales growth new sales center openings and expansions of existing sales centers since 2003 we have opened 39 new sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations and successfully completed 11 acquisitions consisting of 64 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations 

based upon industry data we believe the industry grew at a 2 to 6 annual rate for the period between 2000 and 2005 but declined in 2006 and 2007 historically our growth has exceeded the industry’s rates and allowed us to increase market share we expect our sales growth to be higher than the industry average due to increases in market share and expansion of our product offerings 

for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 and note 14 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k we intend to pursue additional strategic acquisitions which will allow us to further penetrate existing markets and expand into new geographic markets and product categories 

 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 70000 customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve five types of customers 

 

 

 

 

 

the majority of these customers are small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources 

we conduct our operations through 281 sales centers in north america and europe our primary markets which have the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 54 of our net sales in 2007 we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from the sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 100000 national brand and private label products we believe that our selection of pool equipment supplies chemicals replacement parts irrigation and landscape products and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintenance products and repair and replacement parts are nondiscretionary in nature meaning that these items must be purchased by endusers to maintain existing swimming pools and landscaped areas over 60 of our gross profits are derived from the sale of products used to maintain and repair these existing features and less than 40 are derived from the construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of new pools and landscaping we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon distributors horizon network which we acquired through acquisitions in 2005 and 2006 

our complementary product sales accounted for over 9 of our total net sales in 2007 at comparable margins to our traditional product offerings while complementary product sales decreased 3 in 2007 due primarily to the downturn in new pool and irrigation construction complementary product sales have been an important factor in our base business sales growth over the past eight years having grown from approximately 30 million in 1999 to over 1800 million in 2007 

we have identified other product categories that could become part of our complementary product offerings in the future we typically introduce two to three categories each year in certain markets we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those which we believe exhibit longterm growth potential in 2008 we intend to continue to expand our complementary products initiative by increasing the number of locations which offer complementary products increasing the number of complementary products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of the product offerings on a companywide basis 

 

operating strategy 

we operate three distribution networks the scp distributors scp network the superior pool products superior network and the horizon network the scp network consists of 157 sales centers including 11 locations in europe the superior network consists of 62 locations and the horizon network also consists of 62 locations 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products through our scp and superior networks and we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services including customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

in addition we operate five centralized shipping locations and four standalone construction materials centers that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or directly to customers 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms are typically available to us for preseason or early season purchases 

we initiated a preferred vendor program in 1999 which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors we work closely with these vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and concentrate our purchasing activities these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have resulted in improved margins at the sales center level 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool care inc which accounted for approximately 15 11 and 9 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2007 

  

  

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of landscape and irrigation products in the united states and we compete against one national wholesale distributor of these products we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal distribution networks 

some geographic markets we serve particularly our largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona are more competitive than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brandname products if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights we might be materially and adversely affected we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 

we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3500 people at december 31 2007 given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer when we add approximately 500 more employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand

 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

 

  

  

 

risk factors 

 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements include the following 

 

the demand for our swimming pool and related outdoor lifestyle products may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the growth rate of pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools account for more than 60 of our gross profits the growth of this portion of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base and could also be adversely affected by decreases in construction activities similar to the trends in 2007 in addition even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance such downturns expose us to certain additional risks including but not limited to the risk of customer closures or bankruptcies which could shrink our potential customer base and inhibit our ability to collect on those customers’ receivables 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can shorten the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to the success of our business we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool supply chain and landscape supply chain by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and zodiac pool care inc which accounted for approximately 15 11 and 9 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2007 a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retail customers and other endusers of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single supplier could also adversely affect our business we dedicate significant resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe greatly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers and large pool or landscape supply retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 54 of our net sales in 2007 also tend to be more competitive than others 

more aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

 

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for direct and enduse customers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

specifically our future success depends to an extent upon the continued service of manuel perez de la mesa our president and chief executive officer the loss of mr perez de la mesa in particular could have a material adverse effect on our business mr perez de la mesa is not nearing retirement age and we have no indication that he intends to retire in the near future we do not currently maintain key man insurance on mr perez de la mesa 

past growth may not be indicative of future growth 

we have experienced substantial sales growth through acquisitions and new sales center openings that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution during the past five fiscal years we have opened 39 new sales centers and have completed 11 acquisitions these acquisitions have added 64 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations and a centralized shipping location to our distribution networks while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

the growth of our business depends on effective marketing programs 

the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base thus an important part of our strategy is to promote the growth of the pool industry through our extensive advertising and promotional programs that attempt to raise consumer awareness regarding the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns we believe these programs benefit the entire supply chain from our suppliers to our customers 

we also promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our programs include such things as personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training we also provide certain retail store customers with assistance in site selection store layout and design and business management system implementation our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising marketing and promotional programs to succeed in a weakened economic environment and an increasingly competitive marketplace in which we and our entire supply chain also compete with other luxury product alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

  

  

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2007 approximately 65 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year which represent the peak months of swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 20 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in higher operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

we source certain products we sell including our private label products from asia and other international sources there is a greater risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner and we may also be subject to certain trade restrictions that prevent us from obtaining products fluctuations in other factors relating to international trade such as tariffs currency exchange rates transportation costs and inflation are additional risks for our international operations 

 

  

  

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

discretionary spending on leisure product offerings such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic or political uncertainty the potential for terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility could create these types of uncertainties and negatively impact our business for the short or longterm in ways that cannot presently be predicted

 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporate offices which consist of approximately 50000 square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50 ownership interest we own three sales centers in florida and one sales center in texas we lease all of our other properties and the majority of our leases have three to seven year terms as of december 31 2007 we had seven leases that expire between 2018 and 2027 most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000 square feet to 100000 square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations csls and construction materials centers range in size from 16000 square feet to 132000 square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market under performing or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2007 financial overview 

financial results 

our 2007 financial results were negatively impacted by a difficult combination of external conditions particularly the depressed housing and real estate markets which intensified throughout 2007 falling home values across much of the country and tightening credit markets created a significant drop in new construction activities unfavorable weather conditions also had an adverse impact during the first half of 2007 both on sales of construction products and on maintenance and repair products extended winter conditions delayed the start of the pool season in the central and northeast regions record wet weather in texas and oklahoma caused decreases across customer types greatly hindering construction and installation activities and affecting replacement and repair activities considering the magnitude of these unfavorable external trends we believe our sales performance compares favorably to 2006 and indicates our success in gaining market share and improving our competitive position 

base business sales decreased 1 in 2007 as the significant decline in new pool construction permits negatively impacted demand for new pool and irrigation products this impact was more pronounced in some of our larger markets most notably in florida these sales decreases were partially offset by moderate sales growth for maintenance repair and replacement products which comprises the majority of our sales and includes chemicals and parts products complementary product sales which are sold primarily in the new pool construction market decreased 3 compared to 2006 

for a discussion of our base business calculation see the results of operations section below 

our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 275 in 2007 compared to 2006 this decrease reflects the impact of competitive pricing pressures resulting from the current market environment and unfavorable comparisons to 2006 gross margin in 2006 our gross margin improved by 40 basis points over 2005 due to benefits from our supply chain management initiatives including preprice increase purchases in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2006 

selling and administrative expenses operating expenses increased 7 compared to 2006 this increase includes the addition of expenses from the wickham acquisition in august 2006 investments in 29 new sales centers opened since the beginning of 2006 an increase in bad debt expense higher expenses related to existing sales center expansions and relocations and higher freight costs these higher expenses were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and the impact of cost control initiatives 

our operating income decreased 20 to 1338 million in 2007 while operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin decreased to 69 from 88 in 2006 interest expense increased 46 for 2007 due to higher debt levels for borrowings to fund share repurchases and a higher average effective interest rate compared to the same period in 2006 net income decreased 27 to 694 million compared to 2006 and included 09 million of net equity earnings from our investment in latham acquisition corporation lac 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations increased 26 million to 716 million in 2007 due primarily to favorable impacts from changes in working capital balances which offset the decrease in net income 

coupled with net proceeds from other financing activities of approximately 985 million cash provided by operations helped fund the following in 2007 

 

 

 

 

 

our accounts receivable balance decreased 9 to 1411 million at december 31 2007 days sales outstanding dso increased between periods to 363 days at december 31 2007 compared to 350 days at december 31 2006 our allowance for doubtful accounts increased to 99 million at december 31 2007 from 49 million at december 31 2006 this increase reflects slower payments from customers in markets that have been adversely impacted by the decline in new pool and irrigation construction 

our net inventory balance increased 476 million to 3797 million at december 31 2007 the increase reflects inventory for the 12 new sales centers opened in 2007 higher inventory levels attributable to the decline in fourth quarter sales and higher quantities of early buy inventory received in the fourth quarter of 2007 than in the fourth quarter of 2006 inventory turns as calculated on a trailing 12 month basis slowed to 37 times in 2007 from 39 times in 2006 

total debt outstanding increased to 3509 million at december 31 2007 compared to 2654 million at december 31 2006 this increase is attributable to increased borrowings to fund our 2007 share repurchases and slightly higher working capital levels we continue to maintain a healthy current ratio of 18 which was unchanged from december 31 2006 

current trends 

current economic trends include a slowdown in the domestic housing market with lower housing turnover a sharp drop in new home construction home value deflation in many markets decreases in shortterm interest rates and a tightening of consumer and commercial credit some of the factors that help mitigate the impact of these trends on our business include the following 

 

 

 

despite these mitigating factors these negative trends had a more pronounced impact during 2007 and have significantly impacted some of our key markets including florida arizona and parts of california we believe these trends along with the impact of unusually wet weather in texas and oklahoma and a delay in the start of pool construction in northern markets due to unfavorable weather conditions resulted in a decrease in new pool construction of approximately 50000 units or 25 in 2007 this followed a decrease of approximately 10000 units or 5 in 2006 representing the first back to back decrease in recent industry history a continuation or worsening of these trends may have an even greater impact on new pool construction and consumer spending on outdoor living spaces which could negatively impact our sales and earnings 

 

  

  

outlook 

our objectives in 2008 include 

 

 

we believe the prolonged downturn in real estate markets and restricted access to credit coupled with the uncertain general economic environment will continue to adversely impact new pool and irrigation construction given the challenges in the external environment we will not provide any earnings per share guidance until we gain more visibility for how our 2008 results are tracking 

we expect to generate sufficient cash flow and have adequate access to capital to both fund our business objectives and provide a direct return to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments 

our business is subject to significant risks including weather competition general economic conditions and other risks as detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we generally require payment from our customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographical location credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from 01 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

 

  

  

at the end of each quarter we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than 20000 additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote such writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged approximately 01 of net sales 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2007 pretax income would change by approximately 12 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 002 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2007 

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity sales centers classify products into 13 classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months all inventory is included in these classes except for nonstock special order items and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 

 

there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage on a companywide basis 

 

  

  

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

our reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2007 pretax income would change by approximately 07 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 001 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2007 

vendor incentives 

we account for vendor incentives in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue 0216 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for vendor incentives as if they are a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of cumulative purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for cumulative purchases and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased they may lower or raise our gross margins for products purchased and sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2007 and in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  united states taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

 

  

  

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions 

 

we have operations in 38 states and seven foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include differences between the estimated deferred tax liability that we have recorded for equity earnings in unconsolidated investments and the actual taxes paid upon the return of undistributed equity earnings through a manner other than a capital transaction as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions we adopted fin 48 effective january 1 2007 as required we recorded the cumulative impact of adopting fin 48 in retained earnings we anticipate that the accounting under the provisions of fin 48 may provide for greater volatility in our effective tax rate as items are derecognized or as we record changes in measurement in interim periods 

incentive compensation accrual 

we have an incentive compensation structure designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses as a percentage of salaries based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recent completed fiscal year 

the objectives for our bonus plans are set at the inception of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record an incentive compensation accrual at the end of each month using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved towards the stated bonus plan objectives during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific bonus plan objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans due to both the discretionary components of the bonus plans and the timing of the approval and payment of the annual bonuses our estimated quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts 

goodwill 

our largest intangible asset is goodwill at december 31 2007 our goodwill balance was 1552 million representing 19 of total assets goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  under these rules we test goodwill for impairment annually or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units has fallen below their carrying value we will compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units’ goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units’ goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

 

our goodwill impairment test requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a discounted cash flow approach which requires us to make several assumptions about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates if our assumptions or estimates change we could incur charges in future periods for goodwill impairment 

in october 2007 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined there was no impairment

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

our discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2007 2006 and 2005 we accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

 

  

  

fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the acquired and new market component sales centers excluded from base business 

 

we exclude the following sales centers from our base business results for a period of 15 months 

 

 

 

additionally we generally allocate overhead expenses to acquired and new market sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales 

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2007 to the year ended december 31 2006 we have excluded 15 acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below and an average of four sales centers opened in new markets of which two are still excluded from base business as of year end due to the timing of the two sales centers closed during the fourth quarter of 2007 these locations have not been excluded for the purpose of calculating base business for all periods presented the three sales centers consolidated with existing sales centers during the fourth quarter of 2007 will remain part of the base business since we expect to transfer the majority of the existing business to our nearby locations 

 

 

for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

  

  

net sales 

 

the increase in net sales is primarily a result of the wickham acquisition and sales from new locations that we opened in new markets base business sales decreased 1 compared to 2006 as sales declines for products used in new pool and irrigation construction were not fully offset by the solid sales growth for maintenance repair and replacement products and our international operations 

demand for pool and irrigation construction products was impacted by the weak housing market tightening credit markets and unfavorable weather conditions new pool construction permits declined significantly throughout 2007 especially in our key florida arizona and california markets net sales were also adversely impacted by the competitive pricing pressures experienced in the current market environment 

our sales growth for maintenance repair and replacement products was primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

complementary product sales decreased 3 year over year compared to a 26 increase from 2005 to 2006 our complementary product sales were adversely impacted by the declines in new construction activity but benefited from our expansion of complementary product offerings and an increase in the number of sales centers that now offer complementary products 

gross profit 

 

gross margin decreased 80 basis points compared to 2006 including a consistent decline in base business gross margin 

our 2007 gross margin is comparatively lower primarily due to the following impacts 

 

 

 

 

operating expenses 

 

 

total operating expenses grew 7 and increased 110 basis points as a percentage of net sales compared to 2006 while base business operating expenses were 4 higher and increased 100 basis points as a percentage of net sales these increases reflect the following 

 

 

 

 

 

these increased costs were partially offset by lower incentive expenses and the impact from cost control initiatives 

we opened 12 new sales centers in 2007 compared to 17 new sales centers in 2006 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 70 million between periods as average debt outstanding was 41 higher in 2007 compared to 2006 the higher debt levels in 2007 reflect increased borrowings to fund share repurchases the weighted average effective interest rate also increased to 60 in 2007 from 58 in 2006 

income taxes 

income taxes decreased to 432 million in 2007 from 588 million in 2006 due to the 406 million decrease in income before income taxes and equity earnings our effective income tax rate was 3866 at december 31 2007 and 3861 at december 31 2006 

net income and earnings per share 

net income decreased to 694 million in 2007 from 950 million in 2006 our equity interest in lac produced 09 million of net earnings in 2007 compared to 16 million in 2006 earnings per share for 2007 decreased to 137 per diluted share compared to 174 in 2006 the decrease includes the impact of approximately 016 per diluted share related to the incremental operating expenses for new sales centers opened since january 2006 by comparison the impact of incremental operating expenses for new sales centers opened in 2006 was approximately 006 per diluted share last year in both 2007 and 2006 earnings per share benefited from the reduction of our weighted average shares outstanding due to the impact of our share repurchase activities 

 

  

  

fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 

the following table breaks out our consolidated results into the base business component and the acquired and new market component sales centers excluded from base business 

 

please refer to the discussion of base business exclusions under the heading “ fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 ” above 

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2005 we have excluded 58 acquired sales centers from base business for the periods identified in the table below and an average of three sales centers opened in new markets all which remain excluded as of december 31 2006 

 

 

for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

  

  

net sales 

 

the increase in net sales is primarily a result of the horizon acquisitions and the growth in our base business 

base business sales growth was 10 in 2006 due primarily to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

new product initiatives continue to be focused on our complementary products category for which sales have grown from 30 million in 1999 to 1801 million in 2006 these products which our customers historically purchased from other suppliers carry gross margins comparable to our traditional product categories we no longer include horizon’s sales in our complementary product calculations 

gross profit 

 

base business gross profit growth of 12 contributed 487 million to the increase in 2006 while acquired sales centers accounted for most of the remaining increase 

gross margin increased 40 basis points in 2006 due primarily to the benefits achieved through our supply chain management initiatives including our preprice increase inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2005 and second quarter of 2006 we made aggressive early buy purchases during the fourth quarter of 2005 to take advantage of price discounts and to mitigate the impact of expected 2006 price increases and we made additional preprice increase purchases during the second quarter of 2006 that benefited our third quarter gross margins 

our gross margin improvement also includes slightly higher margin contribution from acquired businesses and a small favorable product mix shift in 2006 to higher margin products which is attributable to our successful sales initiatives including our expansion of parts and complementary product offerings the overall increase in gross margin was partially offset by lower earned vendor incentives as a percentage of total net sales in 2006 this decrease reflects a lower aggregate vendor incentive rate compared to 2005 and a slight decrease between years in our annual purchase volumes as a percentage of total net sales the decrease in rate is due to lower incentives as a percentage of total net sales for our acquired businesses and a shift in purchasing mix to products with lower incentives primarily complementary products 

 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses grew 25 and as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points in 2006 due primarily to higher expense ratios for our recently acquired businesses and startup costs and higher expense ratios for new sales centers opened in 2006 we opened 17 sales centers in 2006 compared to only three sales centers in 2005 the 17 new locations include 11 new pool sales centers and six new horizon sales centers expenses related to other investments in our business also contributed to the increase in operating expenses we moved 24 existing sales centers to bigger locations expanded another 16 existing sales center locations opened two new construction material distribution centers and also launched two new valueadded customer programs among other new company initiatives in 2006 these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower employee bonuses in 2006 of approximately 40 million 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 88 million between periods as average debt outstanding was 79 higher in 2006 compared to 2005 the higher debt levels in 2006 reflect increased borrowings to fund share repurchases acquisitions and higher working capital levels the weighted average effective interest rate also increased to 58 in 2006 from 43 in 2005 

income taxes 

income taxes increased to 588 million in 2006 from 499 million in 2005 due to the 233 million increase in income before income taxes and equity earnings our effective income tax rate was 3861 at december 31 2006 and 3874 at december 31 2005 as adjusted for the impact of sharebased compensation expense 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 18 to 950 million in 2006 from 805 million in 2005 net income in 2006 included 16 million of net equity earnings from our investment in lac diluted earnings per share increased 20 to 174 per share in 2006 from 145 per share in 2005 

 

  

  

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2007 approximately 65 of our net sales and over 100 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2007 and 2006 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of the swimming pool industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 

 

in the third and fourth quarters of 2006 and full year 2007 our results of operations include the 14 wickham sales centers that we acquired in august 2006 we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers we attempt to open new sales centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the following peak selling season 

 

  

  

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 

 

in 2007 our sales were negatively impacted by extended winter conditions that delayed the start of the pool season in the northeast compared to 2006 much cooler and unusually wet weather conditions in texas and oklahoma during the first seven months of 2007 which had a significant impact on sales related to pool and landscape construction and less than ideal conditions in the third quarter which compared unfavorably to the same period in 2006 

in 2006 our sales benefited from near record high temperatures across much of north america this favorable impact was more pronounced in the first quarter of 2006 especially in our northern markets which experienced an earlier start to the pool season compared to 2005 while maintenance and impulse sales benefited from the near record high temperatures sales tied to pool construction and pool usage were hindered by above average precipitation in the northeast and northwest despite 2006 being the hottest year on record nationally sales were negatively impacted by much colder than average august and september temperatures which shortened the pool season in certain markets 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet shortterm and longterm cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which combined with seller financing have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business returning money to our shareholders and maintaining a prudent debt structure our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 

 

our 2007 cash provided by operations increased 26 million compared to 2006 due primarily to favorable impacts from changes in working capital balances which offset the decrease in net income the working capital impact is reflected in the net change in our receivable and accounts payable balances between periods but this benefit to our 2007 cash provided by operations was largely offset by the increase in inventory the change from a use of cash in 2006 to a source of cash in 2007 from other accrued liabilities is due to the payment in 2006 of 270 million in estimated federal tax payments that we deferred from 2005 as allowed by the irs 

cash used in investing activities decreased due to the reduced level of acquisition activity in 2007 our financing activities for the year included 985 million of net proceeds from debt and cash related to our stock plans offset by 1397 million of total share repurchases and 227 million for the payment of our quarterly cash dividends to shareholders which we increased in the second quarter of 2007 

our 2006 cash provided by operations increased 296 million compared to 2005 due primarily to the increase in net income and the impact related to our fourth quarter 2005 early buy purchases in 2005 our cash provided by operations was negatively impacted by early buy inventory purchases that we received and paid for in the fourth quarter of 2005 this impact is reflected in the net change in our inventory and accounts payable balances between periods but the benefit to our 2006 cash provided by operations was largely offset by the decrease in accrued expenses which included a 270 million payment for estimated federal tax payments that were deferred from the second half of 2005 as allowed by the katrina emergency tax relief act of 2005 the remaining increase in cash provided by operations is attributable to the change in our accounts receivable balance between periods 

future sources and uses of cash 

as amended on december 20 2007 our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility now provides for 3000 million in borrowing capacity including a 2400 million fiveyear revolving credit facility the revolver and a 600 million term loan the term loan the term loan matures on december 20 2010 and the revolver matures on december 20 2012 the credit facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit pursuant to an accordion feature the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the revolver may be increased from time to time by up to 750 million to a total of 315 million 

at december 31 2007 there was 1255 million outstanding and 1140 million available for borrowing under the revolver the weighted average effective interest rate on the revolver was approximately 64 for the year ended december 31 2007 

at december 31 2007 there was 570 million outstanding under the term loan of which 30 million is classified as current in december 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the swap agreement converts our variable rate term loan to a fixedrate basis until its termination on december 31 2008 we have designated this swap as a cash flow hedge during the year ended december 31 2007 no gains or losses were recognized on this swap the weighted average effective interest rate of the term loan was approximately 57 for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

in march 2007 we renewed our accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility which provides a seasonal borrowing capacity of up to 1500 million through march 2008 the receivables facility provides for the true sale of certain of our receivables as they are created to a wholly owned bankruptcyremote subsidiary this subsidiary grants an undivided security interest in the receivables to an unrelated commercial paper conduit because of the structure of the bankruptcyremote subsidiary and our ability to control its activities we include the transferred receivables and related debt in our consolidated balance sheets we continue to employ this arrangement because it provides us with a lower cost form of financing at december 31 2007 there was 683 million outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 60 we intend to renew the receivables facility in march 2008 with comparable or similar terms and we do not have any reason to believe that we will not be able to do so 

on february 12 2007 we issued and sold 1000 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes the notes in a private placement offering pursuant to a note purchase agreement the notes are due february 12 2012 and accrue interest on the unpaid principal balance at a floating rate equal to a spread of 0600 over the threemonth libor as adjusted from time to time we used the net proceeds from the placement to pay down borrowings under the credit facility in february 2007 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the notes the swap agreement converts the notes’ variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 5088 on the initial notional amount of 1000 million which will decrease to a notional amount of 500 million in 2010 

 

as of december 31 2007 we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements related to our credit facility our notes and our receivables facility for additional information regarding our debt arrangements see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

our board increased the authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in the open market during 2007 including an increase to 1000 million in august 2007 as of february 22 2008 550 million of the authorized amount remained available we intend to continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we may use cash flows from operations to fund these purchases or we may incur additional debt 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and anticipated growth including expansion in existing and targeted market areas we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms additionally we may issue common or preferred stock to raise funds 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2007 our contractual obligations for longterm debt shortterm financing and operating leases were as follows in thousands 

 

this table does not include estimated future interest expense related to longterm debt and shortterm financing for additional discussion related to our debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

we have minimum purchase requirements under a limited number of vendor agreements primarily those related to the purchase of chemicals since these requirements are either based on a percentage of our total purchases for a product category or a minimum number of pounds of chemicals at prevailing market prices the amounts of these contractual obligations are not reasonably estimatable as of december 31 2007 and therefore are not included in the table above 

  

  

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt however we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan and our notes 

if i the variable rates on our revolver and our receivables facility increased or decreased 10 from the rate at december 31 2007 and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available as of december 31 2007 under the revolver 3150 million assuming that we exercised the 750 million accordion feature and the receivables facility 1500 million for all of 2007 then our pretax income would change by approximately 47 million and earnings per share would change by 006 per diluted share based on the number of weighed average diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2007 

currency risk 

we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada mexico the united kingdom france portugal spain and italy in the past we have not hedged our currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues operating expenses and earnings due to the size of our international operations however we do not anticipate that exposure to currency rate fluctuations will be material in 2008

pool’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to pool’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation any evaluation or projection of effectiveness to future periods is also subject to risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

based on industry data pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as pool we us or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 under the name scp holding corporation and in 1995 changed its name to scp pool corporation in 2006 the company changed its name to pool corporation this change acknowledges the company’s growth from a regional distributor to a multinational multinetwork distribution company    

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products and offering a range of services to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2006 we operated 274 sales centers in north america and europe 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 70 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 12 own a pool based upon industry data we believe the industry has grown at a 2 to 6 annual rate for the past several years higher rates of new home construction over the last 10 years particularly in larger pool markets have added to the market expansion opportunity for pool ownership 

we believe the swimming pool industry will continue to grow at a rate of approximately 2 to 6 annually over the next five years primarily because of favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends as well as the expected continued longterm growth in housing starts in warmer markets due to the population migration towards the south and the need to maintain the growing installed base of pools we expect our sales growth to be higher than the industry average due to increases in market share and expansion of our product offerings 

we believe that new pool and irrigation system starts are also impacted to some extent by general economic conditions as commonly measured by gross domestic product or gdp as well as certain housing market trends positive gdp trends may have a favorable impact on industry starts while negative trends may be unfavorable for industry starts we believe there may be some correlation between industry starts and the rate of housing turnover and home appreciation over time with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on starts over time we also believe that any cyclicality in housing starts like the slowdown in new home construction that began in 2006 will have a limited impact on our growth as most pools approximately 8090 are built after a home is constructed 

a large portion of consumer spending in our industry is derived from the maintenance of existing swimming pools including the repair and replacement of the equipment for those pools we believe that consumer demand for qualified pool builders in many markets will continue to exceed the supply which along with the recurring nature of the repair and replacement market has helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth historically 

the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations 

the industry has been positively impacted by the trend for increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment additionally the developing trend in recent years is for consumers to bundle the purchase of a pool with other products as part of a complete backyard makeover new irrigation systems and landscaping are often key components to completing a swimming pool installation or remodel the irrigation and landscape market has many characteristics in common with the pool industry and we believe that it benefits from the same favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends and will realize growth rates similar to the pool industry 

our industry is seasonal and weather is the principal external factor which affects our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september the industry is also affected by other factors including consumer saving and discretionary spending levels the increase in pool eligible households and consumer attitudes toward pool and landscape products for environmental or safety reasons 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are to promote the growth of our industry to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and to continuously strive to operate more effectively 

we promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with everything from site selection to store layout and design to business management system implementation 

we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we have increased our product breadth as described in the “customers and products” section below and expanded our sales center network through acquisitions and new sales center openings 

we have grown organically through increases in base business sales of 10 in 2006 14 in 2005 and 10 in 2004 since 2002 we have opened 32 new sales centers acquisitions have historically been an important source of sales growth as well and since 2002 we have successfully completed 11 acquisitions consisting of 72 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations 

in august 2006 we acquired a total of 14 sales centers through our acquisition of wickham for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k we intend to pursue additional strategic acquisitions which will allow us to further penetrate existing markets and expand into new geographic markets and product categories 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 70000 customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve five types of customers 

 

 

 

 

 

the majority of these customers are small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources 

we conduct our operations through 274 sales centers in north america and europe our primary markets which have the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 56 of our net sales in 2006 we use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from the sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 100000 national brand and private label products we believe that our selection of pool equipment and supplies chemicals replacement parts and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintenance products and repair and replacement parts are nondiscretionary in nature meaning that these items must be purchased by endusers to maintain existing swimming pools and landscaped areas over 60 of our gross profits are derived from the sale of products used to maintain and repair these existing features and less than 40 are derived from the construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of new pools and landscaping we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon distributors horizon network  which we acquired through acquisitions in 2005 and 2006 

our complementary product sales grew 26 in 2006 and accounted for over 9 of our total net sales at comparable margins to our traditional product offerings this growth has been an important factor in our base business sales growth over the past seven years with complementary product sales growing from approximately 30 million in 1999 to over 1800 million in 2006 

we have identified other product categories that could become part of our complementary product offerings in the future we typically introduce two to three categories each year in certain markets we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those which we believe exhibit longterm growth potential in 2007 we intend to continue to expand our complementary products initiative by increasing the number of locations which offer complementary products increasing the number of complementary products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of the product offerings on a companywide basis we expect total complementary product sales to approximate 10 of our total sales in 2007 

operating strategy 

we operate three distribution networks the scp distributors scp network the superior pool products superior network and the horizon network the scp network consists of 152 sales centers including 11 locations in europe the superior network consists of 62 locations and the horizon network consists of 60 locations 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products through our scp and superior networks and we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

 

we evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services including customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help achieve their goals we believe our incentive programs and feedback tools along with the competitive nature of our internal networks stimulate and enhance employee performance 

distribution 

our sales centers are located near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any sales center location or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 

our sales centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

in addition we operate five centralized shipping locations and five construction materials centers that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or directly to customers 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms are typically available to us for preseason or early season purchases 

we initiated a preferred vendor program in 1999 which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors we work closely with these vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and concentrate our purchasing activities these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have resulted in improved margins at the sales center level 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and waterpik technologies inc which accounted for approximately 16 11 and 6 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2006 

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states we are also one of the top three distributors of landscape and irrigation products in the united states and we compete against one national wholesale distributor of these products we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal distribution networks 

some geographic markets we serve particularly our largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona are more competitive than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brandname products if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights we might be materially and adversely affected we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 

we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

  

 

 

 

we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather 

for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including regulation by the environmental protection agency the department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the national fire protection agency and the international maritime organization most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of pool chemicals and landscape chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

employees 

we employed approximately 3600 people at december 31 2006 given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer when we add up to 15 more employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property 

we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our private label products that are important to our current and future business operations we also own rights to several internet domain names

 item 1a   risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements include the following 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is the principal external factor affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the fall can decrease the length of the pool season also unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to the success of our business we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool supply chain and landscape supply chain by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and waterpik technologies inc which accounted for approximately 16 11 and 6 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2006 a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retail customers and other endusers of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business additionally the loss of a single supplier could also adversely affect our business we dedicate significant resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe greatly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers and large pool or landscape supply retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 56 of our net sales in 2006 also tend to be more competitive than others 

more aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply retailers could adversely affect our sales 

 

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for direct and enduse customers which could have an adverse impact on our business we may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within the distribution channel 

the demand for our swimming pool and related outdoor lifestyle products may be adversely affected by   unfavorable economic conditions 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the increase in pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools account for more than 60 of our gross profits the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base which may be viewed by most consumers as a discretionary expenditure that could be adversely affected by economic downturns in addition even in generally favorable economic conditions severe andor prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

specifically our future success depends to an extent upon the continued service of manuel perez de la mesa our chief executive officer the loss of mr perez de la mesa in particular could have a material adverse effect on our business mr perez de la mesa is not nearing retirement age and we have no indication that he intends to retire in the near future we do not currently maintain key man insurance on mr perez de la mesa 

we may not be able to sustain our pace of growth 

we have experienced substantial sales growth in recent years through acquisitions and new sales center openings that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since 2002 we have opened 32 new sales centers and have completed 11 acquisitions these acquisitions have added 72 sales centers net of sales center closings and consolidations and a centralized shipping location to our distribution networks while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

the growth of our business depends on effective marketing programs 

the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base thus an important part of our strategy is to promote the growth of the pool industry through our extensive advertising and promotional programs that attempt to raise consumer awareness regarding the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns we believe these programs benefit the entire supply chain from our suppliers to our customers 

we also promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our programs include such things as personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training we also provide certain retail store customers with assistance in site selection store layout and design and business management system implementation our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising marketing and promotional programs to succeed in a weakened economic environment and an increasingly competitive marketplace in which we and our entire supply chain also compete with other luxury product alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2006 approximately 65 of our net sales and 93 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year which represent the peak months of swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of pool chemicals and landscape chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 20 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our sales centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations expose us to certain additional risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

we source certain products we sell including our private label products from asia and other foreign locations there is a significant risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner and we may also be subject to certain trade restrictions that prevent us from obtaining products fluctuations in other factors relating to foreign trade such as tariffs currency exchange rates transportation costs and inflation are beyond our control 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the terrorist attacks that took place on september 11 2001 in the us were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties some of which may materially impact our business discretionary spending on leisure products such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic uncertainty the potential for future terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties which could adversely affect our business for the short or longterm in ways that cannot presently be predicted

none 




 item 2   properties 

we lease the pool corporate offices which consist of approximately 50000 square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50 ownership interest we own three sales centers in florida all of our other properties are leased for terms that expire between 2007 and 2027 generally our sales center leases have three to seven year terms with only seven leases expiring beyond 2017 most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance 

our sales centers range in size from approximately 2000 square feet to 100000 square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations and construction materials centers range in size from 16000 square feet to 132000 square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center is redundant in a market under performing or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations 

the table below identifies the number of sales centers in each state and foreign country by distribution network as of december 31 2006 

 




 item 3   legal proceedings 

from time to time we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including product liability personal injury commercial contract and employment matters while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable we do not believe based on currently available facts that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2006 financial overview 

financial results 

our 2006 financial results reflect another year of strong growth net sales increased 23 in 2006 to 19 billion due to 2047 million of sales growth related to acquired sales centers and 1524 million of sales growth from our base business the 10 base business sales growth reflects the continued growth in the installed base of swimming pools market share gains through our execution of sales marketing and service programs that we offer to our customers inflationary price increases   passed through the supply chain 26 growth in complementary product sales and sales from new locations 

we believe the impact of weather on sales in 2006 was mixed with a favorable sales impact from near record high temperatures throughout much of the year across north america and negative sales impacts due to record precipitation in the northeast and much colder than average august and september temperatures which shortened the pool season in certain markets 

gross profit increased 25 in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to the increase in net sales our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin increased 40 basis points to 283 in 2006 the majority of this increase was attributable to the benefits achieved through our supply chain management initiatives including our preprice increase inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2005 and second quarter of 2006 gross margin also benefited from higher margin contributions from our acquired businesses and a slight shift in product mix to higher margin products these margin improvements were partially offset by a reduction in our earned vendor incentives as a percentage of total net sales 

operating expenses in 2006 increased 25 compared to 2005 this increase was higher than our 2006 sales growth rate due to higher expense ratios for our recently acquired businesses startup costs and higher expense ratios for the 17 new sales centers we opened in 2006 and expenses for other investments that expanded our sales center locations and valueadded programs examples of new programs that we launched in 2006 include a new branded retail customer program called the backyard place and a new pool financing brokerage business that enhances our swimming pool builder programs 

our operating income increased 24 in 2006 while our operating margin increased slightly to 88 of net sales from 87 in 2005 interest expense increased 136 in 2006 due to higher debt levels for borrowings to fund share repurchases and acquisitions and a higher average effective interest rate compared to 2005 net income increased 18 to 950 million compared to the same period in 2005 and included 16 million of net equity earnings from our investment in latham acquisition corporation lac 

financial position and liquidity 

cash provided by operations increased 296 million to 690 million in 2006 due primarily to the increase in net income compared to 2005 and the impact related to our fourth quarter 2005 early buy purchases in 2005 our cash provided by operations was negatively impacted by early buy inventory purchases that we received and paid for in the fourth quarter of 2005 this impact is reflected in the net change in our inventory and accounts payable balances between periods but the benefit to our 2006 cash provided by operations was largely offset by the decrease in accrued expenses which included a 270 million payment for estimated federal tax payments that were deferred from the second half of 2005 as allowed by the katrina emergency tax relief act of 2005 

coupled with net proceeds from other financing activities of approximately 906 million cash provided by operations helped fund the following in 2006 

 

 

 

 

 

our accounts receivable balance increased 9 to 1549 million at december 31 2006 including receivables related to the wickham acquisition days sales outstanding dso increased between periods to 359 days at december 31 2006 compared to 336 days at december 31 2005 as a result of the addition of horizon’s receivables which have slightly longer collection cycles since our dso calculation is based on trailing 12 month net sales horizon’s receivables are not included in the 2005 calculation excluding horizon from the 2006 calculation dso improved slightly to 331 days our allowance for doubtful accounts increased to 49 million at december 31 2006 from 42 million at december 31 2005 this increase reflects the higher receivables balance and a slight increase in our past due receivable balances as a percentage of total receivables 

our net inventory balance increased 15 million to 3321 million at december 31 2006 the december 31 2005 inventory balance included approximately 530 million of early buy inventory purchases that we received and paid for in the fourth quarter of 2005 to take advantage of vendor price discounts since we did not receive any significant early buy inventory during the fourth quarter of 2006 the december 31 2006 balance reflects increases of 139 million for our 17 new sales centers 85 million related to wickham and 321 million related to growth of our business and some product line expansion for construction materials and other complementary products inventory turns as calculated on a trailing 12 month basis have slowed to 39 times in 2006 from 43 times in 2005 due primarily to our significant preprice increase inventory purchases 

total debt outstanding increased to 2654 million at december 31 2006 compared to 1948 million at december 31 2005 this increase is attributable to increased borrowings to fund our 2006 share repurchases our acquisition of wickham and slightly higher working capital levels we continue to maintain a healthy current ratio which increased to 18 as of december 31 2006 compared to 16 as of december 31 2005 

recent developments 

recent economic trends include a slowdown in the domestic housing market with a sharp drop in new home construction and home value deflation in many markets and increases in shortterm interest rates some of the factors that have mitigated the impact of these trends on our business include the following 

 

 

 

however a more severe andor prolonged housing market slowdown may have a more direct impact on new pool construction that could negatively impact our sales 

outlook 

we believe that the following factors will contribute to net sales growth in 2007 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 2007 we expect to realize more sales growth relative to 2006 as the year unfolds based on tougher sales comparisons in the first half of the year we believe that complementary products will continue to grow at a faster rate than our overall sales growth 

we believe that gross margins will improve slightly in 2007 however we expect that our 2007 quarterly gross margins will be comparatively lower to 2006 in the first three quarters and higher in the fourth quarter due the benefits of our aggressive preprice increase early buys in the first three quarters of 2006 and to our third and fourth quarter 2006 vendor incentive adjustments the changes in our earned incentive estimates were recorded as cumulative catchup adjustments to the amounts recognized in our 2006 financial statements at the time of the adjustments 

we expect to continue to increase our focus on supply chain management initiatives including further expansion of international sourcing and private label opportunities particularly where margin expansion opportunities exist we also plan to make further advances in working capital management to achieve continued operational improvements in 2007 and beyond 

we expect a positive contribution from equity earnings from our investment in lac in 2007 lac’s business is highly seasonal and more heavily weighted to northern markets with the first and fourth quarters being the slowest parts of the year and the second and third quarters being the busiest   

we project that 2007 earnings per share will be in the range of 200 to 210 per diluted share which represents our long term guidance of 15 organic earnings per share growth plus the accretive benefits of already completed acquisitions and share repurchases this range includes an expected 009 impact from stock option expensing 

generally execution is the primary overall factor affecting the company’s results and weather is the most significant external factor we believe that over the long term we will generate sufficient cash flow and have adequate access to capital to both fund our business objectives and provide a direct return to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments 

our business is subject to significant risks including weather competition general economic conditions and other risks as detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

 

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we require payment from our customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographical location in the past credit losses have been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from 01 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each year we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than 25000 additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote such writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged less than 02 of net sales 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2006 pretax income would change by approximately 06 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 001 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2006 

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity sales centers classify products into 13 classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months all inventory is included in these classes except for nonstock special order items and products with less than 12 months of usage the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 

 

there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 and nonstock inventory as determined at the sales center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage on a companywide basis 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

our reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2006 pretax income would change by approximately 05 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 001 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2006 

vendor incentives 

we account for vendor incentives in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue 0216 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements we account for such incentives as if they are a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such incentives reduce cost of sales in our income statement 

throughout the year we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of cumulative purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable our estimates for cumulative purchases and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and trends as a result our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catchup adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to product already purchased they may lower or raise our gross margins for products sold in future periods 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2006 and in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  united states taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

 

we hold through our wholly owned affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including substantial amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions 

 

we have operations in 39 states and seven foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include differences between the estimated deferred tax liability that we have recorded for equity earnings in unconsolidated investments and the actual taxes paid upon the return of undistributed equity earnings through a manner other than a capital transaction as a result of these uncertainties our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation nofin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions we adopted fin 48 effective january 1 2007 as required and are currently in the process of implementing the provisions of the interpretation the cumulative impact of adopting fin 48 will be recorded in retained earnings we anticipate that the accounting under the provisions of fin 48 may provide for greater volatility in our effective tax rate as items are derecognized or as we record changes in measurement in interim periods 

incentive compensation accrual 

we have an incentive compensation structure designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses as a percentage of salaries based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recent completed fiscal year 

the objectives for our bonus plans are set at the inception of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans we record an incentive compensation accrual at the end of each month using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved towards the stated bonus plan objectives during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal year end we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific bonus plan objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans due to both the discretionary components of the bonus plans and the timing of the approval and payment of the annual bonuses our estimated quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts 

intangible assets 

our largest intangible asset is goodwill at december 31 2006 our goodwill balance was 1542 million representing 20 of total assets and 56 of stockholders’ equity goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  under these rules we test goodwill for impairment annually or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 

in october 2006 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test which requires comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill as a result of this test we believe the goodwill on our balance sheet is not impaired 

if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our estimated fair value has fallen below carrying value we will compare the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 

 

 

the following discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2006 2005 and 2004 we accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

we exclude the following sales centers from base business for 15 months 

 

 

 

additionally we generally allocate overhead expenses to acquired sales centers on the basis of acquired sales center net sales as a percentage of total net sales 

fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 

 

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2005 210 sales centers were included in the base business calculations and 64 sales centers were excluded because they were acquired or opened in new markets within the last 15 months the effect of sales center acquisitions in the table above includes the operations of the following 

 

1   after 15 months of operations we include acquired sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k  

net sales 

 

the increase in net sales is primarily a result of the horizon acquisitions and the growth in our base business 

base business sales growth was 10 in 2006 due primarily to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

new product initiatives continue to be focused on our complementary products category for which sales have grown from 30 million in 1999 to 1801 million in 2006 these products which our customers historically purchased from other suppliers carry gross margins comparable to our traditional product categories we no longer include horizon’s sales in our complementary product calculations 

gross profit 

 

base business gross profit growth of 12 contributed 487 million to the increase in 2006 while acquired sales centers accounted for most of the remaining increase 

gross margin increased 40 basis points in 2006 due primarily to the benefits achieved through our supply chain management initiatives including our preprice increase inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2005 and second quarter of 2006 we made aggressive early buy purchases during the fourth quarter of 2005 to take advantage of price discounts and to mitigate the impact of expected 2006 price increases and we made additional preprice increase purchases during the second quarter of 2006 that benefited our third quarter gross margins 

our gross margin improvement also includes slightly higher margin contribution from acquired businesses and a small favorable product mix shift in 2006 to higher margin products which is attributable to our successful sales initiatives including our expansion of parts product and complementary product offerings the overall increase in gross margin was partially offset by lower earned vendor incentives as a percentage of total net sales in 2006 this decrease reflects a lower aggregate vendor incentive rate compared to 2005 and a slight decrease between years in our annual purchase volumes as a percentage of total net sales the decrease in rate is due to lower incentives as a percentage of total net sales for our acquired businesses and a shift in purchasing mix to products with lower incentives primarily complementary products 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses grew 25 and as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points in 2006 due primarily to higher expense ratios for our recently acquired businesses and startup costs and higher expense ratios for new sales centers opened in 2006 we opened 17 sales centers in 2006 compared to only three sales centers in 2005 the 17 new locations include 11 new pool sales centers and six new horizon sales centers expenses related to other investments in our business also contributed to the increase in operating expenses we moved 24 existing sales centers to bigger locations expanded another 16 existing sales center locations opened two new construction material distribution centers and also launched two new valueadded customer programs among other new company initiatives in 2006 these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower employee bonuses in 2006 of approximately 40 million 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 88 million between periods as average debt outstanding was 79 higher in 2006 compared to 2005 the higher debt levels in 2006 reflect increased borrowings to fund share repurchases acquisitions and higher working capital levels the weighted average effective interest rate also increased to 58 in 2006 from 43 in 2005 

income taxes 

income taxes increased to 588 million in 2006 from 499 million in 2005 due to the 233 million increase in income before income taxes and equity earnings our effective income tax rate was 386 at december 31 2006 and 387 at december 31 2005 as adjusted for the impact of sharebased compensation expense 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 18 to 950 million in 2006 from 805 million in 2005 net income in 2006 included 16 million of net equity earnings from our investment in lac   diluted earnings per share increased 20 to 174 per share in 2006 from 145 per share in 2005 

fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 

 

for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2005 to the year ended december 31 2004 201 sales centers were included in the base business calculations and 45 sales centers were excluded because they were acquired within the last 15 months the base business calculation also excludes our north american manufacturing operations of which we divested in december 2004 the full impact of sharebased compensation expense has been included in the base business selling and administrative expenses the following sales center acquisitions and manufacturing operation divestitures are excluded from the base business calculations for the periods identified 

 

1   after 15 months of operations we include acquired sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period 

net sales 

 

base business growth of 14 contributed to the increase in net sales primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

we continue to focus new product initiatives on our complementary products category for which sales have grown from 30 million in 1999 to over 1400 million in 2005 in 2005 complementary product sales grew 32 over 2004 

the remaining increase in net sales is attributable to acquired sales centers including the horizon sales centers acquired in october 2005 

gross profit 

 

base business gross profit growth of 13 contributed 479 million to the increase in 2005 while acquired sales centers accounted for the remaining increase 

gross margin decreased to 279 in 2005 primarily due to a decrease of approximately 40 basis points related to the disposition of our north american manufacturing assets in december 2004 we also had a slight decrease in gross margin due to the impact of certain product price increases supplier price increases were much more pronounced in 2005 than in prior years due to significant price increases on certain chemicals used in the pool industry as well as increases in underlying commodity costs particularly oil and steel in certain product categories we were only able to pass along price increases on a dollar per unit basis rather than a percentage basis due to competitive pressures the overall decrease in gross margin was partially offset by improvements achieved through our focus on supply chain management and a shift in product mix to our higher margin products most notably in the fourth quarter 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points in 2005 as increases in employee related costs and freight expenses were offset by our ability to leverage much of our existing distribution infrastructure and personnel base to support our sales growth 

interest expense 

net interest expense increased to 64 million in 2005 from 39 million 2004 as a result of an increase in the effective interest rate to 43 in 2005 from 25 in 2004 and a 21 increase in the average debt outstanding the increase in the interest rate and higher average debt outstanding was partially offset by a 03 million decrease in the amortization of deferred financing fees 

income taxes 

income taxes increased to 499 million in 2005 from 409 million in 2004 primarily due to the 246 million increase in income before income taxes and equity earnings our effective income tax rate decreased to 387 at december 31 2005 from 392 at december 31 2004 due primarily to the anticipated impact of certain tax advantaged business strategies 

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 27 to 805 million in 2005 from 634 million in 2004 net income in 2005 included 15 million of net equity earnings from our investment in lac   diluted earnings per share increased 28 to 145 per share in 2005 from 113 per share in 2004 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2006 approximately 65 of our net sales and 93 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season   excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2006 and 2005 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of the swimming pool industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 

 

in the fourth quarter 2005 and full year 2006 our results of operations include the 40 horizon sales centers that we acquired in october 2005 we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers we attempt to open new sales centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the following peak selling season 

weather is the principal external factor affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 

 

in 2006 our sales benefited from near record high temperatures across much of north america this favorable impact was more pronounced in the first quarter of 2006 especially in our northern markets which experienced an earlier start to the pool season compared to 2005 while maintenance and impulse sales benefited from the near record high temperatures sales tied to pool construction and pool usage were hindered by above average precipitation in the northeast and northwest despite 2006 being the hottest year on record nationally sales were negatively impacted by much colder than average august and september temperatures which shortened the pool season in certain markets 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet current cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which combined with seller financing have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance our acquisitions the same principle applies to funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures   we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business returning money to our shareholders and maintaining an adequate debt structure generally we prefer to maintain a one to two times ebitda leverage ratio our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands 

 

our 2006 cash provided by operations increased 296 million compared to 2005 due primarily to the increase in net income and the impact related to our fourth quarter 2005 early buy purchases in 2005 our cash provided by operations was negatively impacted by early buy inventory purchases that we received and paid for in the fourth quarter of 2005 this impact is reflected in the net change in our inventory and accounts payable balances between periods but the benefit to our 2006 cash provided by operations was largely offset by the decrease in accrued expenses which included a 270 million payment for estimated federal tax payments that were deferred from the second half of 2005 as allowed by the katrina emergency tax relief act of 2005 the remaining increase in cash provided by operations is attributable to the change in our accounts receivable balance between periods 

our 2005 cash used in investing activities included 857 million for our acquisition of horizon in the fourth quarter of 2005 in 2006 our financing activities included 906 million of net proceeds from debt and cash related to our stock plans offset by 1111 million of total share repurchases and 211 million for the payment of our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders which we increased in the second quarter of 2006 the impact of our common stock repurchases reduced diluted weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 11 million shares for the year ended december 31 2006 

future sources and uses of cash 

our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility which matures on december 20 2010 now provides for 2200 million in borrowing capacity including a 1600 million fiveyear revolving credit facility the revolver and a 600 million term loan the term loan during the third quarter of 2006 we exercised the 400 million accordion feature under the revolver which increased our borrowing capacity from 1800 million to 2200 million the credit facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit 

at december 31 2006 there was 1312 million outstanding and 284 million available for borrowing under the revolver the weighted average effective interest rate on the revolver was approximately 61 for the year ended december 31 2006 

at december 31 2006 there was 600 million outstanding under the term loan of which 30 million is classified as current in december 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates effective on june 30 2006 the swap agreement converts our variable rate term loan to a fixedrate basis until its termination on december 31 2008 we have designated this swap as a cash flow hedge during the year ended december 31 2006 no gains or losses were recognized on this swap the weighted average effective interest rate of the term loan was approximately 55 for the year ended december 31 2006 

in march 2006 we renewed our accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility which provides a seasonal borrowing capacity of up to 1500 million through march 2007 the receivables facility provides for the true sale of certain of our receivables as they are created to a wholly owned bankruptcyremote subsidiary this subsidiary grants an undivided security interest in the receivables to an unrelated commercial paper conduit because of the structure of the bankruptcyremote subsidiary and our ability to control its activities we include the transferred receivables and related debt in our consolidated balance sheets we continue to employ this arrangement because it provides us with a lower cost form of financing at december 31 2006 there was 743 million outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 56 we intend to renew the receivables facility in march 2007 with comparable or similar terms and we do not have any reason to believe that we will not be able to do so 

as of december 31 2006 we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements related to our credit facility and our receivables facility for additional information regarding the credit facility see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

our board increased the authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in the open market twice during 2006 including an increase to 1000 million in november 2006 subsequent to year end we repurchased an additional 209 million or 572200 shares of our common stock on the open market leaving 718 million authorized for repurchases as of february 23 2007 we intend to continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we may use cash flows from operations to fund these purchases or we may incur additional debt 

on february 12 2007 we issued and sold 1000 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes the notes in a private placement offering pursuant to a note purchase agreement the notes are due february 12 2012 and will accrue interest on the unpaid principal balance at a floating rate equal to a spread of 0600 over the threemonth libor as adjusted from time to time we used the net proceeds from the placement to pay down borrowings under the credit facility in february 2007 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the notes the swap agreement converts the variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 5088 on the initial notional amount of 1000 million which will decrease to a notional amount of 500 million in 2010 for additional information regarding the notes see note 13 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and anticipated growth including expansion in existing and targeted market areas we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms additionally we may issue common or preferred stock to raise funds 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2006 our contractual obligations for longterm debt shortterm financing and operating leases were as follows in thousands

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt if i the variable rates on our credit facility and our receivables facility increased or decreased 10 from the rate at december 31 2006 and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available under the credit facility 2200 million and the receivables facility 1500 million for all of 2006 then our pretax income would change by approximately 19 million and earnings per share would change by 003 per diluted share based on the number of weighed average diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2006 

the fair value of our revolver is not affected by changes in market interest rates in december 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan the swap was in effect as of june 30 2006 and terminates on december 31 2008 

foreign exchange risk 

we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada mexico the united kingdom france portugal spain and italy in the past we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues operating expenses and earnings due to the size of our foreign operations however we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in 2007

pool’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to pool’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation any evaluation or projection of effectiveness to future periods is also subject to risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

 

pool’s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2006 pool’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

pool corporation 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that pool corporation formerly scp pool corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria pool corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that pool corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion pool corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on   the coso criteria

 item 1 business 

general 

based on industry data scp pool corporation the company  which may be referred to as pool  we  us or our  is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in 1993 under the name scp holding corporation and in 1995 changed its name to scp pool corporation 

in october 2005 we acquired automatic rain company a leading regional wholesale distributor of irrigation and landscape products serving professional contractors in the landscape construction and maintenance markets through our newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary horizon distributors inc horizon our acquisition of horizon expands our complementary product offerings and provides us with a solid distribution platform in the irrigation and landscape marketplace 

our industry is highly fragmented and as such we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products and offering a range of services to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own 

as of december 31 2005 we operated 246 customer service centers in north america and europe 

our industry 

we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young with room for continued growth from increased penetration of new pools of the approximately 69 million homes in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool approximately 12 own a pool the industry has grown at a 4 to 6 annual rate for the past several years new homes are being constructed at a higher rate over the last 35 years which creates even more potential pool owners annually 

we believe the swimming pool industry will continue to grow at a rate of approximately 4 to 5 annually over the next five years primarily because of favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends as well as the expected continued growth in housing starts in warmer markets and the need to maintain the growing installed base of pools we expect our sales growth to be higher than the industry average due to increases in market share and expansion of our product offerings 

a large portion of consumer spending in our industry is derived from the maintenance of existing swimming pools including the repair and replacement of the equipment for those pools we believe that consumer demand for qualified pool builders particularly in larger pool markets will continue to outweigh the supply thus the industry has generally not been negatively affected by economic downturns although there is no assurance that this will continue 

the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise and convenience the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations 

the industry has been positively impacted by the trend for increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment additionally the developing trend in recent years is for consumers to bundle the purchase of a pool with other products as part of a complete backyard makeover new irrigation systems and landscaping are often key components to completing a swimming pool installation or remodel the irrigation and landscape market has many characteristics in common with the pool industry and we believe that it benefits from the same favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends and will realize growth rates similar to the pool industry 

  

our industry is seasonal and weather is the principal external factor which affects our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically april through september the industry is also affected by other factors including consumer saving and discretionary spending levels the increase in pool eligible households and consumer attitudes toward pool and landscape products for environmental or safety reasons 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are to promote the growth of our industry to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and to continuously strive to operate more effectively 

we promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns and we use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with everything from site selection to store layout and design to business management system implementation 

we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we have increased our product breadth as described in the “customers and products” section below and expanded our service center network through acquisitions and new service center openings 

we have grown organically through increases in base business sales of 14 in 2005 10 in 2004 and 11 in 2003 since 2001 we have opened 23 new service centers acquisitions have historically been an important source of sales growth as well and since 2001 we have successfully completed 13 acquisitions consisting of 93 service centers net of service center closings and consolidations 

we acquired a total of 42 service centers in 2005 including 40 service centers through our acquisition of horizon in october 2005 for additional discussion of our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k we intend to pursue additional strategic acquisitions which will allow us to further penetrate existing markets and expand into new geographic markets and product categories for information regarding our sources and uses of cash you should read item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources” of this form 10k 

  

customers and products 

we serve roughly 68000 customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve five types of customers 

 

  

  

  

  

 the majority of these customers are small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources 

we conduct our operations through 246 service centers in north america and europe our primary markets which have the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 54 of our net sales in 2005 we use a combination of international and local sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our international personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from the service centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 100000 national brand and private label products we believe that our selection of pool equipment and supplies chemicals replacement parts and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 maintenance products and repair and replacement parts are nondiscretionary in nature meaning that these items must be purchased by endusers to maintain existing swimming pools and landscaped areas over 60 of our gross profits are derived from the sale of products used to maintain and repair these existing features and less than 40 are derived from the construction and installation equipment materials plumbing electrical etc of new pools and landscaping 

our complementary product sales grew 32 in 2005 excluding horizon and have grown from approximately 30 million in 1999 to over 1400 million in 2005 this growth has been an important factor in our base business sales growth over the past six years including horizon’s fourth quarter 2005 sales complementary products sales grew 76 over 2004 and accounted for nearly 12 of our total net sales at comparable margins to our traditional product offerings 

we have identified other product categories that could become part of our complementary product offerings in the future we typically choose two to three categories each year and introduce them in certain markets we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those which we believe exhibit longterm growth potential in 2006 we intend to continue to expand our complementary products initiative by 

  

increasing the number of locations which offer complementary products increasing the number of complementary products offered at certain locations and also through a modest broadening of the product offerings on a companywide basis we expect complementary product sales to approach 20 of our total sales in 2006 

operating strategy 

we operate three distribution networks the scp distributors scp network the superior pool products superior network and the horizon distributors horizon network the scp network consists of 145 service centers including 12 locations in europe the superior network consists of 61 locations and the horizon network consists of 40 locations 

we distribute swimming pool supplies equipment and related leisure products through our scp and superior networks and we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons 

 

  

 we evaluate our service centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services including customer and vendor related programs information systems support and expert resources to help achieve their goals we employ incentive programs and feedback mechanisms along with the competitive nature of our internal networks to stimulate performance 

distribution 

our service centers are located near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any service center location or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 

our service centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

in addition we operate five centralized shipping locations and two construction materials centers that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our service centers or directly to customers 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in our industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms are typically available to us for preseason or early season purchases 

we initiated a preferred vendor program in 1999 which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors we work closely with these vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and concentrate our purchasing activities these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have resulted in improved margins at the service center level 

  

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and waterpik technologies inc which accounted for approximately 20 13 and 7 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2005 

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states additionally we are one of the top three regional distributors of landscape and irrigation products in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal distribution networks we also compete against one national wholesale distributor of landscape and irrigation products 

some geographic markets we serve particularly our largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona are more competitive than others barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brandname products if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights we might be materially and adversely affected we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 

we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather 

for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including 

 

  

  

 most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of pool chemicals and landscape chemicals and fertilizers we store certain types of chemicals andor fertilizers at each of our service centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

  

employees 

we employed approximately 3200 people at december 31 2005 given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer when we add up to 15 more employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

intellectual property 

we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our private label products and we intend to maintain the trademark registrations that are important to our current and future business operations we also own rights to several internet domain names 

geographic areas 

net sales by geographic region were as follows for the past three fiscal years in thousands

additionally we have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics applicable to all employees officers and directors which is available free of charge on our website 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

cautionary statement for purposes of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

risk factors 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements include the following 

we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

weather is the principal external factor affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends can decrease the length of the pool season and unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance as well as landscape installations and maintenance these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” of this form 10k 

our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers 

as a distribution company maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to the success of our business we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool supply chain and landscape supply chain by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer us competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances however our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 

our largest suppliers are pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and waterpik technologies inc which accounted for approximately 20 13 and 7 respectively of the costs of products we sold in 2005 while we do not believe that the loss of any single supplier would adversely affect our business a decision by several suppliers acting in concert to sell their products directly to retail customers and other endusers of their products bypassing distribution companies like ours would have an adverse effect on our business we dedicate significant resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership which we believe greatly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 

we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 

we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry within our industry we compete against various regional and local distributors and to a lesser extent mass market retailers and large pool supply retailers outside of our industry we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures such as 

  

home remodelers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry some geographic markets that we serve particularly our largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 54 of our net sales in 2005 also tend to be more competitive than others 

more aggressive competition by mass merchants could adversely affect our sales 

mass market retailers today carry a limited range of and devote a limited amount of shelf space to merchandise and products targeted to our industry historically mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings they may become a more significant competitor for direct and enduse customers which could have an adverse impact on our business 

the demand for our swimming pool and related outdoor lifestyle products may be adversely affected by economic downturns 

in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending the increase in pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools account for more than 60 of our gross profits the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base which may be viewed by most consumers as a discretionary expenditure that may be adversely affected by economic downturns 

we depend on key personnel 

we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success as such our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including our executive officers and key management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our operating results could be adversely affected 

specifically our future success depends to an extent upon the continued service of manuel perez de la mesa our chief executive officer the loss of mr perez de la mesa in particular could have a material adverse effect on our business mr perez de la mesa is not nearing retirement age and we have no indication that he intends to retire in the near future we do not currently maintain key man insurance on mr perez de la mesa 

we may not be able to sustain our pace of growth 

we have experienced substantial sales growth in recent years through acquisitions and new service center openings that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution since 2001 we have opened 23 new service centers and have completed 13 acquisitions including our acquisition of horizon in october 2005 these acquisitions have added 93 service centers net of service center closings and consolidations and a centralized shipping location to our distribution networks while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion no assurance can be made as to our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

the growth of our business depends on effective marketing programs 

the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base thus an important part of our strategy is to promote the growth of the pool industry through our extensive advertising and promotional programs that attempt to raise consumer awareness regarding the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns we believe these programs benefit the entire supply chain from our suppliers to our customers 

we also promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our programs include such things as personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training we also provide certain retail store customers with assistance in site selection store layout and design and business management system implementation our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising marketing and promotional programs to succeed in a weakened economic environment and an increasingly competitive marketplace in which we and our entire supply chain also compete with other luxury product alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is highly seasonal 

in 2005 approximately 64 of our net sales and 89 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year which represent the peak months of swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental health transportation and safety regulations 

we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of pool chemicals and landscape chemicals and fertilizers for example we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws these laws are primarily related to labeling annual registration and licensing 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 20 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

we store chemicals fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire safety and casualty risks 

we store chemicals and fertilizers including certain combustible oxidizing compounds at our service centers a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection however we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability in addition changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

  

we conduct business internationally which exposes us to additional risks 

our international operations expose us to certain additional risks including difficulty in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations uncertain political and regulatory conditions foreign currency fluctuations adverse tax consequences and dependence on foreign economies 

we source certain products we sell including our private label products from asia and other foreign locations there is a significant risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner and we may also be subject to certain trade restrictions that prevent us from obtaining products fluctuations in other factors relating to foreign trade such as tariffs currency exchange rates transportation costs and inflation are beyond our control 

a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the terrorist attacks that took place on september 11 2001 in the us were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties some of which may materially impact our business discretionary spending on leisure products such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic uncertainty the potential for future terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties which could adversely affect our business for the short or longterm in ways that cannot presently be predicted

none 




 item 2 properties 

we lease the pool corporate offices which consist of approximately 50000 square feet of office space in covington louisiana from an entity in which we have a 50 ownership interest we own three service centers in florida all of our other properties are leased for terms that expire between 2006 and 2026 in addition to minimum rental payments which are set at competitive rates certain leases require reimbursement for taxes maintenance and insurance most of our leases contain renewal options some of which involve rent increases 

our service centers range in size from approximately 3000 square feet to 100000 square feet and generally consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations and construction materials centers range in size from 16000 square feet to 132000 square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate service center performance and site suitability and may relocate a service center or consolidate two locations if a service center is redundant in a market under performing or otherwise deemed unsuitable we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations 

  

the table below identifies the number of service centers by state and foreign country as of december 31 2005 

 

   




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including product liability personal injury commercial contract and employment matters while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable we do not believe based on currently available facts that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2005 financial overview 

financial results 

our 2005 financial results reflect the continuing execution of our strategies for profitable revenue growth we have built on our core strengths with a focus on growing our customers’ businesses faster than the overall market and incrementally improving all aspects of our business operations 

net sales grew 18 to 155 billion in 2005 compared to 131 billion in 2004 this is higher than the 13 sales growth experienced in 2004 due primarily to the increase in our base business growth rate as well as fourth quarter sales from acquired service centers which includes the 40 horizon service centers acquired in october 2005 our base business growth has been relatively stable at 14 10 and 11 for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively this growth contrasts with the growth of the overall market for swimming pool equipment and supplies which we estimate grew on average from 4 to 6 per year over this same time period we attribute much of our growth to the success of the programs we offer to our customers which are aimed at growing their businesses in 2005 product pricing also contributed to the sales growth as we were able to pass most vendor price increases through to customers 

our gross profit as a percent of net sales gross margin decreased by approximately 40 basis points in 2005 compared to 2004 reflecting the impact of the divestiture of our north american manufacturing assets in december 2004 

our operating income increased 24 to 1403 million in 2005 due primarily to the growth in sales as well as our ability to leverage our existing distribution and administrative infrastructure and our success with ongoing operational improvements net income increased 25 in 2005 and included 15 million of net equity earnings from our investment in latham acquisition corporation lac 

financial position and liquidity 

in 2005 both our cash flow provided by operations and yearend working capital balance were impacted by a greater amount of early buy inventory purchases that we received as of yearend we made aggressive inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of 2005 to take advantage of price discounts and to mitigate the potential adverse gross margin impact of expected 2006 price increases 

as a result of the inventory purchases received and paid for in the fourth quarter of 2005 which totaled approximately 530 million partially offset by the deferral of third and fourth quarter 2005 estimated federal income tax payments our cash from operations decreased to 381 million in 2005 from 564 million in 2004 coupled with net proceeds from financing activities of approximately 1195 million cash from operations helped fund our acquisition of horizon in the fourth quarter of 2005 321 million of share repurchases in 2005 and the payment of our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders which we increased in the second quarter of 2005 

our yearend inventory levels increased 69 to 3306 million as of december 31 2005 due primarily to our increased early buy inventory purchases and the horizon acquisition as a result of this increase inventory turns decreased slightly to 43 days in 2005 from 45 days in 2004 days sales outstanding dso remained consistent between years at 336 days for fiscal 2005 compared to 334 days for fiscal 2004 we continue to maintain a healthy current ratio which was down slightly to 16 as of december 31 2005 compared to 17 as of december 31 2004 

  

outlook 

we believe that the following factors will contribute to net sales growth in 2006 

 

      we believe that complementary products will continue to grow at a faster rate than our overall sales growth with an acceleration of the complementary products growth rate in the first three quarters of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 due to the addition of horizon’s products to our complementary product offerings including horizon’s sales complementary products should comprise approximately 20 of net sales for the full year 2006 

we expect to continue to increase our focus on supply chain management initiatives including expansion of international sourcing and private label opportunities particularly where margin expansion opportunities exist we also plan to make further advances in working capital management to achieve continued operational improvements in 2006 and beyond 

we expect a positive contribution from equity earnings from our investment in lac in 2006 lac’s business is highly seasonal and more heavily weighted to northern markets with the first and fourth quarters being the slowest parts of the year and the second and third quarters being the busiest 

we plan to use the modifiedretrospective transition method under sfas 123r sharebased payment  as such we will adjust prior period financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2006 to reflect the impact of stock option expense for amounts previously reported in our proforma footnote disclosures required by sfas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  our 2005 fully diluted earnings per share was 150 as reported or 145 after adjusting for the impact of stock option expense we believe that 2006 earnings per share will be in the range of 170 to 175 per diluted share including an expected 006 impact from stock option expensing 

we believe that over the long term we will generate sufficient cash flow and have adequate access to capital to both fund our business objectives and provide a direct return to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments 

our business is subject to significant risks including weather competition general economic conditions and other risks as detailed in item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management identifies critical accounting estimates as 

 

    

management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral consistent with industry practices we require payment from our customers within 30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers the extended terms require payments in equal installments in april may and june or may and june depending on geographical location in the past credit losses have been within or better than our expectations 

as our business is seasonal our customers’ businesses are also seasonal sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from 012 for amounts currently due up to 100 for specific accounts more than 60 days past due 

at the end of each year we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than 25000 additionally we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging as we review these past due accounts we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including 

 

    during the year we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote such writeoffs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts in the past five years writeoffs have averaged less than 02 of net sales 

if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2005 pretax income would change by approximately 08 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 001 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2005 

inventory obsolescence 

product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stockouts to provide the highest level of service to our customers to do this we maintain at each service center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume at the same time we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity service centers classify products into 13 classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months the table below presents a description of these inventory classes 

 

   

there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 14 because products in these classes generally turn quickly we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 513 which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit we provide a reserve of 5 for inventory in classes 513 as determined at the service center level we also provide an additional 5 reserve for excess inventory in classes 512 and an additional 45 reserve for excess inventory in class 13 we determine excess inventory which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage on a companywide basis 

in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence we consider a combination of factors including 

 

     our reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as changes occur in the aboveidentified factors 

if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20 at december 31 2005 pretax income would change by approximately 08 million and earnings per share would change by approximately 001 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2005 

vendor rebates 

we account for vendor rebates in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue 0216 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor many of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount of consideration payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors we account for such rebates as if they are a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product at which time such rebates reduce cost of sales in our income statement throughout the year we estimate the amount of the rebate earned based on our estimate of purchases to date relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the rebates we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels 

if market conditions were to change vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to product already purchased it may lower or raise our gross margins on products we sell or revenues earned in future periods 

incentive compensation accrual 

we have an incentive compensation structure designed to attract motivate and retain employees our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria with a small component based on management’s discretion we calculate bonuses as a percentage of salaries based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recent completed fiscal year 

  

the objectives for our bonus plans are set at the inception of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year we record an incentive compensation accrual as of each monthend using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved towards the stated bonus plan objectives during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal yearend we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific bonus plan objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans due to both the discretionary components of the bonus plans and the timing of the approval and payment of the annual bonuses our estimated quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts 

income taxes 

we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 

as of december 31 2005 and in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  united states taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

we hold through our affiliates cash balances in the countries in which we operate including substantial amounts held outside the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law may be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs act provided for a temporary 85 dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a oneyear period during the fourth quarter of 2005 we completed our analysis of the costs and benefits of repatriating funds under the jobs act and decided not to repatriate any of our foreign earnings therefore there was no impact from the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 

we have operations in 39 states and seven foreign countries the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities we are subject to regular audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire these adjustments may include differences between the estimated deferred tax liability that we have recorded for equity earnings in unconsolidated investments and the actual taxes paid upon the return of undistributed equity earnings through a manner other than a capital transaction as a result of these uncertainties our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed at december 31 2005 our goodwill balance was 1395 million representing 19 of total assets and 51 of stockholders’ equity 

  

we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  under these rules we test goodwill for impairment annually or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 

in october 2005 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test which requires comparison of our estimated fair value to our book value including goodwill as a result of this test we believe the goodwill on our balance sheet is not impaired 

if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our fair market value has fallen below book value we will compare the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its book value if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 

results of operations 

the table below summarizes information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years 

 

  

 the following discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2005 2004 and 2003 we accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates 

we exclude the following service centers from base business for 15 months 

 

   additionally we generally allocate overhead expenses to acquired service centers on the basis of acquired service center net sales as a percentage of total net sales 

  

fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 

 

 for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2005 to the year ended december 31 2004 201 service centers were included in the base business calculations and 45 service centers were excluded because they were acquired within the last 15 months the base business calculation also excludes our north american manufacturing operations that we divested in december 2004 the following service center acquisitions and manufacturing operation divestitures are excluded from the base business calculations for the periods identified 

 

  for information about our recent acquisitions see note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales 

 

 base business growth of 14 contributed to the increase in net sales primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

   

new product initiatives continue to be focused on our complementary products category for which sales have grown from 30 million in 1999 to over 1400 million in 2005 excluding horizon in 2005 complementary product sales grew 32 over 2004 these products which our customers historically purchased from other suppliers carry gross margins comparable to our traditional product categories 

the remaining increase in net sales is attributable to acquired service centers including the horizon branches acquired in october 2005 including horizon’s fourth quarter 2005 sales complementary products sales grew 76 over 2004 and accounted for 12 of total revenues for the full year 2005 

gross profit 

 

 base business gross profit growth of 13 contributed 479 million to the increase in 2005 while acquired service centers accounted for the remaining increase 

gross margin decreased to 279 in 2005 primarily due to a decrease of approximately 40 basis points related to the disposition of our north american manufacturing assets in december 2004 we also had a slight decrease in gross margin due to the impact of certain product price increases supplier price increases were much more pronounced in 2005 than in prior years due to significant price increases on certain chemicals used in the pool industry as well as increases in underlying commodity costs particularly oil and steel in certain product categories we were only able to pass along price increases on a dollar per unit basis rather than a percentage basis due to competitive pressures the overall decrease in gross margin was partially offset by improvements achieved through our focus on supply chain management and a shift in product mix to our higher margin products most notably in the fourth quarter 

operating expenses 

 

 operating expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 80 basis points in 2005 as increases in employee related costs and freight expenses were offset by our ability to leverage much of our existing distribution infrastructure and personnel base to support our sales growth 

interest expense 

net interest expense increased to 64 million in 2005 from 39 million 2004 as a result of an increase in the effective interest rate to 43 in 2005 from 25 in 2004 and a 21 increase in the average debt outstanding the increase in the interest rate and higher average debt outstanding was partially offset by a 03 million decrease in the amortization of deferred financing fees 

income taxes 

income taxes increased to 517 million in 2005 from 428 million in 2004 primarily due to the 241 million increase in income before income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased from 39 at december 31 2004 to 386 at december 31 2005 this decrease is due to the anticipated impact of certain tax advantaged business strategies 

  

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 25 to 836 million in 2005 from 669 million in 2004 this amount included 15 million of net equity earnings from our investment in lac which reflects a 09 million tax adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share increased 26 to 150 per share in 2005 from 119 per share in 2004 

fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 

 

 for purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended december 31 2004 to the year ended december 31 2003 195 service centers were included in the base business calculations and six service centers were excluded because they were acquired within the last 15 months the following service center acquisitions and service centers consolidations are excluded from the base business calculations for the periods identified 

 

    

net sales 

 

 base business growth of 10 contributed 1168 million to the increase while acquired service centers and service centers consolidated with acquired locations accounted for the remaining increase base business net sales increased primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

 gross profit 

 

 base business gross profit growth of 15 contributed 466 million to the increase in 2004 while acquired service centers and service centers consolidated with acquired locations accounted for the remaining increase base business gross margin improved to 284 in 2004 due primarily to improved selling and supply chain management practices 

operating expenses 

 

 operating expenses relating to the base business contributed 214 million to the increase in 2004 in order to support increased sales activity while acquired service centers and service centers consolidated with acquired locations accounted for the remaining increase 

base business operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 192 in 2004 from 193 in 2003 

interest expense 

net interest expense decreased to 39 million in 2004 from 47 million 2003 as a result of lower average outstanding debt in 2004 compared to 2003 a decline in the effective interest rate to 25 in 2004 from 26 in 2003 and a decrease of 05 million in amortization expense related to capitalized finance costs 

income taxes 

income taxes increased to 428 million in 2004 from 325 million in 2003 primarily due to the 264 million increase in income before income taxes our effective income tax rate remained unchanged at 39 at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 

  

net income and earnings per share 

net income increased 32 to 669 million in 2004 from 508 million while diluted earnings per share increased 31 to 119 per share in 2004 from 091 per share in 2003 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

our business is highly seasonal in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses in 2005 approximately 64 of our net sales and 89 of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year 

we typically experience a buildup of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 

the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2005 and 2004 we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts in our opinion this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data due to the seasonal nature of the swimming pool industry the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 

 

 in the fourth quarter 2005 our results of operations include the 40 horizon service centers that we acquired in october 2005 we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired service centers we attempt to open new service centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the following peak selling season 

  

weather is the principal external factor affecting our business the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 

 

 in 2005 our sales were negatively impacted by a late start to the pool season in northern markets due to less than favorable weather throughout much of the first quarter this decrease in sales was partially offset by increased sales attributable to above average temperatures during the fourth quarter of 2005 which helped to extend the pool season in certain markets 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet current cash needs we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings which combined with seller financing have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance our acquisitions the same principle applies for funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures our priorities for the use of cash are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

   

sources and uses of cash 

our 2005 cash from operations was 381 million or 46 of net income compared to net cash provided by operations of 564 million in 2004 the decrease in cash from operations in 2005 is primarily a result of our participation in vendor early payment incentives for early buy purchases received and paid for in the fourth quarter partially offset by the deferral of our third and fourth quarter 2005 estimated federal tax payments and higher net income 

in 2005 cash used in investing activities included 857 million for our acquisition of horizon in the fourth quarter of 2005 our financing activities included 1195 million of net proceeds from debt and the issuance of common stock under stock option plans offset by 321 million of share repurchases and 179 million for the payment of our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders which we increased in the second quarter of 2005 the impact of our common stock repurchases reduced diluted weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 03 million shares for the year ended december 31 2005 

future sources and uses of cash 

on december 20 2005 we amended our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility to provide for additional borrowing capacity the amended credit facility which matures on december 20 2010 provides for a 1200 million fiveyear revolving credit facility the revolver and a 600 million term loan the term loan the credit facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased from time to time by a total amount up to 400 million 

at december 31 2005 there was 691 million outstanding and 492 million available for borrowing under the revolver the average effective interest rate on the revolver was approximately 45 for the year ended december 31 2005 for additional information regarding the credit facility see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 of this form 10k 

in march 2005 we renewed our accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility which provides a seasonal borrowing capacity of up to 1000 million through march 2006 the receivables facility provides for the true sale of certain of our receivables as they are created to a wholly owned bankruptcyremote subsidiary this subsidiary grants an undivided security interest in the receivables to an unrelated commercial paper conduit because of the structure of the bankruptcyremote subsidiary and our ability to control its activities we include the transferred receivables and related debt in our consolidated balance sheet we employed this arrangement because it provides us with a lower cost form of financing at december 31 2005 there was 657 million outstanding under the receivables facility at an average effective interest rate of 40 

on february 17 2006 500 million remained available under the authorization of our board of directors for future share repurchases we intend to continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time depending on market conditions we may use cash flows from operations to fund these purchases or we may incur additional debt 

in the third quarter of 2006 our cash flows will be negatively impacted by payment of our third and fourth quarter 2005 estimated federal tax payments that have been deferred as allowed by the katrina emergency tax relief act of 2005 the act these payments which were originally deferred until february 2006 under the act will now be due in august 2006 as the internal revenue service has postponed the payment deadline for affected taxpayers 

we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and anticipated growth including expansion in existing and targeted market areas we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms additionally we may issue common or preferred stock to raise funds 

  

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2005 our contractual obligations for longterm debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands 

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt if i the variable rates on our credit facility and our receivables facility increased or decreased 10 from the rate at december 31 2005 and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available under the credit facility 2200 million and the receivables facility 1000 million for all of 2006 then our pretax income would change by approximately 26 million and earnings per share would change by 003 per diluted share based on the number of weighed average diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2005 

the fair value of our revolver is not affected by changes in market interest rates in december 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan the swap will be in effect as of june 30 2006 and terminate on december 31 2008 

foreign exchange risk 

we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada mexico the united kingdom france portugal spain and italy in the past we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues operating expenses and earnings due to the size of our foreign operations however we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in 2006 

 

   




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

the term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the act the rules refer to the controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified as of december 31 2005 management including the ceo and cfo performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation management including the ceo and cfo concluded that as of december 31 2005 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at ensuring that material information related to us or our consolidated subsidiaries is made known to them and is disclosed on a timely basis in our reports filed under the act 

we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states based on the most recent evaluation we have concluded that no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

pool’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to pool’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation any evaluation or projection of effectiveness to future periods is also subject to risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

pool’s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2005 pool’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

in october 2005 we acquired automatic rain company through our newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary horizon distributors inc in conducting its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 pool’s management did not include the internal controls of horizon distributors inc which constituted 8 and 14 of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2005 and 3 of net sales for the year then ended 

the registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of pool’s internal controls over financial reporting this report appears below 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders of scp pool corporation 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that scp pool corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria scp pool corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

business continued 

tableend a large portion of consumer spending in our industry is derived from the maintenance of existing swimming pools including the repair and replacement of the equipment for those pools thus the industry has generally not been negatively affected by economic downturns although there is no assurance that this will continue 

the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation entertainment family activity exercise convenience and landscaping the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling boats motorcycles recreational vehicles and vacations 

our industry is seasonal and weather is the principal external factor which affects our business peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year typically may through august the industry is also affected by other factors including consumer saving and discretionary spending levels the increase in pool eligible households and consumer attitudes toward pool products for environmental or safety reasons 

business strategy and growth 

our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees our three core strategies are to promote the growth of the industry to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and to continuously strive to operate more effectively 

we promote the growth of the swimming pool industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool may be enjoyed beyond swimming these programs include media advertising industryoriented website development such as wwwswimmingpoolcom ™ and public relations campaigns which are tools we use to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 

we promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers our uniquely tailored programs include such things as customer lead generation personalized websites brochures marketing campaigns and business development training as a customer service we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with everything from site selection to store layout and design to business management system implementation 

we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing procurement and logistics initiatives adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management 

in addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth we have increased our product breadth as described in the customers and products section below and expanded our service center network through acquisitions and by opening new service centers 

we have grown organically through increases in base business sales of 10 in 2004 11 in 2003 and 10 in 2002 since 2000 we have opened 28 new service centers acquisitions have historically been an important source of sales growth as well and since 2000 we have successfully completed 12 acquisitions consisting of 74 service centers net of service center closings and consolidations 

  

  

  

  

scp pool corporation 

part i 

 we intend to pursue additional strategic acquisitions although at a reduced rate from historical levels which will allow us to further penetrate existing markets and expand into new geographic markets and product categories for additional discussion of recent acquisitions read note 3 to the consolidated financial statements you should also read the liquidity and capital resources section of item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

customers and products 

we serve roughly 48000 customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve three types of customers 

 these customers are mostly small family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources we maintain a strict credit policy in the past losses from customer receivables have been within our expectations 

we conduct our operations through 203 service centers in north america and europe our primary markets which have the highest concentration of swimming pools are california florida texas and arizona representing approximately 51 of our net sales in 2004 we use a combination of national and local sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses our national personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities creating and enhacing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise our local sales personnel work from the service centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs 

we offer our customers more than 91000 national brand and private label products we believe that our selection of pool equipment and supplies chemicals replacement parts and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the swimming pool industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

    

  

  

  

  

scp pool corporation 

part i 

 maintenance products and repair and replacement parts are nondiscretionary in nature meaning that these items must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools over 60 of our gross profits are derived from the sale of products used to maintain and repair the installed base of pools and less than 40 are derived from the construction equipment building materials plumbing electrical of new inground and aboveground pools 

in 1999 in an effort to provide more of a onestop shopping experience for our customers we began to offer products which our customers traditionally purchased from other suppliers these products which we refer to as complementary products include 

 we have identified other product categories that could become part of our complementary product offerings in the future we typically choose two to three categories each year and introduce them in certain markets we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those which we believe exhibit longterm growth potential 

pool’s complementary products sales have grown from 3 million in 1999 to over 100 million in 2004 this growth has been an important factor in our base business sales growth over the past six years complementary product sales grew 27 in 2004 and accounted for nearly 8 of our total net sales at comparable margins to our traditional product offerings in 2005 we intend to continue to expand our complementary products initiative by increasing the number of locations which offer complementary products increasing the number of complementary products offered at certain locations and also through a modest broadening of the product offerings on a companywide basis we expect complementary product sales to approach 10 of our total sales in 2005 

operating strategy 

we operate two distribution networks in north america the scp distributors network scp and the superior pool products superior network the scp network consists of 142 service centers including 11 locations in europe and the superior network consists of 61 locations 

we adopted this strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks primarily for two reasons 

 

  

  

  

  

scp pool corporation 

part i 

 our service centers are evaluated based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures our corporate support groups provide our field operations with services including customer and vendor related programs systems and expert resources to use to help achieve their goals we employ incentive programs and feedback mechanisms along with the competitive nature of our internal networks to stimulate performance 

employees 

we employed approximately 2700 people at february 14 2005 given the seasonal nature of our business our peak employment period is the summer when we add up to 15 more employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 

distribution 

our service centers are located near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any service center location or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 

our service centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

in addition we operate five centralized shipping locations and two construction materials centers that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our service centers or directly to customers 

purchasing and suppliers 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in the swimming pool supply industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms are typically available to us for preseason or early season purchases 

we initiated a preferred vendor program in 1999 which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors we work closely with these vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and concentrate our purchasing activities these practices together with a more comprehensive service offering have resulted in improved margins at the service center level 

we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and waterpik technologies inc which accounted for approximately 16 9 and 7 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2004 

competition 

based on industry knowledge and available data management believes pool is the largest wholesale distributor in the swimming pool supply industry and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the pool industry in the united states we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a 

  

  

  

  

scp pool corporation 

part i 

 lesser extent massmarket retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal distribution networks some geographic markets we serve particularly our largest higher density markets in california florida texas and arizona are more competitive than others barriers to entry in the swimming pool supply industry are relatively low we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brandname products if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights we might be materially and adversely affected we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 

we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool supply distribution are 

 we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather 

see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” 

environmental health and safety regulations 

our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including 

  most of these requirements govern the packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of pool chemicals we store chemicals at each of our service centers the storage of these chemicals is strictly regulated by local fire codes in addition we sell algaecides that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and state pesticide laws these laws primarily relate to labeling and annual registration 

intellectual property 

we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our private label products and we intend to maintain the trademark registrations important to our business operations we also own rights to several internet domain names

legal proceedings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt if i the variable rates on our credit facility and our receivables facility increased or decreased 10 from the rate at december 31 2004 and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available under the credit facility 120 million and the receivables facility 100 million for all of 2005 then our pretax income would change by approximately 22 million and earnings per share would change by 002 per diluted share based on the number of weighed average diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2004 the fair value of our credit facility is not affected by changes in market interest rates 

foreign exchange risk 

we have whollyowned subsidiaries in canada mexico the united kingdom france portugal and spain in the past we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues operating expenses and earnings due to the size of our foreign operations however we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in 2005

controls and procedures 

tableend the term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the act the rules refer to the controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified as of december 31 2004 management including the ceo and cfo performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation management including the ceo and cfo concluded that as of december 31 2004 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at ensuring that material information related to us or our consolidated subsidiaries is made known to them and is disclosed on a timely basis in our reports filed under the act 

we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states based on the most recent evaluation we have concluded that no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

pool’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to pool’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation any evaluation or projection of effectiveness to future periods is also subject to risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

pool’s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2004 pool’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

operating strategy we operate two national distribution networks the scp distributors network scp and the superior pool products spp network the scp network consists of 141 service centers and the spp network consists of 57 locations 

we adopted this strategy of operating two distinct national distribution networks primarily for two reasons 

to offer our customers a choice of different distributors featuring distinctive product selections and relationships with manufacturers and to increase the level of customer service provided by the service centers in each network by promoting a healthy competition between the two networks products we offer more than 91000 national brand and private label products we believe that our selection of pool equipment and supplies chemicals replacement parts and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the swimming pool industry the products we sell can be categorized as follows 

maintenance products such as chemicals supplies and pool accessories repair and replacement parts for cleaners filters heaters pumps and lights packaged pool kits including walls liners bracing filters heaters pumps and lights for inground and aboveground pools and pool equipment and materials for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools maintenance products and repair and replacement parts are nondiscretionary in nature meaning that these items must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools these products together with replacement equipment account for approximately 80 of our net sales 

additionally since 1999 we have increased the breadth of complementary products we offer including building materials electrical supplies toys and games water and light features spas and spa accessories billiard tables patio furniture and artificial christmas trees 

scp pool corporation part i item 1 business customers and marketing we serve nearly 48000 customers none of which account for more than 1 of our sales we primarily serve three types of customers

we employ a sales force dedicated to developing and strengthening our customers’ businesses as of february 13 2004 a sales force of 240 business development representatives and 198 service center managers conduct our principal selling activities 

as discussed above our primary marketing activities aim to raise the profile of the swimming pool industry and educate consumers on the ease of maintenance and affordability of a swimming pool 

employees we employed approximately 2450 people at february 13 2004 

distribution our service centers are located near customer concentrations typically in industrial commercial or mixeduse zones customers may pick up products at any service center location or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 

our service centers maintain wellstocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving inventory control picking packing and shipping functions 

in addition we operate four centralized shipping locations that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our service centers 

purchasing and suppliers we initiated a preferred vendor program in 1999 which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors our service centers are also encouraged to ensure accurate pricing and greater discipline at the point of sale these practices have resulted in improved margins at the service center level 

we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers who generally offer competitive pricing return policies and promotional allowances it is customary in the swimming pool supply industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool these terms are typically available to us for preseason or early season purchases 

scp pool corporation part i item 1 business we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost service and quality standards our largest suppliers include pentair corporation hayward pool products inc and biolab inc a subsidiary of great lakes chemicals inc which accounted for approximately 16 11 and 7 respectively of the cost of products we sold in 2003 

competition we are the leading wholesale distributor in the swimming pool supply industry we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent massmarket retailers and large pool supply distributorsretailers some geographic markets we serve particularly our largest higher density markets in florida california texas and arizona are more competitive than others barriers to entry in the swimming pool supply industry are relatively low 

we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brandname products if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights we might be materially and adversely affected we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 

we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool supply distribution are 

the breadth and availability of products offered the quality and level of customer service the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs competitive product pricing and consistency and stability of business relationships with customers we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 

seasonality and weather see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” 

environmental health and safety regulations our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and federal state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including 

the emergency planning and community righttoknow act and other environmental protection agency regulations the hazardous materials transportation act and other department of transportation regulations and the occupational safety and health act osha 4

our service centers range in size from approximately 3000 square feet to 100000 square feet and consist of warehouse counter display and office space our centralized shipping locations range in size from 22000 square feet to 34000 square feet 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate service center performance and may relocate a service center or consolidate two locations if a service center is redundant in a market under performing or otherwise deemed unsuitable 

we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations and alternate sites are presently available at market rates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes further in the event of changes of such magnitude we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 

interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our longterm debt to mitigate this risk in may 2003 we entered into an interest swap agreement with variable notional amounts the swap became effective september 30 2003 and expires may 28 2004 if i the variable rates on our revolving credit facility increased or decreased 10 from the rate at december 31 2003 and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility 1300 million and the receivables facility 900 million for all of 2004 then our pretax income would change by approximately 20 million and earnings per share would change by 003 per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december 31 2003 the fair value of our revolving credit facility is not affected by changes in market interest rates 

foreign exchange risk we have whollyowned subsidiaries in canada mexico the united kingdom france portugal and spain in the past we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues operating expenses and earnings due to the size of our foreign operations however we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in 2004

scp pool corporation cautionary statement for purpose of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forwardlooking information that involves risks and uncertainties our forwardlooking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events including projections of future performance statements of management’s plans and objectives future contracts and forecasts of trends and other matters you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “believe” “will likely result” “outlook” “project” and other words and expressions of similar meaning no assurance can be given that the results in any forwardlooking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors which could cause them to differ materially for these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 

certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements include the following 

weather   weather is the principal external factor affecting our business for example unseasonably late warming trends can decrease the length of the pool season and unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use installation and maintenance 

seasonality our business is highly seasonal in 2003 approximately 66 of our net sales were generated in the second and third quarters of the year which represent the peak months of swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and 100 of our operating income was generated in the same period our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when we may incur net losses 

competition   we face competition from both outside our industry with sellers of other leisure product alternatives such as boats and motor homes and from within our industry with various regional and local distributors several companies that distribute swimming pool supplies on a national basis and to a lesser extent mass market retailers and large pool supply retailers new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry our largest geographic markets that we service such as california texas and florida also tend to be more competitive than others 

general economic conditions our industry is somewhat dependent upon overall economic and market conditions for example in economic downturns the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending new housing construction and swimming pool construction decline 

environmental health transportation and safety regulation we are subject to regulation under federal state and local environmental health transportation and safety requirements which govern such things as packaging labeling handling transportation storage and sale of pool chemicals and other products failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief moreover compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 20 years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes the clear trend in environmental health transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment such as the use and handling of chemical substances and protect the health and safety of individuals increasingly strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other businesses throughout the united states and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly in order to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

fire safety and casualty we store chemicals at our service centers and central stocking locations including certain combustible oxidizing compounds a fire explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire safety and casualty losses and related liability claims 

growth   we have experienced substantial growth in recent years through acquisitions and the opening of new locations that have increased our size scope and geographic distribution while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion no assurance can be made as to our ability to penetrate new markets identify appropriate acquisition candidates complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate 

scp pool corporation cautionary statement for purpose of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 continued acquired businesses obtain financing generate sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and general operating activities maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships and identify and divest assets which do not continue to create value consistent with our objectives 

international operations  during 2003 international sales accounted for approximately 5 of our total net sales we anticipate that future international sales will increase and may account for a more significant percentage of our sales risks associated with our international operations include political and economic instability export controls foreign government tax policies and regulatory requirements united states and foreign government policy changes convertibility and transferability of international currencies and restrictions on the movement of funds or goods 

key personnel out future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the loss of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

supplier relationships we presently purchase product from over 1200 manufacturers our inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business 

marketing   our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising marketing and promotional programs to succeed in a weakened national economy and an increasingly competitive marketplace in which we also compete with other luxury product alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition changes in public and consumer tastes could also have an effect on our business 

laws and regulations changes in laws and regulations including i healthcare reform initiatives in the united states at the state and federal level and in other countries ii tax rate changes new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations in the united states and certain foreign countries and iii changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

other factors other factors that may impact our business include acts of war or terrorist incidents future litigation governmental proceedings and labor relations and disputes 

the foregoing factors are not exhaustive and new factors may emerge which impact our business it is impossible for us to predict all such factors therefore forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future results we cannot guarantee that any future event or result will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions should additional risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from those anticipated investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements
