the following represents a list of our major competitors 



although these companies offer competing brands in categories we participate in they are also our partners and customers as they purchase beverage concentrates or kcup pods directly from us 

our material resources 

our raw materials 

the principal raw materials we use in our business which we commonly refer to as ingredients and materials approximate 59 of our cost of sales and include green coffee pet bottles and caps including both virgin and rpet aluminum cans and ends sweeteners paper products kcup pod packaging materials fruit glass bottles and enclosures juices teas water and other ingredients we also use postconsumer recycled materials in the manufacturing of our single serve brewers the availability quality and costs of many of these materials have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time 

when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process and transportation to our customers through the use of various commodity derivative contracts or supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position 

ingredients and materials excluding green coffee  under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans and ends natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pods pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

green coffee we purchase green coffee through outside brokers we also develop and pursue direct relationships with farms estates cooperatives and cooperative groups in order to support our broader traceability and sustainable supply chain initiatives during 2021 nearly 100 of our delivered purchases of green coffee were responsibly sourced through third party sourcing programs with the remaining purchased as conventional coffee due to increased demand and covid19related impacts responsibly sourced means the coffee we purchase is grown and sold in adherence to a credible sourcing program that aligns with our supplier code of conduct 

energy costs in addition to ingredients and packaging costs we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs which can also fluctuate substantially due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution operations and the energy costs consumed in the production process the fuel costs associated with our distribution operations are reflected within our sga expenses

during 2021 we rolled out an extensive diversity and inclusion training program across all employees except for frontline hourly employees which provides weekly engagement in an online content platform and regular opportunities to apply practice and reinforce the learnings from the program over the course of several months in 2022 the concepts from the program will be shared through trainings and meetings designed to embed these concepts in the culture of our hourly frontline employees

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our operations 

widespread health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the ongoing covid19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic in countries where we operate or our customers and suppliers are located due to recommendations or mandates from governmental and local authorities to require vaccinations close businesses limit travel avoid large gatherings or selfquarantine as well as temporary closures or decreased operations of the facilities of our customers distributors or suppliers these impacts include but are not limited to 

• significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products as a result of among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other restrictions store closures or financial hardship shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling or similar activity reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with the covid19 pandemic such impacts could further increase the difficulty of operating our business during the pandemic including accurately planning and forecasting customer demand 

• inability to meet our consumers and customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements such as the loss or disruption of essential raw materials or purchased finished goods disruption of logistics reduction or loss of workforce due to the insufficiency or failure of our safety protocols or disruption of other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• failure of third parties including those located in international locations on which we rely including our suppliers bottlers distributors contract manufacturers thirdparty service providers contractors commercial banks and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or to timely meet those obligations or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties or 

• significant changes in the conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to perform necessary business functions restrict or prevent consumers from having access to our products or otherwise prevent our thirdparty bottlers distributors partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products 

all of these impacts could place limitations on our ability to execute on our business plan and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we continue to monitor the situation have actively implemented policies and procedures to address the situation and as the pandemic continues to further unfold we may adjust our current policies and procedures as regulations or governmental orders are implemented or more information and guidance become available the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein any of which could have a material effect on us as this situation continues to evolve new risks or uncertainties may arise that we are not aware of currently 

costs and supply for inputs to our products including raw materials and transportation may change substantially and shortages have occurred and may continue to occur 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its resulting impacts on the global economy particularly supply chain constraints and labor shortages have led to inflation in input costs logistics manufacturing and labor costs we have experienced supply chain disruptions and significant inflation which have impacted our results of operations in the current year and may continue to do so in the future 

our raw materials are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base and their cost can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs price increases for our raw materials have placed pressure on our costs and could continue to do so and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers furthermore any price increases passed along to our customers or consumers could significantly reduce demand for our products and could negatively affect our business and financial performance in addition price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for marktomarket changes in the derivative instruments 

our principal raw materials in our coffee business include coffee beans and kcup pod raw materials including cups filter paper and other ingredients used in the manufacturing of our kcup pods we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean coffee and related coffee products the quality of the coffee we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price of coffee this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price increase the price of highquality coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts 

the supply and price of crops we purchase such as coffee apples and corn can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease such as coffee rust general cost increases in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of various commodities through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting supplies 

speculative trading in commodities such as coffee has and may continue to influence prices if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of our commodities due to any of the factors described herein or a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our products which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we also have a limited number of suppliers for certain strategic raw materials critical to our operations we may have limited leverage to negotiate with these suppliers which could negatively affect our operations and the financial performance of our business in addition in order to ensure a continuous supply of highquality raw materials some of our inventory purchase obligations include longterm purchase commitments for certain strategic raw materials the timing of these may not always coincide with the period in which we need the supplies to fulfill customer demand this could lead to higher and more variable inventory levels andor higher raw material costs for us 

if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation disruption government regulation political instability cybersecurity attacks and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

some of our raw materials and finished products are sourced or manufactured overseas and shipped to the us and canada changes in the global ocean transport market including shortages of shipping containers and availability of us and canadian ports have resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs of transportation for our raw materials and finished products which may impact our results of operations 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business and therefore may be significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution business and our use of thirdparty carriers 

we operate in intensely competitive categories 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences some of our competitors such as cocacola pepsico the kraft heinz company and nestlé sa are multinational corporations with significant financial resources these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products changing their route to market reducing prices or increasing promotional activities we also compete with a number of smaller brands and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

our sales may be negatively affected by numerous factors including our inability to maintain or increase prices our inability to effectively promote our products ineffective advertising and marketing campaigns new entrants into the market the decision of wholesalers retailers or consumers to purchase competitors products instead of ours increased marketing costs and higher instore placement and slotting fees driven by our competitors willingness to spend aggressively competitive pressures may also cause us to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our ability to increase such prices in addition the rapid growth of ecommerce may create additional consumer price deflation by among other things facilitating comparison shopping and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy routetomarket strategies and thus negatively affect revenues 

a significant percentage of the coffee systems segments financial performance is attributable to sales of kcup pods for use with keurig brewing systems we compete for sales of kcup pods against local and regional brands as well as against private label brands developed by retailers our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the countries in which we operate or in various local marketplaces or maintain or enhance our relationships with our partners and customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors including as a result of increased consolidation in the food and beverage industry and a significant increase in the number of competitive pod contract manufacturers 

continued acceptance of keurig brewers and sales of kcup pods to an increasing installed customer base are significant factors in our coffee systems growth plans any substantial or sustained decline in the sale of keurig brewers failure to continue to reduce the cost of keurig brewers or substantial or sustained decline in the sales of kcup pods could materially and adversely affect our business keurig brewers compete against all sellers and types of coffeemakers if we do not succeed in continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing keurig brewers or differentiating keurig brewers from our competitors in the coffeemaker category based on technology quality of products desired brands or otherwise or our competitors adopt their respective strategies our competitive position may be weakened 

product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products including beverage products and our brewers we have various quality environmental health and safety supply chain standards a failure or perceived failure to meet our quality or safety standards including product contamination or tampering or allegations of mislabeling whether actual or perceived could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers manufacturers distributors or suppliers this could result in time consuming and expensive production interruptions recalls market withdrawals product liability claims and negative publicity it could also result in the destruction of product inventory lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time fines from applicable regulatory agencies and higherthananticipated rates of warranty returns and other returns of goods moreover negative publicity may result from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls 

any or all of these events may lead to a loss of consumer confidence and trust could damage the goodwill associated with our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products and could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and shopping behavior which could impact our financial results 

consumers’ preferences continually evolve due to a variety of factors including changing demographics of the population social trends changes in consumer lifestyles and consumption patterns concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of products concerns regarding the location of origin or source of ingredients and products changes in consumers spending habits negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds and the use of natural organic or simple ingredients in beverages the demand for csds has therefore decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs such as water readytodrink coffee and teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate and respond to these changing trends and consumer beverage preferences our sales and growth could suffer 

consumers are also increasingly focused on sustainability with particular attention to the recyclability of product packaging reducing consumption of singleuse plastics and nonrecyclable materials and the environmental impact of manufacturing operations if we do not meet consumer demands by continuing to provide recyclable packaging options and focusing on sustainability throughout our manufacturing operations our sales could suffer 

in addition consumer shopping behavior is rapidly evolving due to both changes in travel vacation and leisure activity patterns and the acceleration of ecommerce and other methods of purchasing products if we are unable to meet the consumer where and when they desire their products or if we are unable to respond to changes in distribution channels including ecommerce our financial results could be adversely impacted 

if we do not innovate rapidly and successfully to respond to shifting consumer demands our business may suffer achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating results 

if we do not successfully manage our investments in new business strategies or integrate and manage our acquired businesses or brands our operating results may adversely be affected 

from time to time we expect to acquire businesses or brands invest in emerging companies andor form joint ventures and enter into various licensing and distribution agreements to expand our product portfolio in evaluating such endeavors we will be required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business strategies opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and cost of potential liabilities furthermore we may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with any such transaction including in connection with the integration or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures we may also experience delays in extending our respective internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in our financial records and in our consolidated financial statements we also regularly pursue productivity initiatives which are focused on strategic opportunities in procurement manufacturing and logistics as well as cost savings and tax initiatives these strategic initiatives may include investments in new technologies and optimization and relocation of our manufacturing and distribution footprint new ventures and investments are inherently risky and may not be successful and we may face challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from such investments or ventures any acquisitions investments or ventures may also result in the diversion of management attention and resources from other initiatives and operations 

our financial performance will depend in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands and the success of our other investments and ventures we may not achieve the strategic and financial objectives for such transactions if we are unable to achieve such objectives our consolidated results could be negatively affected 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have programs to invest and upgrade our manufacturing distribution and other facilities including expansive investments in manufacturing facilities in spartanburg south carolina newbridge ireland and allentown pennsylvania in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced delays in the construction of our new facilities and the production equipment contained within and we may continue to experience such delays we may continue to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones additionally we rely on third parties for the construction and renovation of our facilities and manufacturing of our production equipment if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated the investments and upgrades are not sufficient to meet our nearterm future business needs our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities or third parties fail to complete the construction or renovation of facilities or production equipment in a timely manner or in accordance with our specifications our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

substantial disruption at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at the facilities of our suppliers bottlers contract manufacturers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease epidemics strikes labor shortages transportation or supply interruption contractual dispute government regulation cybersecurity attacks or terrorism moreover if demand increases beyond our production capabilities we would need to either expand our capabilities internally or acquire additional capacity alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more than existing facilities or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend against claims we cannot be certain that the steps taken to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries third parties own certain trademarks or other intellectual property that we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola outside north america adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could also negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license rights to distribute thirdparty products the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

risks related to our financial performance 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

as of december 31 2021 we had 50598 million of total assets of which 20182 million were goodwill and 23856 million were other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinitelived intangible assets in connection with brands trade names acquired technology customer relationships and contractual arrangements we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances some of which are beyond our control factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products andor the product category resulting in diminished longterm revenue growth ii higher commodity or transportation prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition iv not achieving forecasted productivities v significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and vi changes in our discount rates which could change due to factors such as movement in risk free interest rates changes in general market interest rates and market beta volatility and changes to managements view of forecasted risk among others since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate 

our level of indebtedness could adversely affect us including decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense 

in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all if our financial performance does not meet current expectations our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

additionally in assessing our credit strength credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as our results of operations and financial position at the time if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodologies in assessing our credit strength the credit agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our current or future results of operations and financial position or for any other reason our cost of borrowing could increase furthermore a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could limit a financial institutions willingness to participate in our accounts payable program and reduce the attractiveness of the accounts payable program to participating suppliers who may sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions in addition a significant downgrade in our credit ratings may reduce flexibility of our business to engage in certain transactions such as the execution and renewal of certain leases 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and may affect our ability to operate our business 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict our ability including certain subsidiaries to incur debt and our ability including certain subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions our ability including certain subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and reduce our free cash flow 

in october 2021 our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 4 billion of our outstanding common stock beginning on january 1 2022 potentially enabling us to return value to shareholders our repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares our share repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase shares or conduct future share repurchase programs and we cannot guarantee that any such programs will result in longterm increases to shareholder value 

risks relating to labor and employment 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel 

our future success depends upon the continued contributions of senior management and other key personnel and the ability to retain and motivate them if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate the senior management team and other key personnel sufficiently to support the projected growth and initiatives of our business our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

labor shortages employee turnover and increases in wages could significantly impact our operations 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its resulting impacts on the global economy have exacerbated employee turnover and led to labor shortages particularly in the market for frontline employees in the production and distribution environments the labor force has been and may continue to be impacted by a number of factors related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic including government actions such as vaccination mandates unemployment benefits and subsidies and laws and regulations related to employee health and safety additionally competition in the labor marketplace for qualified employees has led to increased costs such as higher wages in order to recruit and retain employees a prolonged labor shortage or inflation in labor costs could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience union activity including labor disputes or work stoppages 

approximately 8000 of our employees worldwide are covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in labor disputes strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing renewed or expanded agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

increases in our cost of employee benefits in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we will actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that it will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward cost pressure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

risks relating to our relationships with third parties 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices and more favorable trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or trade terms that are favorable to retailers our respective margins would be reduced retailers also have leverage to require us to provide increased marketing and promotional expenditures including larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs as well as to demand fines for late or incomplete product shipments if we and our partners including bottlers distributors and licensees do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer in addition certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products’ retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands accordingly the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers 

if we are unable to offer terms that are acceptable to our significant customers or such customers determine that they need fewer inventories to service consumers these customers could reduce purchases of our products or may increase purchases of products from competitors which would harm our sales and profitability furthermore the loss of sales from a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we depend on thirdparty bottling and distribution companies for a significant portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to thirdparty bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segment’s operations generate a significant portion of our overall income from operations some of these bottlers are also our direct competitors or also bottle and distribute products for our competitors the majority of these bottlers’ business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors’ products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors’ products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products prioritize their own products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories to protect our route to market and may not be able to pass price increases through to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond their control and their business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of thirdparty bottlers 

failure to maintain strategic relationships with brand owners and private label brands could adversely impact our future growth and business potentially resulting in the termination of those agreements 

in our coffee systems segment we have entered into strategic relationships for the manufacturing distribution and sale of kcup pods with partner customers as well as with retailers for their private label brands as independent companies our strategic partners make their own business decisions which may not align with our interests if we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our strategic partners through a combination of premium performance and service pricing and marketing and advertising support or if these strategic partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and technological or other development efforts they may take actions that adversely impact us including entering into agreements with competing pod contract manufacturers or vertically integrating to manufacture their own kcup pods increasing competition among kcup pod manufacturers and moving to vertical integration may result in price compression which could have an adverse effect on our gross margins the loss of strategic partners could also adversely impact our future profitability and growth awareness of keurig brewers our ability to attract additional branded or private label parties to do business with us or our ability to attract new consumers to buy keurig brewers 

in our packaged beverages segment we have entered into strategic relationships for the manufacture andor distribution of products from partner brand owners in emerging or fastgrowing segments in which we may not currently have a brand presence we are subject to a risk of our partner brands terminating their agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance within each distribution agreement we have certain protections in case the partner brands terminate their agreements such as a onetime termination payment 

we rely on the performance of a limited number of suppliers manufacturers and order fulfillment companies for our brewers 

a small number of companies manufacture the vast majority of our brewers with a majority of the brewers we sell procured from one thirdparty brewer manufacturer if these manufacturers are not able to scale their manufacturing operations to match increasing consumer demand for our brewers at competitive costs our overall results will be negatively affected 

general risk factors 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us canada mexico the caribbean or other geographies where we do business may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings we may be impacted by consumer price sensitivity associated with many of our products similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to supply materials timely additionally these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we also face counterparty risk for our cash investments and derivative instruments declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity due to impacts on our suppliers customers and operating costs 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements 

financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face including their ability to access working capital could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them the timing of settlement for our obligation to the supplier or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers and to the extent these difficulties impact the timing of settlement for our obligation to the supplier we may have a decrease in our cash flow from operations and may have to use our various financing arrangements for shortterm liquidity needs 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results 

while our operations are predominately in the us we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales expenses profits assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso the canadian dollar and the euro as well as other foreign currencies in which we transact business we may continue to hedge a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing derivative instruments for certain transactions however we are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations 

as a result our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates moreover any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit gross margin and income from operations from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year 

we continue to be exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that we may not be able to manage through derivative instruments and may incur material losses from such transactions utilizing derivative instruments 

weather natural disasters water availability and climate change or related legislation could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather natural disasters or longterm climate changes are expected to add volatility to commodity prices and have the potential to disrupt the availability of raw materials energy and fuel our ability to produce and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months or unusually warm weather during the winter months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

global climate change poses a serious threat to communities businesses farmers and ecosystems across the world climate change is already affecting the agricultural sector and disruptions to crop growing conditions are expected to increase with extreme weather events increasing temperatures and changing water availability water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

we are also faced with the impact of disruptions to crop growing conditions as a result of changing weather patterns which can cause changes in geographical ranges of crops as well as weeds diseases and pests that affect those crops these impacts may limit availability or increase the price volatility of key agricultural commodities such as coffee corn and tea which are important sources of ingredients for our products 

concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we will operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

us and international laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

our products are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we conduct business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety sourcing labeling storing transportation marketing advertising distribution and sale of our products other laws and regulations that may impact our business relate to the environment relations with distributors and retailers employment privacy health and trade practices our expanding international business will also expose us to economic factors regulatory requirements increasing competition and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries our international business is also subject to us laws regulations and policies including anticorruption and export laws and regulations 

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacturing safety sourcing labeling storing transportation advertising distribution and sale of our products could damage our reputation andor result in criminal civil or administrative actions with substantial financial penalties and operational limitations in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures or significant challenges to our ability to continue to produce and sell products that generate a significant portion of our sales and profits for example changes in packaging laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs in addition changes in legislation imposing tariffs on or restricting the importation of our products or raw materials required to make our products restricting the sale of kcup pods requiring compostability of kcup pods limiting the ability of consumers to put kcup pods into municipal waste or recycling streams could at least for some period of time cut off a significant source of our sales and profits changes in bottle deposit and recycling laws including requiring manufacturers of kcup pods to pay responsible producer or other fees to either governmental or nongovernmental entities in connection with the collection recycling or disposition of kcup pods which may support our corporate responsibility objectives and goals but could increase our costs 

we depend on key information systems and thirdparty service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on thirdparty providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting collecting storing and transmitting our primary data center and processing various accounting and transactional services an offshore shared service center managed by third parties provides lower cost services to conduct our business including a number of accounting tax and computing functions if any of these thirdparty service providers or vendors do not perform effectively or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations in addition the management of multiple thirdparty service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control 

our information systems contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

in addition because we primarily accept debit and credit cards for payment in our ecommerce channel we are subject to the pci standard issued by the payment card industry security standards council the pci standard contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of cardholder data we are in compliance with the pci standard however complying with the pci standard and implementing related procedures technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or the maintenance and support of existing systems and technology to maintain compliance with the pci standard could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations further even though we are compliant with the pci standard we still may not be able to prevent security breaches any material interruptions or failures in our paymentrelated systems could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

in addition some of our commercial partners may receive or store information provided by us or our users through their websites including information entrusted to them by customers if we or these thirdparty commercial partners fail to adopt or adhere to adequate information security practices or fail to comply with their respective online policies or in the event of a breach of our networks our users’ data and customer information may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase our information systems and those of our third party service providers have been and may in the future be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information disrupting business processes or corrupting information these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets litigation regulatory actions or investigations remediation costs damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event which could adversely affect our business 

our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us 

we use information technology and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities including supporting critical business operations communicating with our suppliers customers and employees maintaining financial information and effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services to conduct our business including a number of accounting internal control human resources and computing functions 

continuity of business applications and services has been and may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware our continuity of business applications and operations has been and may in the future be also disrupted by other cybersecurity attacks issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures denial of service telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic occurrences further cybersecurity breaches of our or third party systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking phishing attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached when risks such as these materialize the need for us to coordinate with various third party service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might make it more challenging to resolve the related issues additionally in the event of a cybersecurity breach confidential information that we process and maintain about our employees or consumers through our ecommerce platform could potentially be exposed if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our third party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results loss of intellectual property breach of confidential information and damage to our reputation or brands 

we continue to devote resources to network security backup and disaster recovery upgrading systems and networks enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data we are also in the process of enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment however security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis in addition due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident and the cost and operational expense of implementing maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly although we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of a breach or disruption such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses 

we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we have been and in the future may be a party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings that may include employment tort real estate antitrust environmental recyclingsustainability intellectual property commercial securities false advertising packaging product labeling consumer protection and other claims we have been and in the future may be a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling including under california’s “proposition 65” public statements and disclosures under securities laws antitrust advertising consumer protection and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts that are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we will base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost and any required actions arising out of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes and nonincomebased taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly andor annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law further tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate changes in tax laws regulations related interpretations and tax accounting standards in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may impact our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results 

failure to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results 

in many countries including the us we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned and are taxed accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed in the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to our positions we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of us foreign tax credits because the laws and regulations governing us foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment we cannot be sure that we will in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future

uncertainties and trends affecting our business 

we believe the north american beverage market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties refer to item 1a risk factors  as well as the uncertainties and trends affecting liquidity section below for more information about risks and uncertainties facing us 

some of these items such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its resulting impacts on the global economy including supply chain challenges and labor shortages have led to broadbased inflation in input costs logistics manufacturing and labor costs during the year ended december 31 2021 we have experienced supply chain disruptions and a significant inflationary impact compared to the prior year these challenges intensified during the later part of the year due to the surge in cases resulting from the omicron variant these impacts have created headwinds for our products that we expect to continue into 2022 

these inflationary pressures could impact our margins and operating results we along with our competitors have increased the pricing on a number of products in response to widespread inflation these pricing increases may result in future reductions in volume

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong net cash provided by operations was 2874 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2456 million for the prior year although there is continued uncertainty related to the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on our future results we believe we are uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio and unmatched distribution network to successfully navigate through this pandemic and the steps we have taken over the course of the pandemic to strengthen our balance sheet leave us well positioned to manage our business we continue to manage all aspects of our business including but not limited to monitoring the financial health of our customers suppliers and other thirdparty relationships implementing gross margin enhancement strategies through our integration and productivity initiatives and developing new opportunities for growth such as innovation and agreements with partners to distribute brands that are accretive to our portfolio 

the following summarizes our cash activity for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

cash cash equivalents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents increased 313 million from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 primarily as a result of the proceeds from the sale of our bodyarmor investment and an increase in cash generated from our operations which outpaced deleveraging 

cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the us periodically as working capital funding requirements where allowed foreign cash balances were 216 million and 165 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

principal sources of capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated from our operations and borrowing capacity currently available under our kdp revolver and 2021 364day credit agreement additionally we have an uncommitted commercial paper program where we can issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary 

sources of liquidity  operations 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 418 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 driven by the increase in net income which includes the impact of the gain on the sale of our bodyarmor investment adjusted for noncash items and working capital 

cash conversion cycle 

our cash conversion cycle is defined as dio and dso less dpo the calculation of each component of the cash conversion cycle is provided below 



the following table summarizes our cash conversion cycle 



accounts payable program 

as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which include the extension of payment terms excluding our suppliers who require cash at date of purchase or sale our current payment terms with our suppliers generally range from 10 to 360 days we also enter into agreements with third party administrators to allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us and if voluntarily elected by the supplier sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted 

we have been informed by the third party administrators that as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020  3194 million and  2578 million respectively of our outstanding payment obligations were voluntarily elected by the supplier and sold to financial institutions the amounts settled through the program and paid to the financial institutions were 3331 million 2770 million and 1745 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

impact of the cares act 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 we deferred payments of employerrelated payroll taxes as allowed under the us coronavirus aid relief and economic security act commonly known as the cares act payment of at least 50 of the deferred amount was due by january 3 2022 with the remainder due by december 31 2022 we deferred a total of 59 million in such payments since the cares act was implemented and we timely paid approximately 30 million as of january 3 2022 

sources of liquidity  financing 

in march 2021 we undertook a strategic refinancing and issued 2150 million aggregate face value of notes consisting of 1150 million aggregate principal amount of 0750 2024 notes 500 million aggregate principal amount of 2250 2031 notes and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 3350 2051 notes the proceeds from the issuance were used to voluntarily prepay several tranches of our existing notes and our 2019 kdp term loan in order to benefit from current market conditions to refinance our debt maturities at more attractive interest rates while also extending the duration of our debt we also terminated our 2020 364day credit agreement which would have expired in april 2021 and replaced it with our 2021 364day credit agreement which has a termout option allowing us to extend the maturity date by converting the facility into a term loan agreement for an additional oneyear term 

additionally in march 2021 we filed a prospectus supplement with the sec in order to sell up to 4300000 shares to or through goldman in atthemarket offerings known as an atm program the atm program was completed effective march 15 2021 and the net proceeds of approximately  140 million were primarily used to cover our obligation to remit cash to local state and federal tax authorities in connection with the net settlement of vesting restricted stock units during the first quarter of 2021 commissions and fees paid under the atm program were less than 1 million for the year ended december 31 2021 

refer to note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for managements discussion of our financing arrangements 

we also have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec on august 27 2019 which allows us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock preferred stock debt securities and warrants from time to time in one or more offerings at the direction of our board of directors 

debt ratings 

as of december 31 2021 our credit ratings were as follows 



these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations 

as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and we have no reason to believe that we will be unable to satisfy these covenants 

libor considerations 

in 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that libor will no longer be published after 2021 in the us the alternative reference rates committee selected the secured overnight financing rate as the preferred alternative reference rate to libor in december 2020 it was announced that certain libor tenors will continue to be published through june 30 2023 

we have a number of financing arrangements which incorporate libor as a benchmark rate and which extend past 2021 the agreements related to such financing arrangements use libor tenors which will continue to be published through june 30 2023 additionally these agreements contain provisions for alternative reference rates we do not expect a significant change to our cost of debt as a result of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate 

principal uses of capital resources 

through 2021 our principal uses of our capital resources following the dps merger were deleveraging providing shareholder return to our investors through regular quarterly dividends and investing in kdp to capture market share and drive growth through innovation and routes to market 

beginning in 2022 now that we have met our postmerger goals we will look to invest in inorganic value creation through ma including portfolio expansion distribution scale geographic expansion and new capabilities in addition to ma we may consider share repurchases and special dividends to our investors our board of directors authorized a fouryear share repurchase program of up to 4 billion of our outstanding common stock beginning on january 1 2022 potentially enabling us to return value to shareholders see expansion of our capital allocation strategy below 

deleveraging and other debt repayments 

in 2018 management set deleveraging targets for a 23 year time period following the dps merger in order to optimize our balance sheet since the dps merger we have made net repayments of 4896 million of our notes our commercial paper and our other credit agreements including 1721 million for the year ended december 31 2021 these amounts include a makewhole premium paid during the year ended december 31 2021 of 95 million 

in may 2021 our 2021 merger notes were repaid at maturity using cash generated from operations and the issuance of commercial paper 

regular quarterly dividends 

in february 2021 we announced that our board of directors approved a 25 increase in our annualized dividend rate to 075 per share from the current annualized rate of 060 per share effective with the company’s regular quarterly dividend for the second quarter of 2021 for the year ended december 31 2021 we have declared total dividends of 07125 per share 

capital expenditures 

we have significantly invested in stateoftheart manufacturing and warehousing facilities including expansive investments in new facilities in newbridge ireland spartanburg south carolina and allentown pennsylvania in order to optimize our supply chain network through integration and productivity projects and to mitigate risk of business interruption 

purchases of property plant and equipment were  423 million  461 million and  330 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

capital expenditures which includes both purchases of property plant and equipment and amounts included in accounts payable and accrued expenses for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 primarily related to our continued investment in stateoftheart manufacturing and warehousing facilities capital expenditures included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were  189 million  280 million and  163 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively which primarily related to these investments 

as we begin to move past the threeyear period after the dps merger we expect that purchases of property plant and equipment will be approximately 3 of net sales on an annualized basis 

purchases of intangible assets 

we have invested in the expansion of our dsd network through transactions with strategic independent bottlers to ensure competitive distribution scale for our brands these transactions are generally accounted for as an asset acquisition as the majority of the transaction price represents the cost to reacquire our distribution rights purchases of intangible assets were  32 million  56 million and  35 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

expansion of our capital allocation strategy 

beginning on january 1 2022 we intend to expand our capital allocation strategy to include inorganic options to drive total shareholder return strategic acquisitions are our primary inorganic option however to the extent our primary option does not occur we may employ secondary options which may include the repurchase of shares or special dividends see part ii item 5 for further information 

residual value guarantees 

we have a number of leasing arrangements and one licensing arrangement with special purpose entities associated with the same sponsor each one of these arrangements contain a residual value guarantee as of december 31 2021 we have not recorded any liabilities as it is not probable that we will have to make any payments required under the residual value guarantee refer to note 19 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the residual value guarantees 

uncertainties and trends affecting liquidity and capital resources 

disruptions in financial and credit markets including those caused by the ongoing covid19 pandemic may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials 

customer and consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by the risk factors discussed under risk factors in part 1 item 1a of our annual report as well as subsequent filings with the sec that could have a material effect on production delivery and consumption of our products which could result in a reduction in our sales volume 

we believe that the following events trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity 

• our ability to either repay existing debt maturities through cash flow from operations or refinance through future issuances of senior unsecured notes 

• our ability to access andor renew our committed financing arrangements  

• a significant downgrade in our credit ratings   could limit i our ability to issue debt at terms that are favorable to us or ii a financial institutions willingness to participate in our accounts payable program and reduce the attractiveness of the accounts payable program to participating suppliers who may sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions which could impact our accounts payable program 

• our continued payment of regular quarterly dividends 

• our continued capital expenditures 

• seasonality of our operating cash flows which could impact shortterm liquidity 

• our ability to issue unsecured uncommitted commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 2400 million 

• future mergers or acquisitions which may include brand ownership companies regional bottling companies distributors andor distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage 

• future opportunistic repurchases of our common stock or special dividends to drive total shareholder return 

• future equity investments and 

• fluctuations in our tax obligations 

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 

goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 

we conduct tests for impairment of our goodwill and our other indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination and we also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units 

effective january 1 2021 we modified our internal reporting and operating segments to reflect changes in the executive leadership team to further enhance speedtomarket and decision effectiveness although this did not change our reportable segments our reporting units and operating segments were redefined for 2021 we defined our six reporting units as the following 



for both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of either the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is not more likely than not less than its carrying value also known as a step 0 analysis if a quantitative analysis is required the following would be required 

• the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is recorded 

• the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges 

for the year ended december 31 2021 we performed a quantitative analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite lived brand assets whereby we used an income approach or in some cases a combination of income and market based approaches to determine the fair value of our assets as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and enterprise value we performed a qualitative step 0 analysis for other indefinite lived intangible assets including trade names contractual arrangements and distribution rights these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various risks discussed in item 1a risk factors  in this annual report on form 10k 

critical assumptions for quantitative analyses include revenue growth and profit performance including the achievability of productivities over the next five year period as well as an appropriate discount rate and longterm growth rate as applicable discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt adjusted with various risk premiums longterm growth rates are based on the longterm inflation forecast industry growth and the longterm economic growth potential 

the following table provides the range of rates used in the analysis as of october 1 2021 



the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of december 31 2021 were 20182 million and 22553 million  respectively no impairment was identified for the years ended december 31 2021 or 2019 we recorded impairment of  67 million for the year ended december 31 2020 for bai an indefinite lived brand asset 

sensitivity analysis  discount rate 

for goodwill holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant including the revenue and profit performance assumption the effect of a 050 increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units as of october 1 2021 would not change our conclusion 

for the indefinitelived intangible assets holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant including the revenue and profit performance assumption the effect of a 050 increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our brands as of october 1 2021 would impact the amount of headroom over the carrying value of our brands as follows in millions 



sensitivity analysis  longterm growth rate 

for goodwill holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant including the discrete period revenue and profit performance assumptions as well as the discount rates the effect of a 050 decrease in the longterm growth rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units as of october 1 2021 would not change our conclusion 

for the indefinitelived intangible assets holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant including the discrete period revenue and profit performance assumptions as well as the discount rates the effect of a 050 decrease in the longterm revenue growth rate used to determine the fair value of our brands as of october 1 2021 would impact the amount of headroom over the carrying value of our brands as follows in millions 



revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied accruals for customer incentives sales returns and marketing programs are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms volumebased metrics andor historical trends 

our customer incentives sales returns and marketing accrual methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding our contractual terms in order to estimate our customer participation and volume performance levels which impact the expense recognition our estimates are based primarily on a combination of known or historical transaction experiences differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized to earnings in the period differences are determined 

additionally judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a reduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense which is a component of our sga expenses 

a 10 change in the accrual for our customer incentives sales returns and marketing programs would have affected our income from operations by 53 million for the year ended december 31 2021 

income taxes 

we establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following 

• the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained 

• the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained but for a lesser amount or 

• the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 

our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions as these audits progress events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 

we also assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets primarily on historical earnings our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

if results differ from our assumptions a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate 

business combinations 

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill the fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques significant assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset if applicable 

if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill as discussed in the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets critical accounting estimate section above

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap we have presented for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 i adjusted income from operations ii adjusted interest expense iii adjusted provision for income taxes iv adjusted net income attributable to kdp v adjusted diluted eps vi adjusted gross margin vii adjusted operating margin and viii adjusted effective tax rate which are considered nongaap financial measures the nongaap financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for results prepared in accordance with us gaap the nongaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures in the same way as we do the adjusted measures are not substitutes for their comparable us gaap financial measures such as income from operations net income diluted eps or other measures prescribed by us gaap and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures 

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we define our adjusted nongaap financial measures as certain financial statement captions and metrics adjusted for certain items affecting comparability the items affecting comparability are defined below 

items affecting comparability 

defined as certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior years adjusted for the tax impact as applicable tax impact is determined based upon an approximate rate for each item for each period management adjusts for i the unrealized marktomarket impact of derivative instruments not designated as hedges in accordance with us gaap and do not have an offsetting risk reflected within the financial results as well as the unrealized marktomarket impact of our vita coco investment ii the amortization associated with definitelived intangible assets iii the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the dps merger iv the amortization of the fair value adjustment of the senior unsecured notes obtained as a result of the dps merger v stock compensation expense and the associated windfall tax benefit attributable to the matching awards made to employees who made an initial investment in kdp vi noncash changes in deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of tax rate or apportionment changes and vii other certain items that are excluded for comparison purposes to prior years 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the other certain items excluded for comparison purposes include i restructuring and integration expenses related to significant business combinations ii productivity expenses iii costs related to significant nonroutine legal matters iv the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of debt v incremental costs to our operations related to risks associated with the covid19 pandemic vi gains from insurance recoveries related to the february 2019 organized malware attack on our business operation networks in the coffee systems segment vii the gain on the sale of our investment in bodyarmor viii impairment recognized on our equity method investment with bedford as a result of funding our share of their winddown costs and ix transaction costs for significant business combinations completed or abandoned

costs related to significant nonroutine legal matters relate to the antitrust litigation incremental costs to our operations related to risks associated with the covid19 pandemic include incremental expenses incurred to either maintain the health and safety of our frontline employees or temporarily increase compensation to such employees to ensure essential operations continue during the pandemic 

we believe removing these costs reflects how management views our business results on a consistent basis see impact of covid19 on our financial statements for further information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices from time to time we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge or mitigate commercial risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation investing or trading refer to note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our derivative instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars however we have exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the euro against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred as of december 31 2021 the impact to our income from operations of a 10 swing up or down in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 48 million on an annual basis 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2021 we had derivative contracts outstanding with notional values of 848 million maturing at various dates through september 25 2024 

interest rate risk 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio through the use of interest rate contracts and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as of december 31 2021 the carrying value of our fixedrate debt excluding lease obligations was 11733 million and our variablerate debt was 149 million comprised entirely of commercial paper additionally as of december 31 2021 the total notional value of receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps was 400 million our variablerate instruments are generally based on libor and a credit spread 

we estimate that the potential impact to our interest rate expense associated with variable rate debt and derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical interest rate change of 1 based on variablerate debt and derivative instrument levels as of december 31 2021 would be an increase of approximately 5 million or decrease of approximately 1 million our estimate of the annual impact to interest expense reflects our assumption that libor will not fall below 0 

commodity risk 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of coffee beans pet aluminum diesel fuel corn for high fructose corn syrup apple juice concentrate sucrose and natural gas for use in processing and packaging 

we utilize commodities derivative instruments and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities as of december 31 2021 we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 529 million maturing at various dates through november 28 2023 the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2021 was a net asset of 106 million 

as of december 31 2021 the impact of a 10 change up or down in market prices for these commodities where the risk of movements has not been hedged is estimated to have a 40 million impact to our income from operations for the year ended december 31 2022

the following represents a list of our major competitors 



although these companies offer competing brands in categories we participate in they are also our partners and customers as they purchase beverage concentrates or kcup pods directly from us 

our material resources 

our raw materials 

the principal raw materials we use in our business which we commonly refer to as ingredients and materials approximate 58 of our cost of sales and include green coffee pet bottles and caps including both virgin and recycled pet aluminum cans and ends sweeteners paper products kcup pod packaging materials fruit glass bottles and enclosures juices teas water and other ingredients we also use postconsumer recycled materials in the manufacturing of our single serve brewers the availability quality and costs of many of these materials have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time 

when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process and transportation to our customers through the use of various commodity derivative contracts or supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position 

ingredients and materials excluding green coffee  under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans and ends natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pods pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

s 

green coffee we purchase green coffee through outside brokers we also develop and pursue direct relationships with farms estates cooperatives and cooperative groups in order to support our broader traceability and sustainable supply chain initiatives during 2020 82 of our purchases of green coffee were responsibly sourced through third party sourcing programs and by the end of 2020 all coffee contracted to be received going forward is 100 responsibly sourced these purchases include a corresponding premium to recognize the effort required to achieve the sustainability standard and are traceable back to the exporter mill farm or group of farms we believe that traceability helps us manage social and environmental risk secure longterm supplies of highquality coffee and identify opportunities for supply chain investments 

energy costs in addition to ingredients and packaging costs we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs which can also fluctuate substantially due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution operations and the energy costs consumed in the production process the fuel costs associated with our distribution operations are reflected within our sga expenses 

our intellectual property

seasonality of our business 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our cold beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months while hot beverage sales are generally higher during the cooler months overall beverage sales can also be influenced by the timing of holidays and weather fluctuations sales of brewers and related accessories are generally higher during the second half of the year due to the holiday shopping season

sustainable packaging is a top priority for us and we continue to innovate for circular solutions across our portfolio we have set a goal to make 100 of our packaging recyclable or compostable by 2025 we also want to further contribute to the circular economy with our commitment to use 30 recycled material across our packaging portfolio by 2025 in the fourth quarter of 2020 we began transitioning our snapple and core brands to bottles made with 100 postconsumer recycled pet 

s 

already the majority of our bottles are recyclable and we are ensuring that our packaging materials are optimally designed to be the highest value possible for recycled plastic buyers which will increasingly include us to reduce contamination in the recycling stream we are replacing darkcolored plastics with clear plastic making our bottles labels and caps compatible with widelyused bottle recycling processes and supporting consumer education campaigns on how to recycle right we have also partnered with the american beverage association and other beverage industry leaders on the every bottle back initiative  a breakthrough effort to reduce our industry’s use of new plastic and increase the recycling and reuse of our pet bottles the initiative includes a 100 million industrybacked fund to invest in improved sorting processing and collection efforts that would increase the quality and availability of recycled plastic across the country 

in december 2020 we achieved our goal of making all kcup pods sold in the us recyclable by the end of 2020 having converted all kcup pods sold in canada to a recyclable format in 2018 the new pods are made of polypropylene 5 plastic a material that is accepted curbside for recycling by many communities and we have conducted extensive testing with municipal recycling facilities to validate that they can be effectively recycled we continue to engage with municipalities and recycling facilities to advance the quantity and quality of recycled polypropylene and have committed 10 million toward the advancement of polypropylene recycling in the us through the polypropylene recycling coalition an effort led by the recycling partnership and funded by leading brands recyclers converters and producers of polypropylene 

improving packaging solutions for product quality consumer use recoverability and reuse requires collaboration of all parties along the value chain using our strength in forming partnerships we collaborate closely with a number of stakeholders including industry groups nongovernmental organizations and investment firms to move our commitments beyond independent ambitions to collective action

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our operations 

widespread health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the ongoing covid19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic in countries where we operate or our customers and suppliers are located due to recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to close businesses limit travel avoid large gatherings or selfquarantine as well as temporary closures or decreased operations of the facilities of our customers distributors or suppliers these impacts include but are not limited to 

• significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products as a result of among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other restrictions store closures or financial hardship shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling or similar activity reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with the covid19 pandemic if prolonged such impacts could further increase the difficulty of operating our business during the pandemic including accurately planning and forecasting customer demand 

• inability to meet our consumers and customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or purchased finished goods logistics reduction or loss of workforce due to the insufficiency or failure of our safety protocols or other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• failure of third parties including those located in international locations on which we rely including our suppliers bottlers distributors contract manufacturers thirdparty service providers contractors commercial banks and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or to timely meet those obligations or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties or 

• significant changes in the conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to perform necessary business functions restrict or prevent consumers from having access to our products or otherwise prevent our thirdparty bottlers distributors partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products 

s 

all of these impacts could place limitations on our ability to execute on our business plan and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we continue to monitor the situation have actively implemented policies and procedures to address the situation and as the pandemic continues to further unfold we may adjust our current policies and procedures as regulations or governmental orders are implemented or more information and guidance become available the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a of our annual report any of which could have a material effect on us this situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently 

we operate in intensely competitive categories 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences some of our competitors such as cocacola pepsico the kraft heinz company and nestlé sa are multinational corporations with significant financial resources these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products changing their route to market reducing prices or increasing promotional activities we also compete with a number of smaller brands and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

our sales may be negatively affected by numerous factors including our inability to maintain or increase prices our inability to effectively promote our products ineffective advertising and marketing campaigns new entrants into the market the decision of wholesalers retailers or consumers to purchase competitors products instead of ours and increased marketing costs and instore placement and slotting fees due to our competitors willingness to spend aggressively competitive pressures may also cause us to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our ability to increase such prices in addition the rapid growth of ecommerce may create additional consumer price deflation by among other things facilitating comparison shopping and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy routetomarket strategies and thus negatively affect revenues 

a significant percentage of the coffee systems segments financial performance is attributable to sales of kcup pods for use with keurig brewing systems we compete for sales of kcup pods against local and regional brands as well as against private label brands developed by retailers our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the countries in which we operate or in various local marketplaces or maintain or enhance our relationships with our partners and customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors including as a result of increased consolidation in the food and beverage industry and a significant increase in the number of competitive pod contract manufacturers 

continued acceptance of keurig brewers and sales of kcup pods to an increasing installed customer base are significant factors in our coffee systems growth plans any substantial or sustained decline in the sale of keurig brewers failure to continue to reduce the cost of keurig brewers or substantial or sustained decline in the sales of kcup pods could materially and adversely affect our business keurig brewers compete against all sellers and types of coffeemakers if we do not succeed in continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing keurig brewers or differentiating keurig brewers from our competitors in the coffeemaker category based on technology quality of products desired brands or otherwise or our competitors adopt their respective strategies our competitive position may be weakened 

costs and supply for commodities such as raw materials and energy may change substantially and shortages may occur 

our raw materials are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base and their cost can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs price increases for our raw materials could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers furthermore any price increases passed along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance furthermore price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for marktomarket changes in the derivative instruments 

our principal raw materials in our hot business include coffee beans and kcup pod raw materials including cups filter paper and other ingredients used in the manufacturing of our kcup pods we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean coffee and related coffee products the quality of the coffee we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price of coffee this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price increase the price of highquality coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts 

s 

the supply and price of crop commodities we purchase such as coffee apples and corn can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease such as coffee rust general cost increases in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of various commodities through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting supplies 

speculative trading in commodities can also influence prices if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of our commodities due to any of the factors described herein or a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our products which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we also have a limited number of suppliers for certain strategic raw materials critical to our operations we may have limited negotiation leverage with regards to these suppliers which could negatively affect our operations and the financial performance of our business in addition in order to ensure a continuous supply of highquality raw materials some of our inventory purchase obligations include longterm purchase commitments for certain strategic raw materials the timing of these may not always coincide with the period in which we need the supplies to fulfill customer demand this could lead to higher and more variable inventory levels andor higher raw material costs for us 

if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability cybersecurity attacks and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business and therefore may be significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution business and our use of thirdparty carriers additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas 

product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products including beverage products and our brewers we have various quality environmental health and safety supply chain standards a failure or perceived failure to meet our quality or safety standards including product contamination or tampering or allegations of mislabeling whether actual or perceived could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers manufacturers distributors or suppliers this could result in time consuming and expensive production interruptions recalls market withdrawals product liability claims and negative publicity it could also result in the destruction of product inventory lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time fines from applicable regulatory agencies and higherthananticipated rates of warranty returns and other returns of goods moreover negative publicity also could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls 

any or all of these events may lead to a loss of consumer confidence and trust could damage the goodwill associated with our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products and could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and shopping behavior which could impact our financial results 

consumers’ preferences continually evolve due to a variety of factors including changing demographics of the population social trends changes in consumer lifestyles and consumption patterns concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of products concerns regarding the location of origin or source of ingredients and products changes in consumers spending habits negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds and the use of natural organic or simple ingredients in beverages the demand for csds has therefore decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs such as water readytodrink coffee and teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate and respond to these trends and changing consumer beverage preferences our sales and growth could suffer 

consumers are also increasingly focused on sustainability with particular attention to the recyclability of product packaging reducing consumption of singleuse plastics and nonrecyclable materials and the environmental impact of manufacturing operations if we do not meet consumer demands by providing recyclable packaging options and focusing on sustainability throughout our manufacturing operations our sales could suffer 

in addition consumer shopping behavior is rapidly evolving due to both changes in travel vacation and leisure activity patterns and the acceleration of ecommerce and other methods of purchasing products if we are unable to meet the consumer where and when they desire their products or if we are unable to respond to changes in distribution channels including ecommerce our financial results could be adversely impacted 

s 

if we do not innovate rapidly and successfully to respond to shifting consumer demands our business may suffer achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating results 

if we do not successfully manage our investments in new business strategies or integrate and manage our acquired businesses or brands our operating results may adversely be affected 

from time to time we expect to acquire businesses or brands invest in emerging companies andor form joint ventures and enter into various licensing and distribution agreements to expand our product portfolio in evaluating such endeavors we will be required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business strategies opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and cost of potential liabilities furthermore we may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with any such transaction including in connection with the integration or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures we may also experience delays in extending our respective internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in our financial records and in our consolidated financial statements additionally new ventures and investments are inherently risky and may not be successful and we may face challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from such investments or ventures any acquisitions investments or ventures may also result in the diversion of management attention and resources from other initiatives and operations 

our financial performance will depend in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands and the success of our other investments and ventures we may not achieve the strategic and financial objectives for such transactions if we are unable to achieve such objectives our consolidated results could be negatively affected 

substantial disruption at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at the facilities of our suppliers bottlers contract manufacturers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease epidemics strikes transportation or supply interruption contractual dispute government regulation cybersecurity attacks or terrorism moreover if demand increases more than we forecast we will need to either expand our capabilities internally or acquire additional capacity alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more than existing facilities or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have programs to invest and upgrade our manufacturing distribution and other facilities including expansive investments in new manufacturing facilities in spartanburg south carolina newbridge ireland and allentown pennsylvania we may continue to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones additionally we rely on third parties for the construction and renovation of our facilities and manufacturing of our production equipment if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities or third parties fail to complete the construction or renovation of facilities or production equipment in a timely manner or in accordance with our specifications our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend against claims we cannot be certain that the steps taken to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries third parties own certain trademarks or other intellectual property that we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola outside north america adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could also negatively impact our brands 

s 

in some cases we license rights to distribute thirdparty products the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience union activity including labor disputes or work stoppages 

approximately 8000 of our employees worldwide are covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in labor disputes strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing renewed or expanded agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

risks related to our financial performance 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

as of december 31 2020 we had 49779 million of total assets of which 20184 million were goodwill and 23968 million were other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinitelived intangible assets in connection with brands trade names acquired technology customer relationships and contractual arrangements we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances some of which are beyond our control factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products andor the product category resulting in diminished longterm revenue growth ii higher commodity or transportation prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition iv not achieving forecasted synergies from the dps merger v significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and vi changes in our discount rates which could change due to factors such as movement in risk free interest rates changes in general market interest rate and market beta volatility and changes to managements view of forecast risk among others since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate 

we have incurred significant indebtedness which could adversely affect us including decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense 

we have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect us including decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense the increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels if our financial performance does not meet current expectations our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

additionally in assessing our credit strength credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as our results of operations and financial position at the time if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength the credit agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our current or future results of operations and financial position or for any other reason our cost of borrowing could increase furthermore a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could limit a financial institutions willingness to participate in our accounts payable program and reduce the attractiveness of the accounts payable program to participating suppliers who may sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions in addition a significant downgrade in our credit ratings may reduce flexibility of our business to engage in certain transactions such as the execution and renewal of certain leases 

moreover in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures the repayment or refinancing of its indebtedness acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

s 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and may affect our ability to operate our business 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict our ability including certain subsidiaries to incur debt and our ability including certain subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions our ability including certain subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 

optimizing our operations following the dps merger may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the dps merger may not be realized 

we continue to optimize our operations as one kdp which is a complex costly and timeconsuming process the anticipated benefits of the dps merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the dps merger 

we are also incurring costs related to the optimization of our operations including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the optimization of our operations 

increases in our cost of employee benefits in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we will actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that it will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward cost pressure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

risks relating to our relationships with third parties 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices and more favorable trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or trade terms that are favorable to retailers our respective margins would be reduced retailers also have leverage to require us to provide increased marketing and promotional expenditures including larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our partners including bottlers distributors and licensees do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer in addition certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products’ retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands accordingly the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers 

if we are unable to offer terms that are acceptable to our significant customers or such customers determine that they need fewer inventories to service consumers these customers could reduce purchases of our products or may increase purchases of products from competitors which would harm our sales and profitability furthermore the loss of sales from a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we depend on thirdparty bottling and distribution companies for a significant portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to thirdparty bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segment’s operations generate a significant portion of our overall income from operations some of these bottlers are also our direct competitors or also bottle and distribute products for our competitors the majority of these bottlers’ business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors’ products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors’ products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products prioritize their own products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories to protect our route to market and may not be able to pass price increases through to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond their control and their business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of thirdparty bottlers 

s 

failure to maintain strategic relationships with brand owners and private label brands could adversely impact our future growth and business potentially resulting in the termination of those agreements 

in our coffee systems segment we have entered into strategic relationships for the manufacturing distribution and sale of kcup pods with partner customers as well as with retailers for their private label brands as independent companies our strategic partners make their own business decisions which may not align with our interests if we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our strategic partners through a combination of premium performance and service pricing and marketing and advertising support or if these strategic partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and technological or other development efforts they may take actions that adversely impact us including entering into agreements with competing pod contract manufacturers or vertically integrating to manufacture their own kcup pods increasing competition among kcup pod manufacturers and moving to vertical integration may result in price compression which could have an adverse effect on our gross margins the loss of strategic partners could also adversely impact our future profitability and growth awareness of keurig brewers our ability to attract additional branded or private label parties to do business with us or our ability to attract new consumers to buy keurig brewers 

in our packaged beverages segment we have entered into strategic relationships for the manufacture andor distribution of products from partner brand owners in emerging or fastgrowing segments in which we may not currently have a brand presence we are subject to a risk of our partner brands terminating their agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance within each distribution agreement we have certain protections in case the partner brands terminate their agreements such as a onetime termination payment 

we rely on the performance of a limited number of suppliers manufacturers and order fulfillment companies for our brewers 

a small number of companies manufacture the vast majority of our brewers with a majority of the brewers we sell procured from one thirdparty brewer manufacturer if these manufacturers are not able to scale their manufacturing operations to match increasing consumer demand for our brewers at competitive costs our overall results will be negatively affected our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers also exposes us to increased risk that certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals that are contained in our brewers have originated from covered countries as defined in section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 but cannot be determined to be conflict free as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

risk relating to our capital structure 

we no longer meet the requirements to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of nasdaq and the rules of the sec however even though we are no longer a controlled company we will continue to qualify for and may rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to stockholders of other companies during a oneyear transition period 

on august 19 2020 maple holdings bv an affiliate of jab completed the sale of 45 million shares of kdp stock in a public secondary offering on september 8 2020 jab distributed an additional 76 million shares of kdp stock to its minority partners on november 19 2020 maple holdings bv completed the sale of an additional 20 million shares of kdp stock in a public secondary offering as a result of these transactions jab and its affiliates now own approximately 34 of kdps common stock and we are no longer a “controlled company” as defined in the nasdaq rules however even though we are not a controlled company we will continue to qualify for and may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to stockholders of other companies during a oneyear transition period the nasdaq rules require that our board be composed of a majority of independent directors as defined under the rules of such exchange by august 19 2021 and that our remuneration and nomination committee consist entirely of independent directors by august 19 2021 

during these transition periods we may continue to utilize the available exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to stockholders of other companies as permitted by the nasdaq rules if we fail to meet the above deadlines for these requirements our common stock could be delisted from nasdaq which would negatively impact the trading of our common shares and our business and financial condition 

s 

general risk factors 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us canada mexico the caribbean or other geographies where we do business may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings we may be impacted by consumer price sensitivity associated with many of our products similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to supply materials timely additionally these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we also face counterparty risk for our cash investments and derivative instruments declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity due to impacts on our suppliers customers and operating costs 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements 

financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face including their ability to access working capital could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them the timing of settlement for our obligation to the supplier or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers and to the extent these difficulties impact the timing of settlement for our obligation to the supplier we may have a decrease in our cash flow from operations and may have to use our various financing arrangements for shortterm liquidity needs 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results 

while our operations are predominately in the us we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales expenses profits assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso the canadian dollar and the euro as well as other foreign currencies in which we transact business we may continue to hedge a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing derivative instruments for certain transactions however we are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations 

as a result our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates moreover any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit gross margin and income from operations from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year 

we continue to be exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that we may not be able to manage through derivative instruments and may incur material losses from such transactions utilizing derivative instruments 

weather natural disasters water availability and climate change or related legislation could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather natural disasters or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel our ability to produce and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months or unusually warm weather during the winter months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

global climate change poses a serious threat to communities businesses farmers and ecosystems across the world climate change is already affecting the agricultural sector and disruptions to crop growing conditions are expected to increase with extreme weather events increasing temperatures and changing water availability water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

s 

we are also faced with the impact of disruptions to crop growing conditions as a result of changing weather patterns which can cause changes in geographical ranges of crops as well as weeds diseases and pests that affect those crops these impacts may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities such as coffee corn and tea which are important sources of ingredients for our products 

concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we will operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging including kcup pods and the disposal of kcup pods cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

us and international laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

our products are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we conduct business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety sourcing labeling storing transportation marketing advertising distribution and sale of our products other laws and regulations that may impact our business relate to the environment relations with distributors and retailers employment privacy health and trade practices our expanding international business will also expose us to economic factors regulatory requirements increasing competition and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries our international business is also subject to us laws regulations and policies including anticorruption and export laws and regulations 

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacturing safety sourcing labeling storing transportation advertising distribution and sale of our products could damage our reputation andor result in criminal civil or administrative actions with substantial financial penalties and operational limitations in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures or significant challenges to our ability to continue to produce and sell products that generate a significant portion of our sales and profits for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs in addition changes in legislation imposing tariffs on or restricting the importation of our products or raw materials required to make our products restricting the sale of kcup pods requiring compostability of kcup pods limiting the ability of consumers to put kcup pods into municipal waste or recycling streams or requiring manufacturers of kcup pods to pay responsible producer or other fees to local or other governmental entities in connection with the collection recycling or disposition of kcup pods could increase costs for us or at least for some period of time cut off a significant source of our sales and profits regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products such as california’s “proposition 65” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects are or could become applicable to our products 

we depend on key information systems and thirdparty service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on thirdparty providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting collecting storing and transmitting our primary data center and processing various accounting and transactional services an offshore shared service center managed by third parties provides lower cost services to conduct our business including a number of accounting tax and computing functions if any of these thirdparty service providers or vendors do not perform effectively or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations in addition the management of multiple thirdparty service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control 

our information systems contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

s 

in addition because we primarily accept debit and credit cards for payment in our ecommerce channel we are subject to the pci standard issued by the payment card industry security standards council the pci standard contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of cardholder data we are not fully compliant with the pci standard and there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to operate our facilities and our customer service and sales operations in accordance with the pci standard or other industry recommended or contractually required practices we are in the process to be in compliance with the pci standard however complying with the pci standard and implementing related procedures technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to achieve compliance with the pci standard or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations even if we are compliant with pci standard we still may not be able to prevent security breaches any material interruptions or failures in our paymentrelated systems could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

in addition some of our commercial partners may receive or store information provided by us or our users through their websites including information entrusted to them by customers if we or these thirdparty commercial partners fail to adopt or adhere to adequate information security practices or fail to comply with their respective online policies or in the event of a breach of our networks our users’ data and customer information may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information disrupting business processes or corrupting information these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets litigation regulatory actions or investigations remediation costs damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event which could adversely affect our business 

our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us 

we use information technology and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities including supporting critical business operations communicating with our suppliers customers and employees maintaining financial information and effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services to conduct our business including a number of accounting internal control human resources and computing functions 

continuity of business applications and services has been and may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware our continuity of business applications and operations has been and may in the future be also disrupted by other cybersecurity attacks issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures denial of service telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic occurrences further cybersecurity breaches of our or third party systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking phishing attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached when risks such as these materialize the need for us to coordinate with various third party service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might make it more challenging to resolve the related issues additionally in the event of a cybersecurity breach of confidential information that we process and maintain about our employees or consumers through our ecommerce platform could be potentially exposed if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our third party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results loss of intellectual property breach of confidential information and damage to our reputation or brands 

we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery upgrading systems and networks enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data we are also in the process of enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment however security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis in addition due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident and the cost and operational expense of implementing maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly although we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of a breach or disruption such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses 

s 

we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our future success depends upon the continued contributions of senior management and other key personnel and the ability to retain and motivate them if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate the senior management team and other key personnel sufficiently to support the projected growth and initiatives of our business our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we may be a party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings that may include employment tort real estate antitrust environmental recyclingsustainability intellectual property commercial securities false advertising packaging product labeling consumer protection and other claims we may be a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling including under california’s “proposition 65” public statements and disclosures under securities laws antitrust advertising consumer protection and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts that are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we will base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost and any required actions arising out of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes and nonincomebased taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly andor annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law in addition tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate among other things a number of countries are considering changes to their tax laws applicable to multinational corporate groups such as the tcja some foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the tcja that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and operating results moreover many of the new provisions of the tcja will need to be implemented through us department of treasury regulations and other guidance that could impact the interpretation and effect of these provisions the recent presidential election may additionally impact our effective tax rate as the new administration may seek to change the statutory rate and associated tax laws changes in tax laws regulations related interpretations and tax accounting standards in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our financial results 

failure to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results 

in many countries including the us we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned and are taxed accordingly although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed in the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to our positions we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of us foreign tax credits because the laws and regulations governing us foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment we cannot be sure that we will in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future

uncertainties and trends affecting our business 

we believe the north american beverage market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties some of these items such as the ongoing outbreak of covid19 changes in consumer preferences and macroeconomic changes have previously created and may continue to create category headwinds for a number of our products refer to item 1a risk factors combined with the uncertainties and trends affecting liquidity section below for more information about the risks and uncertainties we face 

covid19 pandemic disclosures 

our first priority always is to keep our employees safe and healthy we have taken extraordinary precautions to do this and to provide the support our employees and their families may need during this unprecedented time 

we continue to deliver for our customers and consumers working hard to fulfill strong demand we are finding innovative ways to quickly adapt to changes in shopping behaviors with the vast majority of north america impacted by a mix of occupancy limitations stayathome or shelterinplace orders and closures of nonessential businesses 

we are also focused on providing for our communities by supporting frontline healthcare workers who are fighting this crisis day in and day out we don’t make masks or medical equipment at our company but we do make beverages and through our fueling the frontline program we donated keurig brewers coffee and other beverages to hospitals in need as our way to say thank you for the unwavering commitment and courage of the entire medical community 

the covid19 pandemic has had divergent impacts within our business for example we experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of our products in our athome business caused in part by changing consumer habits in response to covid19 contributing to increases in net sales at the same time we experienced significant declines in net sales in our awayfromhome business due to office closures and the slowdown of hospitality and fountain foodservice as a result of shelterinplace guidelines and restaurant capacity limits in the future the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic including higher levels of unemployment lower wages or a recessionary environment may result in reduced demand for our products it could also lead to volatility in demand due to government actions such as shelterinplace notices in response to increases in reported cases and hospitalizations in certain regions these government actions could impact consumers movements and access to our products 

while we believe that there will continue to be strong longterm demand for our products the timing and extent of economic recovery and the uncertainties in shortterm demand trends make it difficult to predict the overall effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business we expect that there will be heightened volatility in net sales during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic that may impact interim periods 

our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our critical frontline employees and our supply chain as food and agriculture is deemed part of the critical infrastructure by the department of homeland security our frontline employees have been identified as critical workers in maintaining the us food and beverage supply as a result we have strived to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees with particular measures in place for those working in our manufacturing and distribution facilities which also included temporary incentive pay programs and benefits we intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures however disruptions to our supply chain measures taken to protect employees increased absenteeism or other local effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted and could continue to impact our operations for our corporate employees we do not believe that the remote work environment has had any significant impact on our internal controls over financial reporting with the health and safety of our employees remaining our top priority we are diligently working on plans to safely bring our employees back to office locations with enhanced safety and health protocols we do not believe these plans will impact our nearterm liquidity needs 

the covid19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity position we continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our shortterm liquidity needs and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our debt ratings refer to uncertainties and trends affecting liquidity within the liquidity and capital resources section below for more information 

executive summary 

impact of covid19 on our financial statements 

the impact of covid19 on our net sales performance presented both headwinds and tailwinds across the business and within the segments requiring strong portfolio package and channel mix management to optimize overall performance the diversity of the company’s broad portfolio and extensive route to market network enabled us to successfully navigate these mix impacts posed by the covid19 pandemic to drive overall performance 

• coffee systems experienced growth in kcup coffee pods for athome consumption and strong doubledigit growth in brewers which more than offset the significant decline in awayfromhome consumption due to weaknesses in the office coffee channel as many companies shifted to a workfromhome model during 2020 sales in the ecommerce channel were very strong as consumers shifted purchases to the online channel including at the keurigcom retail site 

• packaged beverages experienced a net benefit from strong inmarket execution driven by net sales and market share growth in the majority of the segments beverage portfolio performance in largeformat channels continued to be strong across multipack and takehome packages which was partially offset by softness in the convenience and gas channels due to decreased consumer mobility 

• beverage concentrates experienced a significant decline in net sales due to the fountain foodservice component of the business which services restaurants and hospitality as a result of the impact of shutdowns and reductions in occupant capacity which improved throughout the year reflecting a modest reopening of quickserve and other fastcasual restaurants 

• latin america beverages experienced limited growth in sales volumes driven by reduced consumer mobility and tourism in mexico 

the current environment has increased operating costs requiring us to take deliberate action in addition to strong portfolio package and channel mix management to optimize overall net sales performance we maintained our strong cost discipline which included the following 

• reduced marketing expense given the current covid19 landscape which has impacted the effectiveness and return on marketing investments and 

• reduced other discretionary costs such as travel and entertainment expenses within our business 

as a result of these items covid19 impacted our results both positively and negatively and should be taken into account when reviewing this managements discussion and analysis refer to the section uncertainties and trends affecting our business  covid19 pandemic disclosures above for further information 

the following table sets forth our reconciliation of significant covid19related expenses employee compensation expense and employee protection costs which impact our sga expenses and cost of sales are included as the covid19 item affecting comparability and is excluded in our nongaap financial measures in addition reported amounts under us gaap also include additional costs not included in the covid19 item affecting comparability as presented in tables below 



1 employee compensation expense and employee protection costs are both included as the covid19 item affecting comparability in the reconciliation of our adjusted nongaap financial measures 

2 primarily reflects temporary incremental frontline incentive pay and the associated taxes in order to maintain essential operations during the covid19 pandemic impacts both cost of sales and sga expenses in midseptember 2020 we discontinued the incremental frontline incentive pay program 

3 includes costs associated with personal protective equipment temperature scans cleaning and other sanitization services impacts both cost of sales and sga expenses 

4 allowances reflect the expected impact of the economic uncertainty caused by covid19 leveraging estimates of credit worthiness default and recovery rates for certain of our customers impacts sga expenses 

5 inventory writedowns represent obsolescence charges which impact cost of sales

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong net cash provided by operations was 2456 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2474 million for the prior year although there is uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on our future results we believe we are uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio and unmatched distribution network to successfully navigate through this pandemic and the steps we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet leave us well positioned to manage our business as the crisis continues to unfold we continue to manage all aspects of our business including but not limited to monitoring the financial health of our customers suppliers and other thirdparty relationships implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth 

our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and our 39 billion borrowing capacity currently available under our existing kdp revolver and 2020 364day credit agreement additionally we have an uncommitted commercial paper program where we can issue up to 24 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis which provides us significant flexibility and shortterm liquidity we believe this level of liquidity enables us to more than meet our commitments even in a prolonged economic downturn as we continue to exercise financial discipline to ensure our longterm financial health refer to note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for managements discussion of these financing arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and we have no reason to believe that we will be unable to satisfy these covenants 

uncertainties and trends affecting liquidity 

disruptions in financial and credit markets including those caused by the ongoing covid19 pandemic may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials 

customer and consumer demand for our products may additionally be impacted by all risk factors discussed in item 1a risk factors that could have a material effect on production delivery and consumption of our products in the us mexico and the caribbean or canada which could result in a reduction in our sales volume similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials 

we believe that the following events trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity 

• our intention to drive significant cash flow generation to enable rapid deleveraging within two to three years from the dps merger 

• our ability to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 2400 million 

• our ability to access our other financing arrangements including the kdp revolver and the 2020 364day credit agreement which have availability of 3900 million as of december 31 2020 

• a significant downgrade in our credit ratings   could limit a financial institutions willingness to participate in our accounts payable program and reduce the attractiveness of the accounts payable program to participating suppliers who may sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions 

• our continued payment of dividends 

• our continued capital expenditures 

• future mergers or acquisitions of brand ownership companies regional bottling companies distributors andor distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage 

• future equity investments 

• seasonality of our operating cash flows which could impact shortterm liquidity and 

• fluctuations in our tax obligations 

libor considerations 

in 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that libor will no longer be published after 2021 in the us the alternative reference rates committee selected the secured overnight financing rate as the preferred alternative reference rate to libor in december 2020 it was announced that certain libor rates will continue to be published through june 30 2023 

we have a number of financing arrangements which incorporate libor as a benchmark rate and which extend past 2021 including the 2019 kdp term loan and the kdp revolver the agreements related to such financing arrangements contain provisions for alternative reference rates and we do not expect a significant change to our cost of debt as a result of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate 

liquidity 

based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary 

the following table summarizes our cash activity 



net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 18 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to year ended december 31 2019 driven by the decline in working capital and an increase in income tax payments partially offset by the increase in net income adjusted for noncash items 

as of december 31 2020 we had no deferred estimated tax payments as compared to deferred estimated tax payments as of december 31 2019 of 59 million which were paid in january 2020 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the rest of the year we deferred payments of employerrelated payroll taxes as allowed under the us coronavirus aid relief and economic security act commonly known as the cares act payment of at least 50 of the deferred amount is due on december 31 2021 with the remainder due by december 31 2022 as of december 31 2020 we have deferred a total of 59 million in such payments 

cash conversion cycle 

our cash conversion cycle is defined as dio and dso less dpo the calculation of each component of the cash conversion cycle is provided below 



our cash conversion cycle declined 17 days to approximately 63 days as of december 31 2020 as compared to 46 days as of december 31 2019 the following table summarizes our cash conversion cycle 



for the year ending december 31 2021 dpo is expected to have a positive impact on our cash conversion cycle as a result of our supplier terms initiative which has set our customary terms as we integrate our legacy businesses 

accounts payable program 

as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which include the extension of payment terms excluding our suppliers who require cash at date of purchase or sale our current payment terms with our suppliers generally range from 10 to 360 days we also entered into an agreement with a third party administrator to allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us and if voluntarily elected by the supplier sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted we have been informed by the third party administrator that as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 2578 million and 2097 million respectively of our outstanding payment obligations were voluntarily elected by the supplier and sold to financial institutions the amounts settled through the program and paid to the financial institutions were 2770 million and 1745 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

net cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by our purchases of property plant and equipment of 461 million and purchases of intangible assets of 56 million which was partially offset by proceeds of 203 million from sales of property plant and equipment primarily driven by our asset saleleaseback transactions 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by our purchases of property plant and equipment of 330 million partially offset by proceeds of 247 million from sales of property plant and equipment primarily driven by our asset saleleaseback transactions other drivers of cash used investing activities included 35 million for purchases of intangible assets primarily the reacquisition of distribution rights and advances of 32 million to bedford under its line of credit with us 

net cash used in financing activities 

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 consisted primarily of the net repayment of 1246 million for commercial paper notes we made the decision to repay commercial paper notes with an equivalent amount of borrowings under our kdp revolver as the costs and ability to issue commercial paper became inefficient at the onset of the covid19 pandemic versus borrowings under our kdp revolver the kdp revolver was subsequently repaid through the issuance of our 2030 notes and 2050 notes additionally we made voluntary and mandatory repayments on the term loan facility of 955 million dividend payments of 846 million the repayment of the 2020 notes of 250 million and net payments on structured payables of 170 million we also received 29 million from controlling shareholder stock transactions which related to the disgorgement of shortswing profits pursuant to section 16b of the exchange act 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 consisted primarily of the voluntary and mandatory repayments on the 2018 kdp term loan and 2019 kdp term loan of 1203 million dividend payments of 844 million repayments of structured payables of 531 million and the repayment of the 2019 notes of 250 million these cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by net issuance of commercial paper notes of 167 million and proceeds from structured payables of 330 million 

debt ratings 

as of december 31 2020 our credit ratings were as follows 



these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations 

capital expenditures 

purchases of property plant and equipment were 461 million and 330 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

capital expenditures which includes purchases of property plant and equipment and amounts reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily related to our continued investment in stateoftheart manufacturing facilities and equipment through the buildout of our spartanburg manufacturing facility the purchase of real estate in ireland and the associated build out of the manufacturing facility and the buildout of our allentown manufacturing facility 

capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily related to manufacturing equipment our continued investment in the construction of our new spartanburg facility in south carolina and information technology infrastructure 

cash cash equivalents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 

cash cash equivalents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents increased 144 million to 255 million as of december 31 2020 compared to 111 million as of december 31 2019 

our cash balances are used to fund working capital requirements scheduled debt and interest payments capital expenditures income tax obligations dividend payments and business combinations cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the us periodically as working capital funding requirements in those jurisdictions allow foreign cash balances were 165 million and 70 million as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively we accrue tax costs for repatriation as applicable as cash is generated in those foreign jurisdictions 

contractual commitments and obligations 

we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary refer to note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for obligations related to our senior unsecured notes and our kdp credit agreements refer to note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for future minimum lease commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 



1 amounts represent payments under agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including capital obligations and longterm contractual obligations 

amounts excluded from our table 

as of december 31 2020 we had 11 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits related interest and penalties classified as a longterm liability the table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment refer to note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension recognized as of december 31 2020 was approximately 25 million this amount is impacted by among other items funding levels plan amendments changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above the pension protection act of 2006 was enacted in august 2006 and established among other things new standards for funding of us defined benefit pension plans we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations we did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above 

we have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities we did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control 

in general we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are selfinsured for large portions of many different types of claims our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history as of december 31 2020 our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs totaled approximately 107 million 

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 

goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 

we conduct tests for impairment of our goodwill and our other indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination and we also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units 

we define our six reporting units as the following 



for both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of either the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is not more likely than not less than its carrying value also known as a step 0 analysis if a quantitative analysis is required the following would be required 

• the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is recorded 

• the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we performed a quantitative analysis whereby we used an income approach or in some cases a combination of income and market based approaches to determine the fair value of our assets as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and enterprise value these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various risks discussed in item 1a risk factors  in this annual report on form 10k 

critical assumptions for quantitative analyses include revenue growth and profit performance including the achievability of productivity and synergies over the next five year period as well as an appropriate discount rate long term growth rate and royalty rates as applicable discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt adjusted with various risk premiums long term growth rates are based on the longterm inflation forecast industry growth and the longterm economic growth potential royalty rates are based on observable market participant information 

the following table provides the range of rates used in the analysis as of october 1 2020 



the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of december 31 2020 were 20184 million and 22534 million  respectively during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recorded an impairment of  67 million for the indefinite lived brand asset of bai no other impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets was identified during the year ended december 31 2020 and no impairment was identified in each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

sensitivity analysis  discount rate 

for goodwill holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant including the revenue and profit performance assumption the effect of a 050 increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units as of october 1 2020 would not change our conclusion 

for the indefinitelived intangible assets holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant including the revenue and profit performance assumption the effect of a 050 increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our brands and trade names as of october 1 2020 would impact the amount of headroom over the carrying value of our brands and trade names as follows in millions 



1 the amounts listed in the selected discount rate columns represent the carrying value of bai as of the october 1 2020 measurement date prior to the 67 million impairment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2020 

sensitivity analysis  longterm growth rate 

for goodwill holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant including the discrete period revenue and profit performance assumptions as well as the discount rates the effect of a 050 decrease in the longterm growth rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units as of october 1 2020 would not change our conclusion 

for the indefinitelived intangible assets holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant including the discrete period revenue and profit performance assumptions as well as the discount rates the effect of a 050 decrease in the longterm revenue growth rate used to determine the fair value of our brands and trade names as of october 1 2020 would impact the amount of headroom over the carrying value of our brands and trade names as follows in millions 



1 the amounts listed in the selected longterm growth rate columns represent the carrying value of bai as of the october 1 2020 measurement date prior to the 67 million impairment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2020 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied accruals for customer incentives sales returns and marketing programs are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms volumebased metrics andor historical trends 

our customer incentives sales returns and marketing accrual methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding our contractual terms in order to estimate our customer participation and volume performance levels which impact the expense recognition our estimates are based primarily on a combination of known or historical transaction experiences differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized to earnings in the period differences are determined 

additionally judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a reduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense which is a component of our sga expenses 

a 10 change in the accrual for our customer incentives sales returns and marketing programs would have affected our income from operations by 38 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

income taxes 

we establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following 

• the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained 

• the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained but for a lesser amount or 

• the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 

our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions as these audits progress events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 

we also assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets primarily on historical earnings our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

if results differ from our assumptions a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate 

business combinations 

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill the fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques significant assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset if applicable 

if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill as discussed in the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets critical accounting estimate section above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

distribution rights associated with residual value guarantee 

on december 28 2020 one of our thirdparty bottlers sold their manufacturing and distribution rights to veyron spe subsequently we entered into a distribution arrangement with veyron spe which provided us access to distribute certain csd beverages such as canada dry 7up and aw in a number of counties in new york and new jersey in exchange for a fixed service fee and a residual value guarantee as a result of the residual value guarantee veyron spe was determined to be a vie however we did not consolidate the vie as we were not the primary beneficiary since the agreement provided us immediate distribution access without reacquiring ownership of the distribution rights asset and includes a guarantee on the assets of veyron spe we believe this is an offbalance sheet arrangement revenues and expenses related to the arrangement for the year ended december 31 2020 were not significant refer to note 16 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

multiemployer pension plans 

we currently participate and have in the past participated in multiemployer pension plans in the us if in the future we choose to withdraw from participation in one of these plans or we are deemed to have withdrawn from any of the multiemployer pension plans in which we currently participate or have participated in the past the plan will assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan and us gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multiemployer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable refer to note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our multiemployer pension plans 

there are no other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding refer to note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit

our competitors 

the beverage industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based on brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources in our bottling and manufacturing businesses we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers 

the following represents a list of our major competitors 



although these companies offer competing brands in categories we participate in they are also our partners and customers as they purchase beverage concentrates or kcup pod s directly from us 

our intellectual property 

we possess a variety of intellectual property rights that are important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets to safeguard our proprietary rights including our brands our technologies and ingredient and production formulas for our products 

we own numerous trademarks in our portfolio within the us  canada mexico and other countries depending upon the jurisdiction trademarks are valid as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

in many countries outside the us canada and mexico our rights to many of our csd brands including our dr pepper trademark and formula were sold by cadbury prior to 2008 to third parties including in certain cases to competitors such as cocacola  

we license various trademarks from third parties which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute certain products or brands throughout the us andor canada and mexico for example we license from third parties the sunkist soda stewarts roses and margaritaville trademarks although these licenses vary in length and other terms they generally are longterm cover the entire us andor canada and mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor 

we hold us and international patents related to keurig brewing systems and kcup pod technology of these a majority are utility patents and the remainder are design patents we view these patents as valuable assets but we do not view any single patent as critical to our success we also have pending patent applications associated with keurig brewing systems and kcup pod technology we take steps that we believe are appropriate to protect such innovation 

our raw materials 

the principal raw materials we use in our business which we commonly refer to as ingredients and packaging are green coffee pet bottles and caps aluminum cans and ends sweeteners paper products kcup pod packaging materials fruit glass bottles and enclosures juices teas water and other ingredients we also use postconsumer recycled materials in the manufacturing of our single serve brewing systems these ingredients and packaging costs can fluctuate substantially and comprise approximately 59 of our cost of sales 

when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process and transportation to our customers through the use of various commodity derivative contracts or supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position 

ingredients and materials excluding green coffee  under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans and ends natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pods pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

green coffee we purchase green coffee through outside brokers we develop and also pursue direct relationships with farms estates cooperatives and cooperative groups in order to support our broader traceability and sustainable supply chain initiatives in 2019  65 of our purchases of green coffee were responsibly sourced through third party sourcing programs which include a corresponding premium to the base commodity price we are committed to achieving 100 responsible sourcing by the end of 2020 in addition 97 of our green coffee purchases were traceable back to the exporter mill group or farm we believe that traceability helps us manage social and environmental risk secure longterm supplies of highquality coffee and identify opportunities for supply chain investments 

energy costs in addition to ingredients and packaging costs we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs which can also fluctuate substantially due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and the energy costs consumed in the production process the fuels costs associated with our distribution businesses are reflected within our sga expenses 

seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our cold beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months while hot beverage sales are generally higher during the cooler months overall beverage sales can also be influenced by the timing of holidays and weather fluctuations sales of brewing systems and related accessories are generally higher during the second half of the year due to the holiday shopping season 

environmental health and safety matters 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations we maintain environmental health and safety policies and a quality environmental health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations the cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations 

corporate responsibility 

in all we do we are committed to acting responsibly and our ambition is to ensure our beverages make a positive impact with every drink drink well do good is our corporate responsibility platform under this platform we focus on our greatest opportunities for impact in our supply chain the environment and our communities as part of our commitment to transparency and information sharing in these initiatives please refer to our corporate responsibility report available on our website at wwwkeurigdrpeppercom select highlights from the report are discussed below 

sustainable packaging 

sustainable packaging is a top priority for us and we continue to innovate for circular solutions across our portfolio weve set a goal to make 100 of our packaging recyclable or compostable by 2025 we also want to further contribute to the circular economy with our commitment to use 30 recycled material across our packaging portfolio by 2025 

already the majority of our bottles are recyclable and we are ensuring that our packaging materials are optimally designed to be the highest value possible for recycled plastic buyers which will increasingly include us to reduce contamination in the recycling stream we are replacing darkcolored plastics with clear making our bottles labels and caps compatible with widelyused bottle recycling processes and supporting consumer education campaigns on how to recycle right we have also partnered with the american beverage association and other beverage industry leaders on the every bottle back initiative  a breakthrough effort to reduce our industry’s use of new plastic and increase the recycling and reuse of our plastic bottles the initiative includes a 100 million industrybacked fund to invest in improved sorting processing and collection efforts that would increase the quality and availability of recycled plastic across the country 

we are on track to make all kcup pod s sold in the us recyclable by the end of 2020 having converted all kcup pod s sold in canada to a recyclable format in 2018 the new pods are made of polypropylene 5 plastic a material that is accepted curbside for recycling by many communities and we have conducted extensive testing with municipal recycling facilities to validate that they can be effectively recycled 

improving packaging solutions for product quality consumer use recoverability and reuse requires collaboration of all parties along the value chain using our strength in forming partnerships we collaborate closely with a number of stakeholders including industry groups ngo s and investment firms to move our commitments beyond independent ambitions to collective action 

health and wellbeing 

we are committed to providing a balanced portfolio of beverage options and the resources consumers need to make informed choices for themselves and their families in addition to our low calorie and portion control options for our full calorie beverages we also have a robust portfolio of zero low and mid calorie beverage brands 

we promote healthy lifestyles through our lets play initiative which provides funding equipment and play spaces for kids and families to make active play a daily priority through let’s play we partner with national nonprofit organizations to build and improve playgrounds in underserved communities and provide grants for sports equipment 

we also partner with our industry peers to promote balance through the balance calories initiative and through our think balance messaging which encourages consumers to balance what they drink with what they do

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to us following the dps merger 

optimizing our operations may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the dps merger may not be realized 

prior to the dps merger  dps and keurig operated independently during 2019 we significantly completed the integration of these legacy companies into kdp 

the success of the dps merger  including anticipated benefits and cost savings depends in part on our ability to optimize our operations the optimization of our operations following the dps merger is a complex costly and timeconsuming process which began in july 2018 upon the closing of the dps merger and remains ongoing if we experience difficulties in this process the anticipated benefits of the dps merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period after completion of the dps merger  there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the dps merger  

we are also incurring costs related to the optimization of our operations including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the optimization of our operations 

the unaudited historical pro forma combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and our actual financial condition and results of operations following the dps merger may differ materially 

the unaudited historical pro forma combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only are based on various adjustments assumptions and preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations for several reasons our actual financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the integration of the businesses may not be consistent with or evident from these unaudited historical pro forma combined financial statements in addition the assumptions used in preparing the unaudited historical pro forma combined financial statements may not be realized and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations any potential decline in our financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the unaudited historical pro forma financial statements and our stock price 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in intensely competitive categories 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and continue to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition and perception taste quality price availability product selection performance and convenience brand recognition and perception may be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media and online ratings and reviews of its products including our appliances in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brands image will depend on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including an increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns and marketing programs within the lrb category we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources 

our two largest competitors in the lrb category are cocacola and pepsico  each of which has a significantly higher share of the us lrb category than us we also compete in the lrb category against other large companies including nestlé and kraft heinz  these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products changing their route to market reducing prices or increasing promotional activities within the lrb category we also compete with a number of smaller brands and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as refresco group smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

a significant percentage of the coffee systems segments financial performance is attributable to sales of kcup pod s for use with keurig brewing systems for the year ended december 31 2019  revenue from kcup pod s represented approximately 80 of the net sales of the coffee systems segment we compete for sales of kcup pod s against local and regional brands as well as against private label brands developed by retailers our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the countries in which we operate or in various local marketplaces or maintain or enhance our relationships with our partners and customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors including as a result of increased consolidation in the food and beverage industry and a significant increase in the number of competitive pod contract manufacturers 

continued acceptance of keurig brewing systems and sales of kcup pod s to an increasing installed customer base are significant factors in our coffee systems growth plans any substantial or sustained decline in the sale of keurig brewing systems failure to continue to reduce the cost of keurig brewing systems or substantial or sustained decline in the sales of kcup pod s could materially and adversely affect our business keurig brewing systems compete against all sellers and types of coffeemakers if we do not succeed in continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing keurig brewing systems or differentiating keurig brewing systems from our competitors in the coffeemaker category based on technology quality of products desired brands or otherwise or our competitors adopt their respective strategies our competitive position may be weakened 

if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors our sales volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors which could impact our financial results 

consumers’ preferences can change due to a variety of factors including the age and ethnic demographics of the population social trends changes in consumer lifestyles negative publicity competitive product and pricing pressures economic downturn or other factors 

for example in the lrb industry consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csd s the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csd s and the use of natural organic or simple ingredients in lrb products the demand for csd s has therefore decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncb s such as water readytodrink coffee and teas and sports drinks a key component of our growth strategy is continuing to develop partner with or acquire products to cater to the next wave of consumer preferences including ncb s and other growing beverage categories if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer beverage preferences and quickly develop new products or partner with a current or new brand partner in that category in response our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive 

consumers are also increasingly focused on sustainability with particular attention to the recyclability of product packaging reducing consumption of singleuse plastics and nonrecyclable materials and the environmental impact of manufacturing operations if we do not meet consumer demands by providing recyclable packaging options and focusing on sustainability throughout our manufacturing operations our sales could suffer 

if we are not successful in timely responding to changing markets and consumer preferences andor some of our competitors are better able to respond to these changes our business and financial performance will be negatively affected 

our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us 

we use information technology and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities including supporting critical business operations communicating with our suppliers customers and employees maintaining financial information and effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services to conduct our business including a number of accounting internal control human resources and computing functions 

continuity of business applications and services has been and may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware our continuity of business applications and operations has been and may in the future be also disrupted by other cybersecurity attacks issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures denial of service telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic occurrences further cybersecurity breaches of our or third party systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking phishing attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached when risks such as these materialize the need for us to coordinate with various third party service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might make it more challenging to resolve the related issues additionally in the event of a cybersecurity breach of confidential information that we process and maintain about our employees or consumers through our ecommerce platform could be potentially exposed if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our third party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results loss of intellectual property breach of confidential information and damage to our reputation or brands 

we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery upgrading systems and networks enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data we are also in the process of enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment however security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis in addition due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident and the cost and operational expense of implementing maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly although we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of a breach or disruption such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses 

we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our future success depends upon the continued contributions of senior management and other key personnel and the ability to retain and motivate them if we are unable to retain and motivate the senior management team and other key personnel sufficiently to support the projected growth and initiatives of our business our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices and more favorable trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or trade terms that are favorable to retailers our respective margins would be reduced retailers also have leverage to require us to provide increased marketing and promotional expenditures including larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our partners including bottlers distributors and licensees do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer in addition certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products’ retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands accordingly the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers such as walmart and costco  key ecommerce retailers such as amazoncom and grocery customers 

if we are unable to offer terms that are acceptable to our significant customers or such customers determine that they need fewer inventories to service consumers these customers could reduce purchases of our products or may increase purchases of products from competitors which would harm our sales and profitability furthermore the loss of sales from a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we depend on thirdparty bottling and distribution companies for a significant portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to thirdparty bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segment’s operations generate a significant portion of our overall income from operations some of these bottlers such as pepsico  are also our competitors or also bottle and distribute a competitor’s products such as pepsico and cocacola affiliated bottlers the majority of these bottlers’ business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors’ products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors’ products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass price increases through to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond their control and their business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of thirdparty bottlers 

failure to maintain strategic relationships with wellrecognized brandsbrand owners and private label brands could adversely impact our future growth and business 

we have entered into strategic relationships for the manufacturing distribution and sale of kcup pod s with wellregarded beverage companies such as starbucks corporation dunkin’ brands group inc the jm smucker company kraft heinz  newman’s own organics mcdonalds peet’s coffee  tea and tim hortons as well as with retailers such as costco  the kroger co and walmart for their private label brands as independent companies our strategic partners make their own business decisions which may not align with our interests if we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our strategic partners through a combination of premium performance and service pricing and marketing and advertising support or if these strategic partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and technological or other development efforts they may take actions including entering into agreements with competing pod contract manufacturers or vertically integrating to manufacture their own kcup pod s increasing competition among kcup pod manufacturers and the move to vertical integration may result in price compression which could have an adverse effect on our gross margins the loss of strategic partners could also adversely impact our future profitability and growth awareness of keurig brewing systems our ability to attract additional branded or private label parties to do business with us or our ability to attract new consumers to buy keurig brewing systems 

our agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

approximately 95 of our 2019 packaged beverages net sales come from the manufacturing and distribution of our own brands and the manufacturing of certain private label beverages with the remaining from the distribution of allied brands which include but are not limited to vita coco coconut water evian water neuro drinks high brew rtd coffee forto coffee shots a shoc energy drinks peets rtd coffee and runa energy drinks 

we are subject to a risk of our allied brands terminating their agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance within each distribution agreement we have certain protections in case the allied brands terminate their agreements including a onetime termination payment 

us and international laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

our products are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us  canada mexico and other countries in which we conduct business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety sourcing labeling storing transportation marketing advertising distribution and sale of our products other laws and regulations that may impact our business relate to the environment relations with distributors and retailers employment privacy health and trade practices our expanding international business will also expose us to economic factors regulatory requirements increasing competition and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries our international business is also subject to us laws regulations and policies including anticorruption and export laws and regulations 

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture safety sourcing labeling storing transportation advertising distribution and sale of our products could damage our reputation andor result in criminal civil or administrative actions with substantial financial penalties and operational limitations in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures or significant challenges to our ability to continue to produce and sell products that generate a significant portion of our sales and profits for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs in addition changes in legislation imposing tariffs on or restricting the importation of our products or raw materials required to make our products restricting the sale of kcup pod s requiring compostability of kcup pod s limiting the ability of consumers to put kcup pod s into municipal waste or recycling streams or requiring manufacturers of kcup pod s to pay responsible producer or other fees to local or other governmental entities in connection with the collection recycling or disposition of kcup pod s could increase costs for us or at least for some period of time cut off a significant source of our sales and profits regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products such as california’s “proposition 65” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects are or could become applicable to our products 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates or at our other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers contract manufacturers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease epidemics strikes transportation or supply interruption contractual dispute government regulation cybersecurity attacks or terrorism moreover if demand increases more than we forecast we will need to either expand our capabilities internally or acquire additional capacity alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more than existing facilities or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

costs and supply for commodities such as raw materials and energy may change substantially and shortages may occur 

price increases for our raw materials could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers furthermore any price increases passed along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance furthermore price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for marktomarket changes in the derivative instruments 

the principal raw materials we use in our cold business include pet bottles and caps aluminum cans and ends sweeteners paper products fruit glass bottles and enclosures juices teas and water these raw materials are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base and their cost can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

our principal raw materials in our hot business include coffee beans and kcup pod raw materials including cups filter paper and other ingredients used in the manufacturing of our kcup pod s we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica coffee and related coffee products the arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price of coffee this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica coffee and also impacts our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease such as coffee rust general cost increases in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the factors described herein or a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we also have a limited number of suppliers for certain strategic raw materials critical for the manufacture of kcup pod s and the processing of certain key ingredients in our kcup pod s particularly for cups and filter paper in addition in order to ensure a continuous supply of highquality raw materials some of our inventory purchase obligations include longterm purchase commitments for certain strategic raw materials critical for the manufacture of kcup pod s and appliances the timing of these may not always coincide with the period in which we need the supplies to fulfill customer demand this could lead to higher and more variable inventory levels andor higher raw material costs for us 

if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability cybersecurity attacks and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business and therefore may be significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution business and our use of thirdparty carriers additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas 

if we do not successfully manage our investments in new business strategies or integrate and manage our acquired businesses or brands our operating results may adversely be affected 

we expect to acquire businesses or brands to expand our product portfolio and distribution rights and may invest in new business strategies andor joint ventures in evaluating such endeavors we will be required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business strategies opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and cost of potential liabilities furthermore we may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with any of our completed acquisitions and any future acquisitions including in connection with the integration or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures we may also experience delays in extending our respective internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in our financial records and in our consolidated financial statements additionally new ventures and investments are inherently risky and may not be successful and we may face challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from such investments or ventures any acquisitions investments or ventures may also result in the diversion of management attention and resources from other initiatives and operations our financial performance will depend in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands and the success of our other investments and ventures we may not achieve the strategic and financial objectives for such transactions if we are unable to achieve such objectives our consolidated results could be negatively affected 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us  canada mexico the caribbean or other geographies where we do business may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings we may be impacted by consumer price sensitivity associated with many of our products similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to supply materials timely additionally these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we also face counterparty risk for our cash investments and derivative instruments declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products including beverage products and our brewing systems we have various quality environmental health and safety supply chain standards a failure or perceived failure to meet our quality or safety standards including product contamination or tampering or allegations of mislabeling whether actual or perceived could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers manufacturers distributors or suppliers this could result in time consuming and expensive production interruptions recalls market withdrawals product liability claims and negative publicity it could also result in the destruction of product inventory lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time fines from applicable regulatory agencies and higherthananticipated rates of warranty returns and other returns of goods moreover negative publicity also could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls 

any or all of these events may lead to a loss of consumer confidence and trust could damage the goodwill associated with our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products and could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we have incurred significant indebtedness which could adversely affect us including decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense 

in connection with the dps merger  we incurred significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the dps merger  and thus the demands on our cash resources is greater than the amount of cash flows required to service dps ’s and maple ’s respective indebtedness prior to the dps merger  the increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the dps merger  or if our financial performance does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

additionally in assessing our credit strength credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as our results of operations and financial position at the time if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength the credit agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our current or future results of operations and financial position or for any other reason our cost of borrowing could increase furthermore a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could limit a financial institutions willingness to participate in our accounts payable program and reduce the attractiveness of the accounts payable program to participating suppliers who may sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions in addition a significant downgrade in our credit ratings may reduce flexibility of our business to engage in certain transactions such as the execution and renewal of certain leases 

moreover in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures the repayment or refinancing of its indebtedness acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

as of december 31 2019  we had 49518 million of total assets of which 20172 million were goodwill and 24117 million were other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinitelived intangible assets in connection with brands trade names acquired technology customer relationships contractual arrangements and favorable leases we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for additional information about these intangible assets see critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in item 7 and note 3 and note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances some of which are beyond our control factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products andor the product category resulting in diminished longterm revenue growth ii higher commodity or transportation prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition iv not achieving forecasted synergies from the dps merger v significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events and vi changes in our discount rates which could change due to factors such as movement in risk free interest rates changes in general market interest rate and market beta volatility among others since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate 

increases in our cost of benefits in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we will actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that it will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward cost pressure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and may affect our ability to operate our business 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness including the indentures governing the 11975 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and the kdp credit agreements governing the 2000 million 2019 kdp term loan  the 2400 million kdp revolver and the 750 million 364day credit agreement  contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict our ability including certain subsidiaries to incur debt and our ability including certain subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions our ability including certain subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 

deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity due to impacts on our suppliers customers and operating costs 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements 

financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face including their ability to access working capital could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them the timing of settlement for our obligation to the supplier or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers and to the extent these difficulties impact the timing of settlement for our obligation to the supplier we may have a decrease in our cash flow from operations and may have to use our various financing arrangements for shortterm liquidity needs 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes and nonincomebased taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly andor annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law in addition tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate among other things a number of countries are considering changes to their tax laws applicable to multinational corporate groups such as the tcja  some foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the tcja that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and operating results moreover many of the new provisions of the tcja will need to be implemented through us department of treasury regulations and other guidance that could impact the interpretation and effect of these provisions changes in tax laws regulations related interpretations and tax accounting standards in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our financial results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in mexico and canada may adversely affect our operating results 

while our operations are predominately in the us  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales expenses profits assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso the canadian dollar as well as other foreign currencies in which we transact business we may continue to hedge a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing derivative instruments for certain transactions however we are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations 

as a result our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates moreover any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit gross margin and income from operations from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year 

we continue to be exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that we may not be able to manage through derivative instruments and may incur material losses from such transactions utilizing derivative instruments 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend against claims we cannot be certain that the steps it takes to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we will continue to license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries third parties own a particular trademark or other intellectual property that we own in the us  canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola outside north america adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license rights to distribute thirdparty products the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

weather natural disasters water availability and climate change or related legislation could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather natural disasters or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel our ability to produce and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months or unusually warm weather during the winter months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

global climate change poses a serious threat to communities businesses farmers and ecosystems across the world climate change is already affecting the agricultural sector and disruptions to crop growing conditions are expected to increase with extreme weather events increasing temperatures and changing water availability water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

we are also faced with the impact of disruptions to crop growing conditions as a result of changing weather patterns which can cause changes in geographical ranges of crops as well as weeds diseases and pests that affect those crops these impacts may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities such as coffee corn and tea which are important sources of ingredients for our products 

concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we will operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging including kcup pod s and the disposal of kcup pod s cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

we rely on independent certification for a number of products loss of certification within our supply chain or as related to manufacturing processes could harm our business 

we rely on independent certification such as certifications of products as “organic” or “responsibly sourced” to differentiate some products from others we must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as certified the loss of any independent certifications could adversely affect our marketplace position which could harm our business 

we rely on the performance of a limited number of suppliers manufacturers and order fulfillment companies 

a small number of companies manufacture the vast majority of our brewing systems with a majority of the brewing systems we sell procured from one thirdparty brewing system manufacturer if these manufacturers are not able to scale their manufacturing operations to match increasing consumer demand for our brewing systems at competitive costs our overall results will be negatively affected our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers also exposes us to increased risk that certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals that are contained in our brewing systems have originated from covered countries as defined in section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 but cannot be determined to be conflict free as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

in addition we rely on a limited number of key suppliers and distribution and fulfillment partners for material aspects of our business as a result we may have limited negotiation leverage with regards to these suppliers which could negatively affect the business and financial performance of our business 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience union activity including labor disputes or work stoppages 

approximately 8000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in labor disputes strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing renewed or expanded agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

we depend on key information systems and thirdparty service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on thirdparty providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting collecting storing and transmitting our primary data center and processing various accounting and transactional services an offshore shared service center managed by third parties provides lower cost services to conduct our business including a number of accounting tax and computing functions if any of these thirdparty service providers or vendors do not perform effectively or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations in addition the management of multiple thirdparty service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control 

our information systems contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

in addition because we accept debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to the pci standard  issued by the payment card industry security standards council the pci standard contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of cardholder data we are not fully compliant with the pci standard and there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to operate our facilities and our customer service and sales operations in accordance with pci or other industry recommended or contractually required practices we are in the process to be in compliance with the pci standard  however complying with the pci standard and implementing related procedures technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to achieve compliance with the pci standard or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations even if we are compliant with pci standard  we still may not be able to prevent security breaches any material interruptions or failures in our paymentrelated systems could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

in addition some of our commercial partners may receive or store information provided by us or our users through their websites including information entrusted to them by customers if we or these thirdparty commercial partners fail to adopt or adhere to adequate information security practices or fail to comply with their respective online policies or in the event of a breach of our networks our users’ data and customer information may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information disrupting business processes or corrupting information these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets litigation regulatory actions or investigations remediation costs damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event which could adversely affect our business 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

from time to time we may be a party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings that may include employment tort real estate antitrust environmental recyclingsustainability intellectual property commercial securities false advertising packaging product labeling consumer protection and other claims from time to time we may be a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling including under california’s “proposition 65” public statements and disclosures under securities laws antitrust advertising consumer protection and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts that are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we will base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost and any required actions arising out of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have programs of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we may continue to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones additionally we rely on third parties for the construction and renovation of our facilities and manufacturing of our production equipment if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities or third parties fail to complete the construction or renovation of facilities or production equipment in a timely manner or in accordance with our specifications our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

due to the seasonality of many of our products and other factors our operating results are subject to fluctuations 

historically we have experienced increased consumer retail and ecommerce sales of the keurig brewing systems in the second half of the year due to the holiday season if sales of keurig brewing systems during the holiday season do not meet expectations sales of our kcup pod s throughout the year will be negatively impacted the impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business in addition our operating results can be impacted by seasonal fluctuation as a result our quarterly operating results are subject to these same seasonality factors 

failure to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results 

in many countries including the us  we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned and are taxed accordingly 

although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed 

in the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to our positions we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of us foreign tax credits because the laws and regulations governing us foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment we cannot be sure that we will in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future 

risks relating to our capital structure 

jab through its affiliate is our largest stockholder and owns approximately 66 of the fully diluted shares of our common stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over decisions requiring our stockholders’ approval 

we are controlled by jab  through its affiliate maple holdings bv which owns approximately 66 of the fully diluted shares of our common stock which gives them the ability to exercise significant influence over decisions requiring approval of our stockholders including the election of directors amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of us or our assets 

this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change in control of us and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock also jab and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete with us jab or its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

we meet the requirements to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the nyse and as a result we qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance standards which limit the presence of independent directors on our board of directors and board committees 

as discussed above approximately 66 of the outstanding shares of our common stock are held by jab and its affiliates as a result we are a “controlled company” for purposes of section 303a of the nyse listed company manual and are exempt from certain governance requirements otherwise required by the nyse  under section 303a a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual a group or another company is a “controlled company” and is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements including requirements that 1 a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and 3 director nominees be selected or recommended for selection by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominatingcorporate governance committee composed solely of independent directors we continue to have an audit committee that is composed entirely of independent directors 

as a result of relying on the controlled company exemptions the procedures for approving significant corporate decisions could be determined by directors who have a direct or indirect interest in such decisions and our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of other companies that are required to comply with all of the independence rules of the nyse

segments 

as of december 31 2019  we report our business in four operating segments 

 volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates finished beverages pods or brewers 

coffee systems kcup pod and appliance sales volume 

in our coffee systems segments we measure our sales volume as the number of appliances and the number of individual kcup pod s sold to our customers 

packaged beverages and latin america beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages and latin america beverages segments we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume as concentrate case sales the unit of measurement for concentrate case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings 

concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases 

comparable results of operations 

as a result of the dps merger  in order for management to discuss our historical results on a comparable basis we prepared unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to illustrate the estimated effects of the dps merger  which was consummated on july 9 2018 based on the historical results of operations of dps and maple see supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information section at the end of managements discussion and analysis for further information on the assumptions used in the preparation of the financial information 

furthermore management believes that there are certain nongaap financial measures that allow management to evaluate our results trends and ongoing performance on a comparable basis in order to derive the adjusted financial information for the year ended december 31 2019 we adjusted certain financial statement captions and metrics for certain items affecting comparability for the year ended december 31 2018 we adjusted certain financial statement captions and metrics prepared on a pro forma basis for certain items affecting comparability see nongaap financial measures for further information on the certain items affecting comparability used in the preparation of the financial information 

presentation of these adjusted financial statement captions and metrics in the tables below compare adjusted financial information for the year ended december 31 2019 to adjusted pro forma financial information for the year ended december 31 2018 to provide more meaningful comparisons between years as a result of the dps merger  

executive summary

net income attributable to kdp increased 668 million to 1254 million for the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 586 million for the year ended december 31 2018  primarily driven by the incremental impact in the current year of the dps merger completed in 2018 including the favorable comparison to the 158 million of transaction costs and the 131 million impact of the inventory stepup associated with the dps merger recorded in the year ended december 31 2018  diluted eps increased 660 to 088 as compared to 053 in the prior year 

adjusted net income increased 269 million  or 184  to 1727 million  compared to adjusted pro forma net income of 1458 million in the prior year this change primarily reflected the growth in adjusted income from operations lower adjusted interest expense driven by deleveraging and the benefit of unwinding several interest rate swap contracts and a lower effective tax rate due to the tcja  additionally adjusted net income was impacted by the year ago comparison of the nonoperating benefits of a cash distribution from bodyarmor in connection with our unitholder interest and a gain on our prior equity interest in core as a result of the core acquisition and an increase in our share of losses from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates driven by bedford  adjusted diluted eps increased 173 to 122  as compared to adjusted pro form diluted eps of 104 in the prior year

selling general and administrative expenses sga expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 1327 million to 3962 million compared with the year ended december 31 2018  the primary driver of the increase in sga expenses was the incremental impact in the current year of the dps merger completed in 2018 including acquired operating costs transaction costs and restructuring expenses associated with the integration of dps and maple  

other operating expense income net other operating expense income net had a favorable change of 8 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the year ended december 31 2018  during 2019 the impairment of real estate and equipment was partially offset by a network optimization program gain of 30 million related to the asset saleleaseback of three manufacturing facilities as compared to unfavorable fair value adjustments on real estate assets held for sale in 2018 

income from operations income from operations increased 1141 million to 2378 million for the year ended december 31 2019  primarily driven by the incremental impact in the current year of the dps merger completed in 2018 with the increase in gross profit partially offset by an increase in sga expenses 

interest expense interest expense increased 253 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to the full year impact of the increased borrowings and the assumption of existing senior unsecured notes as a result of the dps merger  as well as the impact of our interest rate derivative instruments partially offset by the impact of net repayments to our 2019 notes our term loans and our commercial paper notes 

interest expense  related party interest expense  related party decreased 51 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 as a result of the capitalization of the related party term loans into additional paidin capital during the dps merger completed in 2018

other expense income net other expense income net had an unfavorable change of 38 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the year ended december 31 2018  driven primarily by an increase in our share of losses from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates driven by bedford as well as the unfavorable comparison to the gain on a cash distribution from bodyarmor in the prior year

adjusted results of operations

adjusted net sales adjusted net sales increased 96 million  or 09  to 11120 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to adjusted pro forma net sales of 11024 million in the prior year this performance reflected strong underlying net sales growth of 32  driven by higher volumemix of 26 and net price realization of 06  which was partially offset by the expected unfavorable impact related to changes in our allied brands portfolio of 21  unfavorable foreign currency translation also impacted the year by 02  

adjusted income from operations adjusted income from operations increased 270 million  or 103  to 2890 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to adjusted pro forma income from operations of 2620 million in the prior year this performance primarily reflected the strong productivity and merger synergies both of which benefitted sga and cost of sales and growth in underlying net sales partially offset by inflation in input costs led by packaging and logistics and the comparison to a 22 million gain from the remeasurement of our equity investment in big red unfavorable foreign currency translation also impacted the year by 02  adjusted operating margin grew 220 bps to 260 in the year ended december 31 2019  

adjusted interest expense adjusted interest expense decreased 82 million  or 129  to 553 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to adjusted pro forma interest expense of 635 million in the prior year this change primarily reflected the benefits of lower indebtedness due to continued deleveraging realized gains associated with the termination of certain interest rate swaps and the benefit of lower interest rates as a result of our existing interest rate swaps 

adjusted effective tax rate the adjusted effective tax rate decreased 90 bps to 255 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to adjusted pro forma effective tax rate of 264 in the prior year this decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the us federal tax rate from 245 to 210 partially offset by the loss of tax benefits associated with the us domestic manufacturing deduction in 2019

liquidity and capital resources 

trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by all risk factors discussed in item 1a risk factors that could have a material effect on production delivery and consumption of our products in the us  mexico and the caribbean or canada which could result in a reduction in our sales volume similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials 

we believe that the following events trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity 



financing arrangements 

refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for managements discussion of financing arrangements 

libor considerations 

in 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that libor will no longer be published after 2021 in the us  the alternative reference rates committee selected the secured overnight financing rate as the preferred alternative reference rate to libor  

we have a number of financing arrangements which incorporate libor as a benchmark rate and which extend past 2021 including the 2019 kdp term loan agreement and the kdp revolver  the agreements related to such financing arrangements contain provisions for alternative reference rates and we do not expect a significant change to our cost of debt as a result of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate 

liquidity 

based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary 

the following table summarizes our cash activity for the periods 



net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 861 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to additional cash flows from operations generated as a result of the dps merger  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by the increase in net income adjusted for noncash items and the improvement in working capital primarily driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers partially offset by the payment and deferral of customer incentives 

as of december 31 2019  the company deferred estimated tax payments of 59 million which were paid in january 2020 as compared to no deferral of estimated tax payments as of december 31 2018  

cash conversion cycle

our cash conversion cycle increased 1 day to approximately 46 days as of december 31 2019 as compared to 47 days as of december 31 2018  the following table summarizes our cash conversion cycle 



in future periods dpo is expected to have a positive impact on our cash conversion cycle as a result of our supplier terms initiative which has set our customary terms as we integrate our legacy businesses 

accounts payable program 

as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which include the extension of payment terms excluding our suppliers who require cash at date of purchase or sale our current payment terms with our suppliers generally range from 10 to 360 days we also entered into an agreement with a third party administrator to allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us and if voluntarily elected by the supplier sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  2097 million and 1438 million  respectively of our outstanding payment obligations were voluntarily elected by the supplier and sold to financial institutions the amounts settled through the program and paid to the financial institutions were 1745 million and 1477 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively

net cash provided by financing activities for year ended december 31 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 9000 million  issuance of unsecured notes of 8000 million  proceeds from the 2018 kdp term loan of 2700 million and net issuance of commercial paper notes of 1080 million  these cash inflows from financing activities were partially offset by repayments on the 2018 kdp term loan of 3447 million  these activities were used to accommodate the dps merger and reflect subsequent repayments since the dps merger  

debt ratings 

as of december 31 2019  our credit ratings were as follows 



these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 330 million and 180 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily related to manufacturing equipment our continued investment in the construction of our new spartanburg facility in south carolina and information technology infrastructure

contractual commitments and obligations 

we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies as of december 31 2019  



 amounts excluded from our table 

as of december 31 2019  we had 56 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits related interest and penalties classified as a longterm liability the table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment refer to note 7 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension recognized as of december 31 2019 was approximately 22 million  this amount is impacted by among other items funding levels plan amendments changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table abovethe pension protection act of 2006 was enacted in august 2006 and established among other things new standards for funding of us defined benefit pension plans we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations we did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above 

we have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities we did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control 

in general we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are selfinsured for large portions of many different types of claims our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history as of december 31 2019  our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs totaled approximately 105 million  

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

we currently participate in three multiemployer pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan and us gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multiemployer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable refer to note 8 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our multiemployer pension plans 

there are no other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices from time to time we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge or mitigate commercial risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation investing or trading 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars however we have exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred as of december 31 2019  the impact to our income from operations of a 10 change up or down in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 30 million on an annual basis 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2019  we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 523 million maturing at various dates through september 1 2024  

interest rate risk 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio through the use of interest rate swaps and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as of december 31 2019  the carrying value of our fixedrate debt excluding capital lease obligations was 11802 million and our variablerate debt was 2618 million  inclusive of commercial paper 

additionally as of december 31 2019  the total notional value of receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps was 50 million and the total notional value of receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps was 575 million  

the following table is an estimate of the impact to our interest expense based upon our variable rate debt and derivative instruments and the fair value of the interest rate swaps that could result from hypothetical interest rate changes during the term of the financial instruments based on debt levels as of december 31 2019  



 commodity risks 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of coffee beans pet aluminum diesel fuel corn for high fructose corn syrup apple juice concentrate apples sucrose and natural gas for use in processing and packaging 

we utilize commodities derivative instruments and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2019 was a net liability of 20 million  

as of december 31 2019  the impact of a 10 change up or down in market prices for these commodities where the risk of movements has not been hedged is estimated to have a 25 million impact to our income from operations for the year ended december 31 2020

our allied brands 

as a result of our distribution capabilities we believe brand owners view us as a partner with a strong routetomarket resources to grow their brands these partnerships allow us to rapidly participate in growth in emerging and fast growing categories where we do not currently have a brand presence we sometimes make an investment in each company as of december 31 2018  our portfolio of allied brands we distribute included but was not limited to evian peets ready to drink coffee forto coffee vita coco coconut waters high brew coffee and neuro drinks 

our competitors 

the beverage industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based on brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources in our bottling and manufacturing businesses we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers 

the following represents a list of our major competitors 



although these companies offer competing brands in categories we participate in several of these companies are also our partners and customers such as cocacola pepsico and kraft heinz as they purchase beverage concentrates or kcup pod s directly from us 

our intellectual property 

we possess a variety of intellectual property rights that are important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets to safeguard our proprietary rights including our brands our technologies and ingredient and production formulas for our products 

we own numerous trademarks in our portfolio within the us canada mexico and other countries depending upon the jurisdiction trademarks are valid as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

in many countries outside the us canada and mexico our rights to many of our csd brands including our dr pepper trademark and formula were sold by cadbury beginning over a decade ago to third parties including in certain cases to competitors such as cocacola 

we license various trademarks from third parties which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute certain products or brands throughout the us andor canada and mexico for example we license from third parties the sunkist soda stewarts roses and margaritaville trademarks although these licenses vary in length and other terms they generally are longterm cover the entire us andor canada and mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor 

we hold us and international patents related to keurig brewing systems and kcup pod  technology of these a majority are utility patents and the remainder are design patents we view these patents as valuable assets but we do not view any single patent as critical to our success we also have pending patent applications associated with keurig brewing systems and kcup pod  technology we take steps that we believe appropriate to protect such innovation 

our raw materials 

the principal raw materials we use in our business which we commonly refer to as ingredients and packaging are aluminum cans and ends pet bottles and caps kcup pod  packaging materials glass bottles and enclosures green coffee paper products juices teas fruit sweeteners water and other ingredients we also use postconsumer recycled materials in the manufacturing of our singleserve brewing systemsthese ingredients and packaging costs can fluctuate substantially and comprise approximately 55  of our cost of sales 

when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process and transportation to our customers through the use of various commodity derivative contracts or supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of shortterm predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position 

ingredients and materials excluding green coffee  under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans and ends natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

green coffee we use a combination of outside brokers and direct relationships with farms estates cooperatives and cooperative groups for our supply of green coffee outside brokers are the largest source of our green coffee supply in 2018  31 of our purchases of green coffee were responsibly sourced and 84 were traceable back to the exporter mill group or farm we believe that traceability helps us secure longterm supplies of highquality coffee the majority of our green coffee purchases are highquality premium grade which results in higher prices as compared to regular green coffee 

fuel costs in addition to ingredients and packaging costs we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs which can also fluctuate substantially due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and the energy costs consumed in the production process the fuels costs associated with our distribution businesses are reflected within our selling general and administrative sga expenses 

seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our cold beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months while hot beverage sales are generally higher during the cooler months overall beverage sales can also be influenced by the timing of holidays and weather fluctuations 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 25500  employees 

in the us we have approximately 20000  fulltime employees we have collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 4500  fulltime employees these agreements address working conditions as well as wage rates and benefits

we believe we have good relations with our employees 

environmental health and safety matters 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations we maintain environmental health and safety policies and a quality environmental health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations the cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations 

sustainability 

we are committed to making a positive impact in the communities in which we live and work and to leave the world better than we found it we continue to focus on efforts to improve sustainability throughout our value chain working to reduce our environmental impact while helping to ensure the companys financial growth these efforts include 



postconsumer recycling 

for csds and ncbs the vast majority of our beverage containers are 100 recyclable for our coffee systems products we completed the conversion to 100 recyclable kcup pod s in canada at the end of 2018 targeting to have all our manufactured kcup pod s recyclable by 2020 our thirdparty manufacturers also use postconsumer recycled materials in the manufacturing of our singleserve brewing systems 

we are looking beyond our own operations to address the issue of postconsumer recycling we continue to work with industry government and community partners on goals and efforts to increase us beverage container recycling rates we maintain active involvement partnerships and investments in efforts to improve consumer recycling including focused efforts with keep america beautiful the closed loop fund and the recycling partnership 

regulatory matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business regulations apply to many aspects of our business including our products and their ingredients manufacturing safety labeling transportation recycling advertising and sale for example our products and their manufacturing labeling marketing and sale in the us are subject to various aspects of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal trade commission act the lanham act state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws certain cities and municipalities within the us have also passed various taxes on the distribution of sugarsweetened and diet beverages which are at different stages of enactment in canada and mexico the manufacture distribution marketing and sale of many of our products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations additionally the government of mexico enacted broad based tax reform in 2016 including a tax on every liter of certain sugarsweetened beverages we manufacture

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to us following the dps merger 

combining the hot and cold businesses may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the dps merger may not be realized 

prior to the dps merger  dr pepper snapple group inc a delaware corporation “dps” and keurig green mountain inc a delaware corporation “keurig” operated independently the success of the dps merger  including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate its hot and cold businesses 

integration of the hot and cold businesses following the dps merger  is a complex costly and timeconsuming process if we experience difficulties with the integration process as it progresses the anticipated benefits of the dps merger  may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected these integration matters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period after completion of the dps merger  in addition the actual cost savings of the dps merger  could be less than anticipated 

our future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations 

following the completion of the dps merger the size of our combined business is significantly larger than the size of either dps or keurig’s respective businesses prior to the dps merger our ability to successfully manage this expanded business depends in part upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two discrete companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the dps merger 

we incurred substantial expenses related to the completed dps merger and will continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the hot and cold businesses 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the dps merger and combining the hot and cold businesses the substantial majority of nonrecurring expenses were comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the dps merger we are also incurring transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the hot and cold businesses 

the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and our actual financial condition and results of operations following the dps merger may differ materially 

the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only are based on various adjustments assumptions and preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations for several reasons our actual financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the integration of the businesses may not be consistent with or evident from these unaudited pro forma combined financial statements in addition the assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements may not be realized and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations any potential decline in our financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the pro forma financial statements and our stock price 

in connection with the dps merger we incurred significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense 

in connection with the dps merger we incurred significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the dps merger and thus the demands on our cash resources is greater than the amount of cash flows required to service dps’s and maple’s respective indebtedness prior to the dps merger the increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the dps merger or if our financial performance does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

in addition in assessing our credit strength credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as our results of operations and financial position at the time if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength the credit agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our current or future results of operations and financial position or for any other reason our cost of borrowing could increase on may 11 2018 and may 14 2018 dps’s longterm credit ratings were downgraded by moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and standard  poors sp respectively but still maintained an investment grade rating 

moreover in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures the repayment or refinancing of its indebtedness acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

risks relating to our capital structure 

jab through its affiliate is our largest stockholder and owns approximately 72 of the fully diluted shares of our common stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over decisions requiring our stockholders’ approval 

we are controlled by jab through its affiliate maple holdings bv   sponsor which owns approximately 72 of the fully diluted shares of our common stock which gives them the ability to exercise significant influence over decisions requiring approval of our stockholders including the election of directors amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of us or our assets 

this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change in control of us and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock also jab and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete with us jab or its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

we meet the requirements to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the nyse and as a result we qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance standards which limit the presence of independent directors on our board of directors and board committees 

as discussed above approximately 72 of the outstanding shares of our common stock are held by jab and its affiliates as a result we are a “controlled company” for purposes of section 303a of the nyse listed company manual and are exempt from certain governance requirements otherwise required by the nyse under section 303a a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual a group or another company is a “controlled company” and is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements including requirements that 1 a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and 3 director nominees be selected or recommended for selection by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominatingcorporate governance committee composed solely of independent directors we continue to have an audit committee that is composed entirely of independent directors 

as a result of relying on the controlled company exemptions the procedures for approving significant corporate decisions could be determined by directors who have a direct or indirect interest in such decisions and our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of other companies that are required to comply with all of the independence rules of the nyse 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in intensely competitive categories 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and continue to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition and perception taste quality price availability product selection performance and convenience brand recognition and perception may be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media and online ratings and reviews of its products including our appliances in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brands image will depend on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including an increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns and marketing programs within the liquid refreshment beverage lrb category we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources 

our two largest competitors in the lrb category are cocacola and pepsico each of which has a significantly higher share of the us lrb category than us we also compete in the lrb category against other large companies including nestle campbell and kraft heinz these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products changing their route to market reducing prices or increasing promotional activities within the lrb category we also compete with a number of smaller brands and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as refresco group smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

our hot business competes with major international beverage and appliance companies that operate in multiple geographic areas as well as numerous companies that are primarily local in operation our hot business also competes against local and regional brands as well as against private label brands developed by retailers our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the countries in which we operate or in various local marketplaces or maintain or enhance our relationships with our partners and customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors including as a result of increased consolidation in the food and beverage industry and a significant increase in the number of competitive pod contract manufacturers several of whom offer what they market as more environmentally friendly pods than the current kcup pod s we manufacture 

if we are unable to compete effectively against these hot beverage and appliance companies our sales volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors which could impact our financial results   

consumers’ preferences can change due to a variety of factors including the age and ethnic demographics of the population social trends changes in consumer lifestyles negative publicity competitive product and pricing pressures economic downturn or other factors 

for example in the lrb industry consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds and the use of natural organic or simple ingredients in lrb products as such the demand for csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs such as water readytodrink coffee and teas and sports drinks 

a key component of our growth strategy is continuing to develop partner with or acquire products to cater to the next wave of beverage preferences including ncbs and the growing cold brew and readytodrink coffeebased beverage categories 

if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences and quickly develop new products or partner with a current or new brand partner in that category in response our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices and more favorable trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or trade terms that are favorable to retailers our respective margins would be reduced retailers also have leverage to require us to provide increased marketing and promotional expenditures including larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our partners including bottlers distributors and licensees do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer in addition certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products’ retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands accordingly the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers such as walmart and costco key ecommerce retailers such as amazoncom and grocery customers 

if we are unable to offer terms that are acceptable to our significant customers or such customers determine that they need fewer inventories to service consumers these customers could reduce purchases of our products or may increase purchases of products from competitors which would harm our sales and profitability furthermore the loss of sales from a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products including beverage products and our brewing systems we have various quality environmental health and safety standards a failure or perceived failure to meet our quality or safety standards or allegations of mislabeling whether actual or perceived could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers manufacturers distributors or suppliers this could result in time consuming and expensive production interruptions recalls market withdrawals product liability claims and negative publicity it could also result in the destruction of product inventory lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time and higherthananticipated rates of warranty returns and other returns of goods moreover negative publicity also could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls 

any or all of these events may lead to a loss of consumer confidence and trust could damage the goodwill associated with our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products and could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

costs and supply for commodities such as raw materials and energy may change substantially and shortages may occur 

price increases for our raw materials could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers furthermore any price increases passed along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance furthermore price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for marktomarket changes in the derivative instruments 

the principal raw materials we use in our cold business include aluminum cans and ends glass bottles polyethylene terephthalate “pet” bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit and water these raw materials are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base and their cost can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

our principal raw materials in our hot business include coffee beans and kcup pod  raw materials including cups filter paper and other ingredients used in the manufacturing of our kcup pod s we purchase roast and sell highquality whole bean arabica coffee and related coffee products the arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” price of coffee this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increases in the “c” coffee commodity price do increase the price of highquality arabica coffee and also impacts our ability to enter into fixedprice purchase commitments we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established these are known as pricetobefixed contracts the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries including weather natural disasters crop disease such as coffee rust general increase in farm inputs and costs of production inventory levels and political and economic conditions as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the factors described herein or a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we also have a limited number of suppliers for certain strategic raw materials critical for the manufacture of kcup pod s and the processing of certain key ingredients in our kcup pod s particularly for cups and filter paper in addition in order to ensure a continuous supply of highquality raw materials some of our inventory purchase obligations include longterm purchase commitments for certain strategic raw materials critical for the manufacture of kcup pod s and appliances the timing of these may not always coincide with the period in which we need the supplies to fulfill customer demand this could lead to higher and more variable inventory levels andor higher raw material costs for us 

if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability cybersecurity attacks and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business and therefore may be significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution business and our use of thirdparty carriers additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

as of december 31 2018 we had 48918 million  of total assets of which approximately 20011 million were goodwill and 23967 million  were other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinitelived intangible assets in connection with brands trade names acquired technology customer relationships contractual arrangements and favorable leases we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for additional information about these intangible assets see critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in item 7 and note 3 and note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances some of which are beyond our control factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products andor the product category ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events and v changes in our discount rates which could change due to factors such as movement in risk free interest rates changes in general market interest rate and market beta volatility among others since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate 

if we do not successfully manage our investments in new business strategies or integrate and manage our acquired businesses or brands our operating results may adversely be affected 

we expect to acquire businesses or brands to expand our product portfolio and distribution rights and may invest in new business strategies andor joint ventures in evaluating such endeavors we will be required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business strategies opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and cost of potential liabilities furthermore we may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with any of our completed acquisitions and any future acquisitions including in connection with the integration or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures we may also experience delays in extending our respective internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in our financial records and in our consolidated financial statements additionally new ventures and investments are inherently risky and may not be successful and we may face challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from such investments or ventures any acquisitions investments or ventures may also result in the diversion of management attention and resources from other initiatives and operations our financial performance will depend in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands and the success of our other investments and ventures we may not achieve the strategic and financial objectives for such transactions if we are unable to achieve such objectives our consolidated results could be negatively affected 

we will continue to depend on thirdparty bottling and distribution companies for a significant portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to thirdparty bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segment’s operations generate a significant portion of our overall income from operations some of these bottlers such as pepsico are also our competitors or also bottle and distribute a competitor’s products such as pepsico and cocacola affiliated bottlers the majority of these bottlers’ business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors’ products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors’ products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass price increases through to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond their control and their business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of thirdparty bottlers 

our hot business financial performance depends upon the sales of keurig brewing systems and kcup pod s 

a significant percentage of the hot business financial performance is attributable to sales of kcup pod s for use with keurig brewing systems for the year ended december 31 2018 revenue from kcup pod s represented approximately 43 of the hot business consolidated net revenue continued acceptance of keurig brewing systems and sales of kcup pod s to an increasing installed customer base will be significant factors in our hot business growth plans any substantial or sustained decline in the sale of keurig brewing systems failure to continue to reduce the cost of keurig brewing systems or substantial or sustained decline in the sales of kcup pod s could materially adversely affect our business keurig brewing systems compete against all sellers and types of coffeemakers if we do not succeed in continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing keurig brewing systems or differentiating keurig brewing systems from our competitors in the coffeemaker category based on technology quality of products desired brands or otherwise or our competitors adopt their respective strategies our competitive position may be weakened and our sales of keurig brewing systems and kcup pod s and accordingly our business and financial performance may be materially adversely affected 

we will continue to rely on the performance of a limited number of suppliers manufacturers and order fulfillment companies 

a small number of companies manufacture the vast majority of our brewing systems with a majority of the brewing systems we sell procured from one thirdparty brewing system manufacturer if these manufacturers are not able to scale their manufacturing operations to match increasing consumer demand for our brewing systems at competitive costs our overall results will be negatively affected our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers also exposes us to increased risk that certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals that are contained in our brewing systems have originated from covered countries as defined in section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 but cannot be determined to be conflict free as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

in addition we rely on a limited number of key suppliers and distribution and fulfillment partners for material aspects of our business as a result we may have limited negotiation leverage with regards to these suppliers which could negatively affect the business and financial performance of our business following the dps merger 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates or at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers contract manufacturers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation or supply interruption contractual dispute government regulation cybersecurity attacks or terrorism moreover if demand increases more than we forecast we will need to either expand our capabilities internally or acquire additional capacity alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more than existing facilities or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

increases in our cost of benefits in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we will actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that it will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward cost pressure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience union activity including labor disputes or work stoppages 

approximately 8000  of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in labor disputes strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing renewed or expanded agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

failure to maintain strategic relationships with wellrecognized brandsbrand owners and private label brands could adversely impact our future growth and business 

we have entered into strategic relationships for the manufacturing distribution and sale of kcup pod s with wellregarded beverage companies such as dunkin’ brands group inc smucker tim hortons newman’s own organics kraft heinz peet’s coffee  tea and starbucks corporation as well as with retailers such as costco the kroger co and walmart for their private label brands as independent companies our strategic partners make their own business decisions which may not align with our interests if we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our strategic partners through a combination of premium performance and service pricing and marketing and advertising support or if these strategic partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and technological or other development efforts they may take actions including entering into agreements with competing pod contract manufacturers or vertically integrating to manufacture their own kcup pod s increasing competition among kcup pod  manufacturers and the move to vertical integration may result in price compression which could have an adverse effect on our gross margins the loss of strategic partners could also adversely impact our future profitability and growth awareness of keurig brewing systems our ability to attract additional branded or private label parties to do business with us or our ability to attract new consumers to buy keurig brewing systems 

our agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

approximately 90 of our 2018 packaged beverages net sales come from the manufacturing and distribution of our own brands and the manufacturing of certain private label beverages with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands currently our allied brands include but not limited to vita coco coconut water arizona tea neuro drinks high brew evian peets coffee and forto coffee 

we are subject to a risk of our allied brands terminating their agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance during 2018 both ba sports nutrition llc bodyarmor and fiji mineral water terminated their agreements with us within each distribution agreement we have certain protections in case the allied brands terminate their agreements including a onetime termination payment 

we depend on key information systems and thirdparty service providers   

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on thirdparty providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting collecting storing and transmitting our primary data center and processing various benefitrelated accounting and transactional services our information systems contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

in addition because we accept debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard the “pci standard” issued by the payment card industry security standards council the pci standard contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of cardholder data we are not fully compliant with the pci standard and there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to operate our facilities and our customer service and sales operations in accordance with pci or other industry recommended or contractually required practices we are in the process to be in compliance with the pci standard however complying with the pci standard and implementing related procedures technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to achieve compliance with the pci standard or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations even if we are compliant with pci standard we still may not be able to prevent security breaches any material interruptions or failures in our paymentrelated systems could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

in addition some of our commercial partners may receive or store information provided by us or our users through their websites including information entrusted to them by customers if we or these thirdparty commercial partners fail to adopt or adhere to adequate information security practices or fail to comply with their respective online policies or in the event of a breach of our networks our users’ data and customer information may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information disrupting business processes or corrupting information these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets litigation regulatory actions or investigations remediation costs damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event which could adversely affect our business 

our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us 

our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us 

we use information technology and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities including supporting critical business operations communicating with our suppliers customers and employees maintaining financial information and effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services to conduct our business including a number of accounting internal control human resources and computing functions 

continuity of business applications and services has been and may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware our continuity of business applications and operations has been and may in the future be also disrupted by other cybersecurity attacks issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures denial of service telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic occurrences further cybersecurity breaches of our or third party systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking phishing attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached when risks such as these materialize the need for us to coordinate with various third party service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might make it more challenging to resolve the related issues additionally in the event of a cybersecurity breach confidential information that we process and maintain about our employees or consumers through our ecommerce platform could be potentially exposed if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our third party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results loss of intellectual property breach of confidential information and damage to our reputation or brands 

in february 2019 our business operation networks in the coffee systems segment were disrupted by an organized malware attack we have taken actions to address this attack and to implement further safeguards against similar attacks we continue to evaluate the impact on our business and are working to finalize the resolution of these actions 

we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery upgrading systems and networks enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data we are also in the process of enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment however security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis in addition due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident and the cost and operational expense of implementing maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly although we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of a breach or disruption such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses 

we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

us and international laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

our products are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we conduct business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety sourcing labeling storing transportation marketing advertising distribution and sale of our products other laws and regulations that may impact our business relate to the environment relations with distributors and retailers employment privacy health and trade practices our expanding international business will also expose us to economic factors regulatory requirements increasing competition and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries our international business are also subject to us laws regulations and policies including anticorruption and export laws and regulations 

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture safety sourcing labeling storing transportation advertising distribution and sale of our products could damage our reputation andor result in criminal civil or administrative actions with substantial financial penalties and operational limitations in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures or significant challenges to our ability to continue to produce and sell products that generate a significant portion of our sales and profits for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs in addition changes in legislation imposing tariffs on or restricting the importation of our products or raw materials required to make our products restricting the sale of kcup pod s requiring compostability of kcup pod s limiting the ability of consumers to put kcup pod s into municipal waste or recycling streams or requiring manufacturers of kcup pod s to pay socalled responsible producer or other fees to local or other governmental entities in connection with the collection recycling or disposition of kcup pod s could increase costs for us or at least for some period of time cut off a significant source of our sales and profits regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products such as california’s “prop 65” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects are or could become applicable to our products 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and may affect our ability to operate our business 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness including the indentures governing the 11975 million  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes the “notes” the credit agreement governing the current 2000 million term loan facility the “term loan facility” and the 2400 million  in revolving credit facilities the “revolving credit facilities” contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict our ability including certain subsidiaries to incur debt and our ability including certain subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions our ability including certain subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our future success depends upon the continued contributions of senior management and other key personnel and the ability to retain and motivate them if we are unable to retain and motivate the senior management team and other key personnel sufficiently to support the projected growth and initiatives of our business our business and financial performance may be adversely affected 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes and nonincomebased taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly andor annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law in addition tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate among other things a number of countries are considering changes to their tax laws applicable to multinational corporate groups such as the recently enacted us tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tcja” some foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the tcja that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and operating results moreover many of the new provisions of the tcja will need to be implemented through us department of treasury regulations and other guidance that could impact the interpretation and effect of these provisions changes in tax laws regulations related interpretations and tax accounting standards in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our financial results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in mexico and canada may adversely affect our operating results 

while our operations are predominately in the us we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales expenses profits assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso the canadian dollar as well as other foreign currencies in which we transact business we may continue to hedge a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing derivative instruments for certain transactions however we are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations 

as a result our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates moreover any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit gross margin and income from operations from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year 

we continue to be exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that we may not be able to manage through derivative instruments and may incur material losses from such transactions utilizing derivative instruments 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business   

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend against claims we cannot be certain that the steps it takes to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we will continue to license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries third parties own a particular trademark or other intellectual property that we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola outside north america adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license rights to distribute thirdparty products the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

from time to time we may be a party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings that may include employment tort real estate antitrust environmental intellectual property commercial securities false advertising product labeling consumer protection and other claims from time to time we may be a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling including under california’s “proposition 65” public statements and disclosures under securities laws antitrust advertising consumer protection and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts that are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we will base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost and any required actions arising out of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions   

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us canada mexico the caribbean or other geographies where we do business may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings we may be impacted by consumer price sensitivity associated with many of our products similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials additionally these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we also face counterparty risk for our cash investments and derivative instruments declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have programs of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we may continue to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

due to the seasonality of many of our products and other factors our operating results are subject to fluctuations 

historically we have experienced increased sales of the keurig brewing systems in our fourth quarter generally october through december due to the holiday season if sales of keurig brewing systems during the holiday season do not meet expectations sales of our kcup pod s throughout the remainder of the year will be negatively impacted the impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business in addition our operating results can be impacted by seasonal fluctuation as a result our quarterly operating results are subject to these same seasonality factors 

failure to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results 

in many countries including the us we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned and are taxed accordingly 

although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed 

in the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to our positions we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of us foreign tax credits because the laws and regulations governing us foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment we cannot be sure that we will in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future 

weather natural disasters climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather natural disasters or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel our ability to produce and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months or unusually warm weather during the winter months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns “global warming” concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we will operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging including kcup pod s and the disposal of kcup pod s cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

we also may be faced with water availability risks water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

we are also faced with the impact of decreased or shifting agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities such as coffee and tea which are important sources of ingredients for our products 

we rely on independent certification for a number of products loss of certification within our supply chain or as related to manufacturing processes could harm our business 

we rely on independent certification such as certifications of products as “organic” or “responsibly sourced” to differentiate some products from others we must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as certified the loss of any independent certifications could adversely affect our marketplace position which could harm our business

 item 2 properties 

we have two corporate headquarters located in burlington massachusetts and plano texas 

the following table summarizes our principal manufacturing plants and principal warehouse and distribution facilities by geography and reportable segment as of december 31 2018  



we believe our facilities are wellmaintained and adequate that they are being appropriately utilized and that they have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes the extent of utilization of such facilities varies based on seasonal demand for our products it is not possible to measure with any degree of certainty or uniformity the productive capacity and extent of utilization of these facilities we periodically review our space requirements and we look to consolidate and dispose or sublet facilities we no longer need as and when appropriate

comparison of total stockholder return

the graph assumes that 100 was invested on december 31 2013 with dividends reinvested quarterly the graph additionally assumes that the special cash dividend of   10375  which was declared and paid as a result of the dps merger  was reinvested in kdp  once shares resumed trading on july 10 2018

 seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our cold beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months while hot beverage sales are generally higher during the cooler months overall beverage sales can be influenced by the timing of holidays and weather fluctuations 

segments 

as of december 31 2018  we report our business in four operating segments 



  

volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates finished beverages pods or brewers 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume as concentrate case sales the unit of measurement for concentrate case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings 

concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases 

packaged beverages and latin america beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages and latin america beverages segments we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

appliance and kcup pod sales volume 

in our coffee systems segments we measure our sales volume as the number of appliances and the number of individual kcup pod s sold to our customers 

comparable results of operations 

as a result of the recent dps merger  in order for management to discuss our results on a comparable basis we prepared unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to illustrate the estimated effects of the dps merger  which was consummated on july 9 2018 based on the historical results of operations of dps and maple see supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information section at the end of managements discussion and analysis for further information on the assumptions used in the preparation of the financial information 

furthermore management believes that there are certain nongaap financial measures that allow management to evaluate our results trends and ongoing performance on a comparable basis in order to derive the adjusted financial information we adjust certain financial statement captions and metrics prepared on a pro forma basis for certain items affecting comparability see nongaap financial measures for further information on the certain items affecting comparability used in the preparation of the financial information these items are referred to within the adjusted pro forma results of operations   section which is located at the end of managements discussion and analysis discussion as adjusted pro forma net sales adjusted pro forma income from operations adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma diluted eps 

  

executive summary 

2018 financial overview 

 

net income attributable to kdp decreased 261 million  to 586 million  or 053  per diluted eps compared to 847 million  or 107  per diluted eps driven primarily by the unfavorable comparison of the income tax benefits related to the tcja in 2017 and the higher interest expense transaction costs and restructuring and integration charges associated with the dps merger partially offset by the incremental income from operations impact of the dps merger

interest expense   interest expense during 2018 was 401 million  or 54  of net sales due primarily to the increased borrowings and assumption of the existing senior unsecured notes as a result of the dps merger partially offset by the realized gains associated with the termination of receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps during the fourth quarter of 2018 

interest expense  related party   interest expense  related party during 2018 was 51 million  or 07  of net sales these related party loans were capitalized into additional paid in capital at the time of the dps merger and no longer incur any future interest expense

other income expense net   other income expense net in 2018 was a benefit of 19 million  primarily due to the distribution from bodyarmor which resulted in a gain of approximately 24 million compared to expense of 95 million  during the calendar year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to the termination of our cross currency swap on euro denominated debt during the period

liquidity and capital resources 

trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by all risk factors discussed in item 1a risk factors that could have a material effect on production delivery and consumption of our products in the us mexico and the caribbean or canada which could result in a reduction in our sales volume similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies as of december 31 2018  



 amounts excluded from our table 

as of december 31 2018  we had 62 million  of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits related interest and penalties classified as a longterm liability the table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment refer to note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for further information 

the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31 2018 was approximately 30 million  this amount is impacted by among other items funding levels plan amendments changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table abovethe pension protection act of 2006 was enacted in august 2006 and established among other things new standards for funding of us defined benefit pension plans we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations we did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above 

we have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities we did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control 

in general we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are selfinsured for large portions of many different types of claims our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs is estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history as of december 31 2018  our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs totaled approximately 94 million  

  

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 



  



  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we currently participate in three multiemployer pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan and us gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multiemployer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable refer to note 7 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements   for additional information regarding our multiemployer pension plans 

there are no other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding refer to note 8 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices from time to time we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge or mitigate commercial risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation investing or trading 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars however we have exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred as of december 31 2018  the impact to our income from operations of a 10 change up or down in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 31 million  on an annual basis 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2018  we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 348 million  maturing at various dates through september 25 2024  

interest rate risk 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio through the use of interest rate swaps and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as of december 31 2018  the carrying value of our fixedrate debt excluding capital lease obligations was 12019 million  and our variablerate debt was 3640 million  inclusive of commercial paper 

additionally as of december 31 2018  the total notional value of receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps was 1070 million  and the total notional value of receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps was 2125 million  

  

the following table is an estimate of the impact to our interest expense based upon our variable rate debt and derivative instruments and the fair value of the interest rate swaps that could result from hypothetical interest rate changes during the term of the financial instruments based on debt levels as of december 31 2018  



 commodity risks 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of coffee beans pet aluminum diesel fuel corn for high fructose corn syrup apple juice concentrate apples sucrose and natural gas for use in processing and packaging 

we utilize commodities derivative instruments and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2018  was a net liability of 31 million  

as of december 31 2018  the impact of a 10 change up or down in market prices for these commodities where the risk of movements has not been hedged is estimated to have a 15 million  impact to our income from operations for the year ended december 31 2018  

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rules 13a15b and 15d15b under the exchange act management with the participation of the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2018 for post dps merger  consolidated kdp  based upon that evaluation our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

report on internal controls over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap  

on july 9 2018 dps  and maple  completed the dps merger  and after giving effect to the dps merger  the stockholders of maple  as of immediately prior to the effective time  owned approximately 87  of kdp  common stock on a fully diluted basis following the closing and the stockholders of dps  as of immediately prior to the effective time  owned approximately 13  of kdp  common stock on a fully diluted basis following the closing dps  was the legal acquirer in the dps merger  maple  was the accounting acquirer in the dps merger  under us gaap  prior to the dps merger  maple  was a privatelyheld company and was not subject to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act “sox” while dps  was a publicly traded company subject to section 404 of sox for all filings under the exchange act after the dps merger  the historical financial statements of kdp  for the period prior to the dps merger  are and will be those of maple  dps ’s businesses are and will be included in kdp ’s financial statements for all periods subsequent to the dps merger  

as noted above dps  was the legal acquirer in the merger and subject to section 404 of sox as of the date of its report management was able to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our ongoing internal controls related to dps  as the dps merger  occurred during the third quarter of 2018 and maple  was the accounting acquirer and not previously subject to section 404 of sox management concluded there was insufficient time for management to complete its assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting related to maple  and therefore maple  internal controls over financial reporting were excluded from our report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management with the participation of the ceo and cfo assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting by focusing on those controls that relate exclusively to ongoing dps  operations covering approximately 45 of the revenue on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2018 and 3 of the total assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2018 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2018 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

attestation report of the independent registered public accounting firm 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp our independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their attestation report which is included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

as described in more detail under ‘report on internal controls over financial reporting’ above the dps merger  was completed on july 9 2018 which represented a change in internal control over financial reporting maple  was a privately held company prior to the dps merger  and therefore was not required to design or maintain its controls in accordance with exchange act rule 13a15 prior to the dps merger  while the majority of the operational control activities of dps  were not directly impacted by the dps merger  significant time and resources from our management and other personnel have been required and will continue to be required for the design and implementation of internal control over financial reporting for the post dps merger  consolidated kdp which will include the operations of maple  the ongoing operations of dps  and the final allocation of purchase price to dps  our management will continue to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as we execute the dps merger  integration activities 

in connection with the july 9 2018 dps merger  as of december 31 2018 the internal controls for dps  related to the processing and recording of certain transactions and the related it general controls remain essentially unchanged management from both dps  and maple  are continuing to consolidate and integrate kdp’s system of controls the processes and controls for significant areas including business combinations intangibles and goodwill valuations income taxes treasury consolidations and the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures and entity level controls have been substantially impacted by the ongoing integration activities the primary changes in these areas are related to the consolidation of process owner leadership and control owners and where required the modification of inputs processes and associated systems for all areas of change noted management believes the control design and implementation thereof are being appropriately modified to address underlying risks the above noted planned changes due to ongoing integration activities to kdp’s internal control over financial reporting are reasonably likely to materially affect kdp’s internal control over financial reporting in 2019 

other than changes that have and may continue to result from the integration activities noted above there have been no changes in kdp’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2018 that have materially affected or are reasonable likely to materially affect kdp’s internal control over financial reporting

our strengths 

  the key strengths of our business are 

strong portfolio of leading consumerpreferred brands   we own a diverse portfolio of wellknown csd and ncb brands many of our brands enjoy high levels of consumer awareness preference and loyalty rooted in their rich heritage which drive their market positions our diverse portfolio provides our bottlers distributors and retailers with a wide variety of products and provides us with a platform for growth and profitability according to iri retail sales we are th e  1  fla vored csd company in the us our largest brand dr pepper is the  2 f lavored csd in the us and our snapple brand is a leading readytodrink t ea overall in 2017  approximately 83  of our volume was generated by brands that hold either the 1 or 2 position in their category the strength of our significant brands has allowed us to launch innovations brand extensions or limited time offers 

  

integrated business model   our integrated business model provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses for example we can focus on maximizing profitability for our company as a whole rather than focusing on profitability generated from either the sale of beverage concentrates or the bottling and distribution of our products additionally our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage our manufacturing and distribution system in the us also enables us to improve focus on our brands especially certain brands such as 7up aw sunkist soda squirt snapple and hawaiian punch which do not have a large presence in the bottler systems affiliated with the cocacola company cocacola or pepsico inc pepsico 

strong customer relationships   our brands have enjoyed longstanding relationships with many of our top customers we sell our products to a wide range of customers from bottlers and distributors to national retailers large food service and convenience store customers we have strong relationships with some of the largest bottlers and distributors including those affiliated with cocacola and pepsico some of the largest and most important retailers including walmart store s inc walmart the kroger co albertson companies llc target corporation and publix super markets inc some of the largest food service customers including mcdonalds corporation restaurant brands international inc yum brands inc sonic corp the wendys company chickfila inc subway restaurants whataburger restaurants llc arbys group inc and jack in the box inc and conve nience store customers including 7eleven inc oxxo and circle k enterprises inc our portfolio of strong brands operational scale and experience across beverage segments has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with our customers 

attractive positioning within a large and profitable market   we hold the 1   position in the us flavored csd beverage markets by sales volume according to iri we are also a leader in the canada and mexico beverage markets our portfolio of products is biased toward flavored csds which continue to gain market share versus cola csds but also focuses on growing categories such as teas juices and enhanced and flavored water   

broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage   as of december 31 2017  we had 18  manufacturing facilities and 98  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in the us as well as four  manufacturing facilities and 21  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in mexico we have strategically located manufacturing and distribution capabilities enabling us to better align our operations with our customers reduce transportation costs and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches in addition our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and geographically dispersed to ensure our products are available to meet consumer demand we actively manage transportation of our products using our fleet owned and leased of approximately 6100  and 1700  vehicles in the us and mexico respectively and third party logistics providers on a selected basis 

as a result of our distribution capabilities we believe brand owners view us as a partner with a strong routetomarket in order to grow their allied brands in our packaged beverages segment these allied brand partnerships allow us to rapidly participate in growth in emerging and fast growing categories where we do not currently have a brand presence we typically make a minimal investment in each allied brand company in order to obtain a return for our distribution efforts 

strong operating margins and stable cash flows   the breadth of our brand portfolio has enabled us to generate strong operating margins which have delivered stable cash flows these cash flows enable us to consider a variety of alternatives such as acquisitions investing in our business repurchasing shares of our common stock paying dividends to our stockholders and reducing our debt   as a result of our stable cash flows we have been able to increase our dividends each year since 2010 in order to return more cash to our stockholders 

experienced executive management team   our executive management team has over   200 years of collective experience in the food and beverage industry the team has broad experience in brand ownership manufacturing and distribution and enjoys strong relationships both within the industry and with major customers in addition our management team has diverse skills that support our operating strategies including driving organic growth through targeted and efficient marketing improving productivity of our operations aligning manufacturing and distribution interests and executing strategic acquisitions 

our strategy 

the key elements of our business strategy are to 

build our brands   we have a welldefined portfolio strategy to allocate our marketing and sales resources we use an ongoing process of market and consumer analysis to identify key brands that we believe have the greatest potential for profitable sales growth we continue to invest most heavily in our priority brands to drive profitable and sustainable growth by strengthening consumer awareness innovating our brands to take advantage of evolving consumer trends improving distribution and increasing promotional effectiveness we also focus on new distribution agreements for emerging highgrowth third party brands in new categories that can use our manufacturing and distribution network we provide these new brands with distribution capability and resources to grow and they provide us with exposure to growing segments of the market with relatively low risk and capital investment 

execute with excellence we are focused on improving our product presence in high margin brands products and channels such as convenience stores vending machines and small independent retail outlets through increased selling activity we also intend to increase demand for high margin products like singleserve packages for many of our key brands through increased instore activity 

  

we believe our integrated brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business model provides us opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses we intend to continue leveraging our integrated business model to reduce costs by optimizing geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage and to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches 

strengthening our routetomarket will ensure the ongoing health of our brands we continue to invest in information technology it to improve route productivity and data integrity and standards with third party bottlers we continue to deliver programs that maintain priority for our brands in their systems

competition 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations such as cocacola and pepsico with significant financial resources 

  

we also compete against other large companies including nestlé sa nestle kraft foods group inc kraft foods and the campbell soup company campbell soup these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as the cott corporation cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets other bottlers and manufacturers could also expand their contract manufacturing we also have exposure to some of the faster growing noncarbonated and bottled water segments in the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

although these bottlers and distributors are our competitors several of these companies are also our customers as they purchase beverage concentrates from us

in connection with the transaction plaintiffs may file lawsuits against dps maple parent andor the directors and officers of either company in addition either company may face inquiries from governmental entities in connection with the transaction although we believe any such lawsuits would be meritless the outcome of such litigation or governmental inquiry is uncertain such legal proceedings or governmental inquiries could also prevent or delay the completion of the transaction and result in additional costs to us 

  

dps stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the transaction and will exercise less influence over management dps stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the dps board and on other matters affecting dps 

upon the consummation of the transaction each dps stockholder will remain a stockholder of dps with a percentage ownership of kdp following the transaction that is smaller than the stockholder’s prior percentage ownership of dps it is currently expected that the former stockholders of dps as a group immediately after the transaction will own approximately 13 of the outstanding shares of common stock of kdp on a fully diluted basis because of this dps stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of kdp than they now have on the management and policies of dps 

also see “ kdp will meet the requirements to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the nyse and as a result will qualify for and intends to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance standards which limit the presence of independent directors on its board of directors or board committees ” 

following the transaction the composition of the kdp board will be different than the composition of the current dps board 

upon consummation of the transaction the composition of the kdp board will be different than the current dps board the dps board currently consists of 9 directors upon the consummation of the transaction the kdp board will consist of 12 members 

 

this new composition of the board of directors of kdp may affect the future decisions of kdp 

kdp will meet the requirements to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the nyse and as a result will qualify for and intends to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance standards which limit the presence of independent directors on its board of directors or board committees 

following the transaction approximately 87 of the outstanding common stock of kdp will be held by holders of the equity interests of maple parent on a fully diluted basis and approximately 13 will be held by the stockholders of dps on a fully diluted basis 

as a result kdp will be a “controlled company” for purposes of section 303a of the nyse listed company manual and will be exempt from certain governance requirements otherwise required by the nyse under section 303a a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual a group or another company is a “controlled company” and is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements including requirements that 1 a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and 3 director nominees be selected or recommended for selection by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominatingcorporate governance committee composed solely of independent directors following the consummation of the transaction kdp will continue to have an audit committee that is composed entirely of independent directors 

as a result the procedures for approving significant corporate decisions could be determined by directors who have a direct or indirect interest in such decisions and kdp’s stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of other companies that are required to comply with the independence rules of the nyse 

the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the transaction may not be consummated the merger agreement contains provisions that restrict the ability of the dps board to pursue alternatives to the transaction and to change its recommendation that dps stockholders vote for the stockholder approvals in specified circumstances dps could be required to pay maple parent a termination fee of up to 700 million 

the merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time whether before or after receipt of the approval of dps’ stockholders or the effectiveness of the maple parent stockholder consent or merger sub stockholder consent by the mutual written consent of the parties by either maple parent or dps if stockholder or regulatory approvals are not obtained or by maple parent or dps in connection with certain breaches of the merger agreement by dps or maple parent respectively 

  

if the merger agreement is terminated by dps pursuant to accepting a superior acquisition proposal and entering into an alternative acquisition agreement by maple parent if our board changes its recommendation to stockholders to approve the issuance of the acquisition shares and amendment to the certificate of incorporation or by either dps or maple parent because the closing does not occur by october 29 2018 and there is an acquisition proposal outstanding at the time of such termination and within twelve months of termination of the merger agreement dps consummates or enters into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal dps shall pay to maple parent a termination fee in the amount of 700 million if the merger agreement is terminated by dps because maple parent is unable to obtain required financing on the terms required by the merger agreement maple parent shall pay to dps a reverse termination fee in the amount of 700 million 

failure to consummate the transaction could negatively impact dps and its future operations 

if the transaction is not consummated for any reason dps may be subjected to a number of material risks the price of shares of dps common stock may decline to the extent that its current market prices reflect a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated in addition some costs related to the transaction must be paid by dps whether or not the transaction is consummated furthermore dps may experience negative reactions from its stockholders customers and employees in the event the transaction is not consummated further dps management would have committed time financial and other resources to matters relating to the transaction that could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities for dps 

in addition if the transaction is not completed dps could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement the materialization of any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business 

dps and keurig will be subject to business uncertainties and certain operating restrictions until consummation of the transaction 

uncertainty about the effect of the transaction on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on dps keurig or kdp following the transaction these uncertainties could disrupt our business or the business of keurig and cause customers suppliers vendors partners and others that deal with us and keurig to defer entering into contracts with us and keurig or making other decisions concerning us and keurig or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us and keurig retention and motivation of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the transaction due to uncertainty about their future roles and difficulty of integration if key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with kdp kdp’s business following the transaction could be negatively impacted in addition the merger agreement restricts dps from making certain acquisitions and investments and imposes certain other restrictions on the conduct of each partys business until the transaction occurs without the consent of keurig these restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the transaction 

the merger agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pursue other alternatives to the transaction 

the merger agreement contains nonsolicitation provisions that subject to limited exceptions restrict our ability to initiate solicit knowingly encourage induce or assist any inquiries or the making submission announcement or consummation of proposals or offers that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal further subject to limited exceptions consistent with applicable law the merger agreement provides that our board will not withhold withdraw qualify or modify or publicly propose or resolve to withhold withdraw qualify or modify in a manner adverse to maple parent its recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of the stockholder approvals although our board is permitted to take certain actions in response to a superior proposal or an intervening event if it determines that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties doing so in specified situations could require us to pay to maple parent the termination fee 

such provisions could discourage a potential acquiror that might have an interest in making a proposal from considering or proposing any such transaction even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value to our stockholders than that to be paid in the transaction there also is a risk that the requirement to pay the termination fee or expense payment to maple parent in certain circumstances may result in a potential acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay 

if our due diligence investigation of keurig was inadequate or if unexpected risks related to keurigs business materialize it could have a material adverse effect on our stockholders investment 

even though we conducted a due diligence investigation of keurig we cannot be sure that our diligence surfaced all material issues that may be present inside keurig or its business or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence or that factors outside of keurig and its business and outside of its control will not arise later if any such material issues arise they may materially and adversely impact the ongoing business of kdp and our stockholders investment 

  

risks related to the business of the combined company 

expected combination benefits from the transaction may not be fullyrealized or realized within the expected time frame 

the ability of keurig and dps to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction will depend to a large extent on kdp’s ability to combine keurig’s and dps businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company it is expected that kdp will benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the warehouse and transportation integration direct procurement savings on overlapping materials purchasing scale on indirect spend categories and optimization of duplicate positions and processes kdp may also enjoy revenue synergies driven by a strong portfolio of brands with exposure to higher growth segments and the ability to leverage our collective distribution strength in order to achieve these expected benefits kdp must successfully combine the businesses of keurig and dps in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized and must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth if kdp experiences difficulties with the integration process or is not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

the businesses of dps and keurig may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult timeconsuming or costly than expected operating costs customer loss and business disruption including difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees customers clients or suppliers may be greater than expected following the transaction revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected 

the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result keurig and dps will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to combining their business practices and operations this process may disrupt the businesses the failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of kdp and could adversely affect the results of operations of kdp the overall combination of keurig’s and dps’ businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 

many of these factors are outside of the control of keurig and dps andor will be outside the control of kdp and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of kdp in addition even if the operations of the businesses of keurig and dps are combined successfully the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized including the synergies or sales or growth opportunities that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in combining the businesses of keurig and dps all of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of kdp decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of dps common stock as a result it cannot be assured that the combination of keurig and dps will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction within the anticipated time frames or at all 

  

if a credit rating downgrade below investment grade were to occur dps may be required to purchase its outstanding notes and may be unable to do so 

dps has a substantial amount of debt outstanding comprised of various series of outstanding notes these notes generally require dps to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior unsecured notes of each series at 101 of the principal amount thereof plus without duplication accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of repurchase should dps undergo a change of control and receive a credit rating downgrade below investment grade because the transaction will constitute a change of control of dps if any such series is rated below investment grade by moody’s investors service inc moodys and standard  poor’s financial services llc sp within the first 60 days following the effectiveness of the transaction dps will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior unsecured notes of each such series at 101 of the principal amount thereof plus without duplication accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of repurchase dps may not have sufficient funds including as a result of a failure to raise sufficient funds through the debt or equity markets to finance a required repurchase of such senior unsecured notes by dps the failure to finance or complete such an offer would place dps in default under the indentures governing the senior unsecured notes additionally if there is increased volatility or a disruption in the global capital and credit markets it could impair dps’s ability to access these markets for purposes of funding a required repurchase on commercially acceptable terms 

maple parent and dps will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the transaction maple parent and dps will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of consummating the transaction 

a portion of the transaction costs related to the transaction will be incurred regardless of whether the transaction is consummated while maple parent and dps have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred factors beyond maple parent’s and dps’ control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately these expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by maple parent and dps these costs could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of maple parent and dps prior to the transaction and of kdp following the transaction 

the agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the transaction may contain various covenants that impose restrictions on kdp and certain of its subsidiaries that may affect its ability to operate its businesses 

the agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the transaction will contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict the ability of kdp and certain of its subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of kdp and certain of its subsidiaries to among other things have liens on their property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of their assets to any one person and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions the ability of kdp and its subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate its repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances kdp might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations 

the transaction will expose us to risks inherent in the coffee and appliances business and risks inherent in those geographies where keurig currently operates 

if consummated successfully the transaction would represent a significant transformation of our existing business upon completion of the transaction we would be subject to a variety of risks associated with the coffee and small appliances business in addition to those we already face in the lrb industry these risks include changes in consumer preferences volatility in the prices of raw materials consumer perceptions of the brands competition in the retail market place and other risks in addition we will be exposed to risks inherent in operating in geographies in which we have not operated in or have been less present in the past 

  

risks related to our current dps business 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors 

consumers preferences can change due to a variety of factors including the age and ethnic demographics of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds and the use of natural organic or simple ingredients in lrb products as such the demand for csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences and quickly develop new products or partner with an allied brand in that category in response then our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

approximately   82   of our   2017   packaged beverages net sales of branded products came from our owned and licensed brands and our contract manufacturing with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as but not limited to   fiji mineral water big red bodyarmor vita coco coconut water arizona tea core hydration neuro drinks high brew hydrive energy drinks and sparkling fruit 2 o  we are subject to a risk of our allied brands terminating their distribution agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance within each distribution agreement we have certain protections in case the allied brands terminate the distribution agreements including a onetime termination payment 

costs for commodities such as raw materials and energy may change substantially 

the principal raw materials we use in our products are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas 

price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers price increases we pass along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance furthermore price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for marktomarket changes in the derivative instruments 

new or proposed beverage taxes or regulations could impact our sales 

over the years the federal state and local governments of the us and the federal government of mexico have imposed or attempted to impose indirect taxes on the manufacturing andor the distribution of certain sugarsweetened beverages which are commonly referred to as a beverage tax or sugar tax these regressive taxes were primarily the result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity   as federal state and local governments in the us and foreign governments experience significant budget deficits some lawmakers continue to single out beverages among a number of revenueraising items as such federal state and other local and foreign governments could continue to seek to impose a beverage or sugar tax additionally local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types or sizes of soft drinks in municipalities and schools as a result of these concerns any changes of regulations or imposed taxes may reduce consumer demand for our products or could cause us to raise our prices both of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and negatively affect our business and financial performance   

if we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses or brands our operating results may adversely be affected 

from time to time we acquire businesses such as bai brands or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and distribution rights we may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with the acquisition integration or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures we may also experience delays in extending our internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements our financial performance depends in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands we cannot assure you however that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such acquisitions if we are unable to achieve such objectives our consolidated results could be negatively affected 

  

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segments operations generate a significant portion of our overall segment operating profit sop some of these bottlers such as pepsico and cocacola are also our competitors the majority of these bottlers business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass price increases through to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance   

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience brand recognition can also be impacted by   the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which represent approximately   424  o f the us lrb market by retail sales according to iri we also compete against other large companies including nestle kraft foods and campbell soup these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products changing their route to market reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers we have lower exposure to nonpremium bottled water and readytodrink coffee compared to the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

if we are unable to compete effectively our sales could decline as a result we would potentially reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  we had 10022 million  of total assets of which approximately 7342 million  were goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinitelived intangible assets in connection with brands distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we recognized approximately 1 million in impairment charges for our aguafiel brand based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of october 1 2017  for additional information about these intangible assets see critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and note 2  and note 4  to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

  

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances some of which are beyond our control factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products andor the product category ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events and v changes in our discount rates since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate 

our total indebtedness excluding capital lease obligations could affect our operations and profitability 

we maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our actual and expected cash flows as of   december 31 2017  our total indebtedness was   4479 million  

this amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including   requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions which could impact our debt maturity profile 

while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control 

in assessing our credit strength credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as our results of operations and financial position at that time if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength the credit agencies perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our current or future results of operations and financial position or for any other reason our cost of borrowing could increase 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in mexico and canada may adversely affect our operating results 

while our operations are predominately in the us we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales expenses profits assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso or the canadian dollar we manage a small portion of our exposure to the canadian dollar and mexican peso for certain transactions utilizing derivative instruments and are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations as a result our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates moreover any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit gross margin income from operations or segment operating profit from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year 

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various benefitrelated accounting and transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information disrupting business processes or corrupting information these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets litigation remediation costs damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event which could adversely affect our business 

increases in our cost of benefits in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs increases in participants enrolled declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

  

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us canada mexico or the caribbean may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials additionally these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of   unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedging arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings which may include employment tort real estate commercial and other litigation from time to time we are a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts which are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners fruit juice and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability cybersecurity attacks and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation or supply interruption government regulation cybersecurity attacks or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may fail to comply with applicable government laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see regulatory matters in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations 

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture safety labeling transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing   certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products  such as californias prop 65 which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects are or could become applicable to our products 

  

weather natural disasters climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather natural disasters or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the demand for our products our ability to produce our products and the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns global warming concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

we also may be faced with water availability risks water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may not meet these standards or could become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls liability claims and negative publicity moreover negative publicity also could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly andor annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law in addition tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 7500  of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see intellectual property and trademarks in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of these trademarks or negatively impact our brands

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have key person life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees

overview 

we are a leading integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the us canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored noncola csds and ncbs including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks water and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper canada dry peñafiel squirt 7up crush aw sunkist soda and schweppes and ncb brands such as snapple hawaiian punch motts clamato bai mr  mrs t mixers and roses our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the us according to iri we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers 

we operate as an integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor through our three segments we believe our integrated business model strengthens our routetomarket and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our dsd system and our wd delivery system our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage 

we operate primarily in the us mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2017  90  of our net sales were generated in the us 7  in mexico and the caribbean and 3  in canada 

uncertainties and trends affecting our business 

we believe the north american lrb market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties some of these items such as increased health consciousness and changes in consumer preferences and economic factors have created category headwinds for a number of our products during recent years the key trends and uncertainties that could affect our business include 



  

 refer to item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company 

seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

segments 

as of december 31 2017 we report our business in four operating segments 

 

the company has determined that packaged beverages excluding bai and bai which have been identified as operating segments meet the aggregation criteria under us gaap as such these segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment packaged beverages based on similarities among the operating units including economic characteristics the nature of the products and services the nature of the production processes the types or class of customer for their products and services the methods used to distribute their products and services and the nature of the regulatory environment 

  

volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 concentrate case sales and 2 bottler case sales the unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings 

concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases 

although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels 

packaged beverages and latin america beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages and latin america beverages segments we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

volume in bottler case sales 

in addition to sales volume we measure volume in bottler case sales volume bcs as sales of packaged beverages in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume bcs 

bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31 2017  was approximately 17 million  this amount is impacted by among other items funding levels plan amendments changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above

critical accounting estimates

commodity risks 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of resin for pet aluminum diesel fuel corn for high fructose corn syrup apple juice concentrate apples sucrose and natural gas for use in processing and packaging 

we utilize commodities forward and future contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2017  was a net asset  of 44 million  

as of december 31 2017  the impact of a 10 change up or down in market prices for these commodities where the risk of adverse movements has not been hedged is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 21 million  to our income from operations for the year ending december 31 2018

 item 1a  risk factors 

risks related to our business 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties could harm our business and financial condition   

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors 

consumers preferences can change due to a variety of factors including the age and ethnic demographics of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds and the use of natural organic or simple ingredients in lrb products as such the demand for csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences and quickly develop new products or partner with an allied brand in that category in response then our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience brand recognition can also be impacted by   the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which represent approximately   433  o f the us lrb market by retail sales according to iri we also compete against other large companies including nestle kraft foods and campbell soup these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products changing their route to market reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers we have lower exposure to energy drinks some of the faster growing ncbs and the bottled water segments in the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

if we are unable to compete effectively our sales could decline as a result we would potentially reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

  

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segments operations generate a significant portion of our overall segment operating profit sop some of these bottlers such as pepsico and cocacola are also our competitors the majority of these bottlers business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass price increases through to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance   

our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

approximately   85   of our   2016   packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our owned and licensed brands and our contract manufacturing with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as but not limited to big red   fiji mineral water bai brands arizona tea vita coco coconut water body armor neuro drinks core hydration sparkling fruit 2 o hydrive energy drinks and high brew  we are subject to a risk of our allied brands other than bai brands terminating their distribution agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance within each distribution agreement we have certain protections in case the allied brands terminate the distribution agreements including a onetime termination payment 

costs for commodities such as raw materials and energy may change substantially 

the principal raw materials we use in our products are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas 

price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers price increases we pass along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance furthermore price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for marktomarket changes in the derivative instruments 

new or proposed beverage taxes or regulations could impact our sales 

during 2013 the government of mexico enacted broad based tax reform including a one peso per liter tax on the manufacturing of certain sugarsweetened and other beverages which went into effect january 1 2014 since 2014 a number of local governments within the us including philadelphia san francisco and cooke county illinois have imposed taxes on the distribution of certain sugarsweetened beverages these regressive taxes were primarily the result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity federal state and other local and foreign governments could also impose taxes on sugarsweetened beverages as a result of these concerns additionally local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types or sizes of soft drinks in municipalities and schools as a result of these concerns any changes of regulations or imposed taxes may reduce consumer demand for our products or could cause us to raise our prices both of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and negatively affect our business and financial performance 

  

if we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses or brands our operating results may adversely be affected 

from time to time we acquire businesses such as bai brands or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and distribution rights we may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with the acquisition integration or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures we may also experience delays in extending our internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements our financial performance depends in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands we cannot assure you however that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such acquisitions if we are unable to achieve such objectives our consolidated results could be negatively affected 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2016  we had 9791 million  of total assets of which approximately 5649 million  were goodwill and other intangible assets on january 31 2017  we completed the bai brands merger with a preliminary purchase price of 1649 million net of our previous ownership interest of which we expect a significant portion of the consideration will be allocated to goodwill and intangible assets further increasing these amounts intangible assets include both definite and indefinitelived intangible assets in connection with brands distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess there were no impairment charges required based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of october 1 2016  for additional information about these intangible assets see critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and note 2 and note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances some of which are beyond our control factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products andor the product category ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events and v changes in our discount rates since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate 

our total indebtedness excluding capital lease obligations could affect our operations and profitability 

we maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our actual and expected cash flows as of december 31 2016  our total indebtedness was 4478 million  which includes the financing for the bai brands merger 

this amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including 

 while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed that will depend upon 



  

in assessing our credit strength credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as our results of operations and financial position at that time if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength the credit agencies perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our current or future results of operations and financial position or for any other reason our cost of borrowing could increase 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in mexico and canada may adversely affect our operating results 

while our operations are predominately in the us we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales expenses profits assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso or the canadian dollar we manage a small portion of our exposure to the canadian dollar and mexican peso for certain transactions utilizing derivative instruments and are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations as a result our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates moreover any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit gross margin income from operations or segment operating profit from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us canada mexico or the caribbean may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials additionally these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of   unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedging arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various benefitrelated accounting and transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information disrupting business processes or corrupting information these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets litigation remediation costs damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event which could adversely affect our business 

increases in our cost of benefits in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

  

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings which may include employment tort real estate commercial and other litigation from time to time we are a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts which are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners fruit juice and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability cybersecurity attacks and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation or supply interruption government regulation cybersecurity attacks or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may fail to comply with applicable government laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see regulatory matters in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations 

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture safety labeling transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing   certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products  such as californias prop 65 which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects are or could become applicable to our products 

weather climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

  

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns global warming concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

we also may be faced with water availability risks water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may not meet these standards or could become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls liability claims and negative publicity moreover negative publicity also could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly andor annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law in addition tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

as of   december 31 2016  approximately   6000  of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see intellectual property and trademarks in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of these trademarks or negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license products from third parties that we distribute the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

  

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we expect to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have key person life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees

references in the following discussion to we our us dps or the company refer to dr pepper snapple group inc and all entities included in our audited consolidated financial statements 

the periods presented in this section are the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  which we refer to as  2016   2015  and  2014  respectively 

overview 

we are a leading integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the us canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored noncola csds and ncbs including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks water and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper canada dry peñafiel squirt 7up crush aw sunkist soda and schweppes and ncb brands such as snapple hawaiian punch motts clamato bai brands mr  mrs t mixers and roses our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the us according to iri we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers   

we operate as an integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor through our three segments we believe our integrated business model strengthens our routetomarket and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our dsd system and our wd delivery system our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage 

we operate primarily in the us mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2016  90  of our net sales were generated in the us 7  in mexico and the caribbean and 3  in canada 

uncertainties and trends affecting our business 

we believe the north american lrb market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties some of these items such as increased health consciousness and changes in economic factors have created category headwinds for our csds during recent years the key trends and uncertainties that could affect our business include 



  

 as a result of these uncertainties and other factors we currently believe the following guidance for the year ending december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  

 refer to item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company 

seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

segments 

we report our business in three operating segments 

 segment results are based on management reports net sales and sop are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of our operating segments 

  

volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 concentrate case sales and 2 bottler case sales the unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings 

concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases 

although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels 

packaged beverages and latin america beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages and latin america beverages segments we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

volume in bottler case sales 

in addition to sales volume we measure volume in bottler case sales volume bcs as sales of packaged beverages in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume bcs 

bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31 2016  was approximately 39 million this amount is impacted by among other items funding levels plan amendments changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we currently participate in three multiemployer pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan and us gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multiemployer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable there are no other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding 

refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit 

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of these and other accounting policies

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices from time to time we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge or mitigate commercial risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation investment or trading 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars however we have exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred as of december 31 2016  the impact to our income from operations of a 10 change up or down in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 22 million  on an annual basis 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2016  we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 7 million  maturing at various dates through april 13 2017 

interest rate risk

commodity risks 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of pet aluminum diesel fuel corn for high fructose corn syrup apple juice concentrate apples sucrose and natural gas for use in processing and packaging 

we utilize commodities forward and future contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2016  was a net asset  of 20 million  

as of december 31 2016  the impact of a 10 change up or down in market prices for these commodities where the risk of adverse movements has not been hedged is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 6 million  to our income from operations for the year ending december 31 2017

our strengths 

  the key strengths of our business are 

strong portfolio of leading consumerpreferred brands   we own a diverse portfolio of wellknown csd and ncb brands many of our brands enjoy high levels of consumer awareness preference and loyalty rooted in their rich heritage which drive their market positions our diverse portfolio provides our bottlers distributors and retailers with a wide variety of products and provides us with a platform for growth and profitability according to nielsen retail sales we are th e  1  fla vored csd company in the us our largest brand dr pepper is the  2 f lavored csd in the us and our snapple brand is a leading readytodrink t ea overall in 2015  approximately 84  of our volume was generated by brands that hold either the 1 or 2 position in their category the strength of our significant brands has allowed us to launch innovations brand extensions or limited time offers such as our snapple straight up tea and seasonal limited time offerings hawaiian punch singleserve pouches peñafiel strawberryade mott’s tropical banana applesauce and juice drink lines in   2015  

integrated business model   our integrated business model provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses for example we can focus on maximizing profitability for our company as a whole rather than focusing on profitability generated from either the sale of beverage concentrates or the bottling and distribution of our products additionally our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage our manufacturing and distribution system in the us also enables us to improve focus on our brands especially certain brands such as 7up aw sunkist soda squirt rc cola hawaiian punch and snapple which do not have a large presence in the bottler systems affiliated with the cocacola company cocacola or pepsico inc pepsico 

strong customer relationships   our brands have enjoyed longstanding relationships with many of our top customers we sell our products to a wide range of customers from bottlers and distributors to national retailers large food service and convenience store customers we have strong relationships with some of the largest bottlers and distributors including those affiliated with cocacola and pepsico some of the largest and most important retailers including walmart store s inc walmart the kroger co safeway inc target corporation and publix super markets inc some of the largest food service customers including mcdonalds corporation yum brands inc burger king corp sonic corp the wendys company chickfila inc jack in the box inc subway restaurants arbys group inc and whataburger restaurants llc and conve nience store customers including 7eleven inc circle k enterprises inc and oxxo our portfolio of strong brands operational scale and experience across beverage segments has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with our customers 

  

attractive positioning within a large and profitable market   we hold the 1   position in the us flavored csd beverage markets by sales volume according to nielsen we are also a leader in the canada and mexico beverage markets our portfolio of products is biased toward flavored csds which continue to gain market share versus cola csds but also focuses on growing categories such as teas and juices   we believe marketing and product innovations that target fast growing population segments such as the hispanic community in the us could drive market growth 

broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage   as of   december 31 2015  we had   19  manufacturing facilities and 101  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in the us as well as three  manufacturing facilities and 12  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in mexico in december 2015 we began construction on a new manufacturing facility in mexico which is not reflected in the numbers above we have strategically located manufacturing and distribution capabilities enabling us to better align our operations with our customers reduce transportation costs and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches in addition our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and geographically dispersed to ensure our products are available to meet consumer demand we actively manage transportation of our products using our fleet owned and leased of approximately   7000   and   1500   vehicles in the us and mexico respectively and third party logistics providers on a selected basis as a result of our distribution capabilities we believe brand owners view us as a partner with a strong routetomarket in order to grow their allied brand in our packaged beverages segment 

strong operating margins and stable cash flows   the breadth of our brand portfolio has enabled us to generate strong operating margins which have delivered stable cash flows these cash flows enable us to consider a variety of alternatives such as investing in our business repurchasing shares of our common stock paying dividends to our stockholders and reducing our debt   as a result of our stable cash flows and the reduction of our capital expenditures we have been able to increase our dividends each year since 2010 in order to return more cash to our stockholders 

experienced executive management team   our executive management team has over   200 years of collective experience in the food and beverage industry the team has broad experience in brand ownership manufacturing and distribution and enjoys strong relationships both within the industry and with major customers in addition our management team has diverse skills that support our operating strategies including driving organic growth through targeted and efficient marketing improving productivity of our operations aligning manufacturing and distribution interests and executing strategic acquisitions 

our strategy 

  the key elements of our business strategy are to 

build our brands   we have a welldefined portfolio strategy to allocate our marketing and sales resources we use an ongoing process of market and consumer analysis to identify key brands that we believe have the greatest potential for profitable sales growth we continue to invest most heavily in our key brands to drive profitable and sustainable growth by strengthening consumer awareness innovating against our brands to take advantage of evolving consumer trends improving distribution and increasing promotional effectiveness we also focus on new distribution agreements for emerging highgrowth third party brands in new categories that can use our manufacturing and distribution network we provide these new brands with distribution capability and resources to grow and they provide us with exposure to growing segments of the market with relatively low risk and capital investment 

execute with excellence we are focused on improving our product presence in high margin brands products and channels such as convenience stores vending machines and small independent retail outlets through increased selling activity we also intend to increase demand for high margin products like singleserve packages for many of our key brands through increased instore activity 

we believe our integrated brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business model provides us opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses we intend to continue leveraging our integrated business model to reduce costs by optimizing geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage and to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches 

strengthening our routetomarket will ensure the ongoing health of our brands we continue to invest in information technology it to improve route productivity and data integrity and standards with third party bottlers we continue to deliver programs that maintain priority for our brands in their systems 

  

rapid continuous improvement   we have been able to create multiproduct manufacturing facilities which provide a region with a wide variety of our products at reduced transportation and copacking costs in 2011 we adopted our rapid continuous improvement rci which uses lean and six sigma methods to deliver customer value and improve productivity we believe rci is a means to achieve revenue and net income growth and increase the amount of cash returned to our stockholders

consumers preferences can change due to a variety of factors including the age and ethnic demographics of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds and the use of natural organic or simple ingredients in lrb products as such the demand for csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences and quickly develop new products or partner with an allied brand in that category in response then our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience brand recognition can also be impacted by   the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which represent approximately   46  o f the us lrb market by retail sales according to nielsen we also compete against other large companies including nestle kraft foods and campbell soup these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products changing their route to market reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers we have lower exposure to energy drinks some of the faster growing ncbs and the bottled water segments in the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

if we are unable to compete effectively our sales could decline as a result we would potentially reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

  

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segments operations generate a significant portion of our overall segment operating profit sop some of these bottlers such as pepsico and cocacola are also our competitors the majority of these bottlers business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance   

costs for commodities such as raw materials and energy may change substantially 

the principal raw materials we use in our products are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas 

price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers price increases we pass along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance furthermore price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for marktomarket changes in the derivative instruments 

new or proposed beverage taxes or regulations could impact our sales 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 the government of mexico enacted broad based tax reform including a one peso per liter tax on the manufacturing of certain sugarsweetened beverages which went into effect january 1 2014 as a result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity during the fourth quarter of 2014 the city of berkeley california enacted a one cent per ounce tax on the distribution of certain sugarsweetened beverages which went into effect march 1 2015 federal state and other local and foreign governments could also impose taxes on sugarsweetened beverages as a result of these concerns additionally local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types or sizes of soft drinks in municipalities and schools as a result of these concerns any changes of regulations or imposed taxes may reduce consumer demand for our products or could cause us to raise our prices both of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and negatively affect our business and financial performance 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2015  we had 8869 million  of total assets of which approximately 5651 million  were goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinitelived intangible assets in connection with brands distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we recorded a 7 million impairment charge for our garden cocktail brand as of october 1 2015 there was no other impairment charge required based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of october 1 2015  for additional information about these intangible assets see critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and note 2 and 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

  

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances some of which are beyond our control factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products andor the product category ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events and v changes in our discount rates since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in mexico and canada may adversely affect our operating results 

while our operations are predominately in the us we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales expenses profits assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso or the canadian dollar we manage a small portion of our exposure to the canadian dollar for certain transactions utilizing derivative instruments and are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations as a result our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates moreover any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit gross margin income from operations or segment operating profit from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us canada mexico or the caribbean may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials additionally these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of   unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedging arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

our total indebtedness excluding capital lease obligations could affect our operations and profitability 

we maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our actual and expected cash flows as of december 31 2015  our total indebtedness was 3382 million  

this amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including 

 while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control 

increases in our cost of benefits in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

  

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various benefitrelated accounting and transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information disrupting business processes or corrupting information these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets litigation remediation costs damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event which could adversely affect our business 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings which may include employment tort real estate commercial and other litigation from time to time we are a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts which are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners fruit juice and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability cybersecurity attacks and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation or supply interruption government regulation cybersecurity attacks or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may fail to comply with applicable government laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see regulatory matters in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations 

  

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture safety labeling transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing   certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products  such as californias prop 65 which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects are or could become applicable to our products 

weather climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns global warming concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

we also may be faced with water availability risks water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may not meet these standards or could become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls liability claims and negative publicity moreover negative publicity also could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly andor annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law in addition tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

as of   december 31 2015  approximately   6000  of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

  

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see intellectual property and trademarks in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of these trademarks or negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license products from third parties that we distribute the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we expect to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

approximately   81   of our   2015   packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our owned and licensed brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as but not limited to big red   fiji mineral water arizona tea vita coco coconut water bai brands neuro drinks sparkling fruit 2 o body armor and hydrive energy drinks  we are subject to a risk of our allied brands terminating their distribution agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have key person life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees

the periods presented in this section are the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  which we refer to as  2015   2014  and  2013  respectively 

overview 

we are a leading integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the us canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored noncola csds and ncbs including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks water and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper canada dry peñafiel squirt 7up crush aw sunkist soda and schweppes and ncb brands such as snapple hawaiian punch motts clamato mr  mrs t mixers and roses our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the us according to nielsen we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers   

we operate as an integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor through our three segments we believe our integrated business model strengthens our routetomarket and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our dsd system and our wd delivery system our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage 

we operate primarily in the us mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2015  89  of our net sales were generated in the us 8  in mexico and the caribbean and 3  in canada 

uncertainties and trends affecting our business 

we believe the north american lrb market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties some of these items such as increased health consciousness and changes in economic factors have created category headwinds for our csds during recent years the key trends and uncertainties that could affect our business include 

 24 

  

 as a result of these uncertainties and other factors we believe net sales for the year ending december 31 2016 could increase approxima tely 1 as co mpared to the year ended december 31 2015 while commodity costs for the year ending december 31 2016 are expected to be flat  on a constant volumemix basis as c ompared to the year ended december 31 2015 

refer to item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company 

seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

segments 

we report our business in three operating segments 

 segment results are based on management reports net sales and sop are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of our operating segments 

  

volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 concentrate case sales and 2 bottler case sales the unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings 

concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases 

although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels 

packaged beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages segment we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

volume in bottler case sales 

in addition to sales volume we measure volume in bottler case sales volume bcs as sales of packaged beverages in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume bcs 

bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

net sales   net sales increased 124 million or approximately 2 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the year ended december 31 2013 the primary drivers of the increase were favorable product and package mix increased branded sales volume higher pricing driven by the mexican sugar tax and an increase in contract manufacturing these drivers were partially offset by 35 million in unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher discounts driven primarily by the annual trueup of our prior year estimated customer liability

the favorable marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts for the year ended december 31 2014 was 11 million in unrealized gains versus 15 million in unrealized losses in the prior year the unfavorable comparison in our lifo inventory provision was the result of a 3 million increase in the provision for the year ended december 31 2014 versus a 39 million decrease in the provision for the year ended december 31 2013 driven primarily by apple prices 

sga  expenses   sga  expenses increased 62 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the prior year the increase was primarily driven by the following items 

 for the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized 24 million in unrealized losses related to the marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts versus 1 million in unrealized losses in the year ago period 

these items were partially offset by a planned reduction of 13 million for our marketing investments the favorable impact of foreign currency and the favorable comparison of the 7 million in workforce reduction costs related to certain restructuring activities in the prior year 

multiemployer pension plan withdrawal we recognized a noncash charge of 56 million related to our withdrawal from local 710 during the year ended december 31 2013 refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on this charge 

income from operations income from operations increased 134 million to 1180 million for the year ended december 31 2014 due primarily to the increase in gross profit and the favorable comparison to the noncash charge for the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal taken in the prior year partially offset by an increase in our sga expenses 

interest expense interest expense decreased 14 million or approximately 11 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the year ago period primarily due to the favorable impact of our fair value hedges and the repayment of our 612 senior unsecured notes in may 2013 

other expense income net and provision benefit for income taxes   through the second quarter of 2013 we recorded indemnification income from mondelēz under the tax indemnity agreement as other expense income net in the consolidated statements of income due to the completion of the irs audit for our 20062008 federal income tax returns in august 2013 we recognized an income tax benefit of 463 million primarily related to decreasing our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and 430 million of other expense net as we no longer anticipate collecting amounts from mondelēz in june 2013 a bill was enacted by the canadian government which reduced amounts amortized for income tax purposes as a result we recognized 38 million of indemnity income due to the reduction of our longterm liability to mondelēz and 50 million of income tax expense for the reduction of our tax assets 

the following table excludes these amounts discussed above from our other expense income net income before provision benefit for income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and provision benefit for income taxes lines within our consolidated statements of income we have presented this table as we believe the effect of those items on these lines and on our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 are not meaningful as reported

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of these and other accounting policies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices from time to time we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge or mitigate commercial risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation investment or trading 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars however we have exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred as of december 31 2015  the impact to our income from operations of a 10 change up or down in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 22 million  on an annual basis 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2015  we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 7 million  maturing at various dates through june 15 2016 

interest rate risk 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio through the use of interest rate swaps and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variable rate debt as of december 31 2015  the carrying value of our fixedrate debt excluding capital leases was 3246 million  720 million  of which is designated as fair value hedges and exposed to variability in interest rates 

  

the following table is an estimate of the impact to the fair value hedges that could result from hypothetical interest rate changes during the term of the financial instruments based on debt levels as of december 31 2015  



 

 commodity risks 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of pet aluminum diesel fuel corn for high fructose corn syrup apple juice concentrate apples sucrose and natural gas for use in processing and packaging 

we utilize commodities forward and future contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2015  was a net liability  of 31 million  

as of december 31 2015  the impact of a 10 change up or down in market prices for these commodities where the risk of adverse movements has not been hedged is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 13 million  to our income from operations for the year ending december 31 2016

integrated business model   our integrated business model provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses for example we can focus on maximizing profitability for our company as a whole rather than focusing on profitability generated from either the sale of beverage concentrates or the bottling and distribution of our products additionally our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage our manufacturing and distribution system in the us also enables us to improve focus on our brands especially certain brands such as 7up sunkist soda aw squirt rc cola hawaiian punch and snapple which do not have a large presence in the bottler systems affiliated with the cocacola company cocacola or pepsico inc pepsico 

strong customer relationships   our brands have enjoyed longstanding relationships with many of our top customers we sell our products to a wide range of customers from bottlers and distributors to national retailers large food service and convenience store customers we have strong relationships with some of the largest bottlers and distributors including those affiliated with cocacola and pepsico some of the largest and most important retailers including walmart store s inc walmart the kroger co supervalu inc safeway inc publix super markets inc and target corporation some of the largest food service customers including mcdonalds corporation yum brands inc burger king corp sonic corp the wendys company subway restaurants jack in the box inc chickfila inc whataburger restaurants llc and arbys group inc and conve nience store customers including 7eleven inc circle k enterprises inc and oxxo our portfolio of strong brands operational scale and experience across beverage segments has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with our customers

broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage   as of   december 31 2014  we had   19  manufacturing facilities and 106  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in the us as well as two  manufacturing facilities and 12  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in mexico these facilities use a variety of manufacturi ng processes we have strategically located manufacturing and distribution capabilities enabling us to better align our operations with our customers reduce transportation costs and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches in addition our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and geographically dispersed to ensure our products are available to meet consumer demand we actively manage transportation of our products using our own fleet of approximately   4500   and 1500 vehicles in the us and mexico respectively and third party logistics providers on a selected basis 

strong operating margins and stable cash flows   the breadth of our brand portfolio has enabled us to generate strong operating margins which have delivered stable cash flows these cash flows enable us to consider a variety of alternatives such as investing in our business repurchasing shares of our common stock paying dividends to our stockholders and reducing our debt   as a result of our stable cash flows and the reduction of our capital expenditures we have been able to increase our dividends each year in order to return more cash to our stockholders 

experienced executive management team   our executive management team has over   200 years of collective experience in the food and beverage industry the team has broad experience in brand ownership manufacturing and distribution and enjoys strong relationships both within the industry and with major customers in addition our management team has diverse skills that support our operating strategies including driving organic growth through targeted and efficient marketing improving productivity of our operations aligning manufacturing and distribution interests and executing strategic acquisitions 

our strategy

execute with excellence we are focused on improving our product presence in high margin channels such as convenience stores vending machines and small independent retail outlets through increased selling activity and repositioning our investments in coolers and other cold drink equipment to locations that provide a better return on our investment we also intend to increase demand for high margin products like singleserve packages for many of our key brands through increased instore activity

as of   december 31 2014  our distribution network consisted of   106  principal distribution centers and warehouses in the us and   12  principal distribution centers and warehouses in mexico our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and are geographically dispersed to ensure product is available to meet consumer demand we actively manage the sale merchandising and transportation of our products using a combination of our own fleet of approximately   4500  and 1500   vehicles in the us and mexico respectively and third party logistics providers on a selected basis 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially in addition we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses 

under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process through the use of forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of shortterm predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position 

manufacturing costs for our packaged beverages segment where we manufacture and bottle finished beverages are higher as a percentage of our net sales than our beverage concentrates segment as the packaged beverages segment requires the purchase of a much larger portion of the packaging and ingredients although we have contracts with a relatively small number of suppliers we have generally not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required amount of raw materials 

research and development 

our research and development team is composed of scientists and engineers in the us and mexico who are focused on developing high quality products which have broad consumer appeal can be sold at competitive prices and can be safely and consistently produced across a diverse manufacturing network our research and development team engages in activities relating to product development microbiology analytical chemistry process engineering sensory science nutrition knowledge management and regulatory compliance we have particular expertise in flavors and sweeteners which allows us to focus our research in areas of importance to the industry such as new sweetener development   research and development costs are expensed when incurred and amounted to 18 million  21 million  and 21 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively these expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 

information technology 

we use a variety of it systems and networks configured to meet our business needs our primary it data center is hosted in toronto canada by a third party provider we also use a third party vendor for application support and maintenance which is based in india and provides resources offshore and onshore 

employees 

at   december 31 2014  we employed approximately   19000 e mployees 

in the us we have approximately   16000   fulltime employees we have union collective bargaining agreements covering approximately   4000   fulltime employees several agreements cover multiple locations these agreements address working conditions as well as wage rates and benefits in mexico and the caribbean we employ approximately   3000 fu lltime employees with approximately   2000   employees party to collective bargaining agreements we do not have a significant number of employees in canada 

we believe we have good relations with our employees 

  

regulatory matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business regulations apply to many aspects of our business including our products and their ingredients manufacturing safety labeling transportation recycling advertising and sale for example our products and their manufacturing labeling marketing and sale in the us are subject to various aspects of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal trade commission act the lanham act state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws in canada and mexico the manufacture distribution marketing and sale of our many products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations additionally the government of mexico enacted broad based tax reform including a one peso per liter tax on the manufacturing of certain sugarsweetened beverages which went into effect january 1 2014 as a result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity 

we and our bottlers use various refillable and nonrefillable recyclable bottles and cans in the us and other countries various states and other authorities require deposits ecotaxes or fees on certain containers similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local state and federal levels both in the us and elsewhere in mexico the government has encouraged the soft drink industry to comply voluntarily with collection and recycling programs of plastic material and we are in compliance with these programs 

environmental health and safety matters 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations we maintain environmental health and safety policies and a quality environmental health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations the cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations 

available information 

our web site address is wwwdrpeppersnapplegroupcom information on our web site is not incorporated by reference in this document we make available free of charge through this web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 

market and industry data 

the market and industry data in this annual report on form 10k is from independent industry sources including nielsen and beverage digest although we believe that these independent sources are reliable we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of this data or any assumptions underlying such data 

nielsen is a marketing information provider primarily serving consumer packaged goods manufacturers and retailers we use nielsen data as our primary management tool to track market performance because it has broad and deep data coverage is based on consumer transactions at retailers and is reported to us monthly nielsen data provides measurement and analysis of marketplace trends such as market share retail pricing promotional activity and distribution across various channels retailers and geographies measured categories provided to us by nielsen scantrack include csds energy drinks singleserve bottled water nonalcoholic mixers and ncbs including readytodrink teas singleserve and multiserve juice and juice drinks and sports drinks nielsen also provides data on other food items such as apple sauce nielsen data we present in this report is from nielsens scantrack service which compiles data based on scanner transactions in key retail channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers including walmart drug chains convenience stores and gas stations however this data does not include the fountain or vending channels or small independent retail outlets which together represent a meaningful portion of the us lrb market and of our net sales and volume 

beverage digest is an independent beverage research company that publishes an annual beverage digest fact book we use beverage digest primarily to track market share information and broad beverage and channel trends this annual publication provides a compilation of data supplied by beverage companies beverage digest covers the following categories csds energy drinks bottled water and ncbs including readytodrink teas juice and juice drinks and sports drinks beverage digest data does not include multiserve juice products or bottled water in packages of 15 liters or more data is reported for certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores drug chains convenience stores gas stations fountains vending machines and the upanddownthestreet channel consisting of small independent retail outlets 

  

we use both nielsen and beverage digest to assess both our own and our competitors performance and market share in the us different market share rankings can result for a specific beverage category depending on whether data from nielsen or beverage digest is used in part because of the differences in the sales channels reported by each source for example because the fountain channel where we have a relatively small business except for dr pepper is not included in nielsen data our market share using nielsen data is generally higher for our csd portfolio than the beverage digest data which does include the fountain channel 

in this annual report on form 10k all information regarding the beverage market in the us is from beverage digest and except as otherwise indicated is from 2013  all information regarding our brand market positions in the us is from nielsen and is based on retail dollar sales in 2014  




 item 1a  risk factors 

risks related to our business 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties could harm our business and financial condition   

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors 

consumers preferences can change due to a variety of factors including the age and ethnic demographics of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds and the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds as such the demand for csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences then quickly develop new products in response our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

new or proposed beverage taxes or regulations could impact our sales 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 the government of mexico enacted broad based tax reform including a one peso per liter tax on the manufacturing of certain sugarsweetened beverages which went into effect january 1 2014 as a result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity during the fourth quarter of 2014 the city of berkeley california enacted a one cent per ounce tax on the distribution of certain sugarsweetened beverages which went into effect january 1 2015 federal state and other local and foreign governments could also impose taxes on sugarsweetened beverages as a result of these concerns additionally local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types or sizes of soft drinks in municipalities and schools as a result of these concerns any changes of regulations or imposed taxes may reduce consumer demand for our products or could cause us to raise our prices both of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience brand recognition can also be impacted by   the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which represent approximately   60  o f the us lrb market by volume according to beverage digest we also compete against other large companies including nestle kraft foods and campbell soup these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products changing their route to market reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers we have lower exposure to energy drinks some of the faster growing ncbs and the bottled water segments in the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

  

if we are unable to compete effectively our sales could decline as a result we would potentially reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segments operations generate a significant portion of our overall segment operating profit sop some of these bottlers such as pepsico and cocacola are also our competitors the majority of these bottlers business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance   

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2014  we had 8273 million  of total assets of which approximately 5674 million  were goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinitelived intangible assets in connection with brands distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess there was no impairment required based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of october 1 2014  for additional information about these intangible assets see critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances some of which are beyond our control factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events and v changes in our discount rates since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

increases in our cost of benefits and multiemployer plan withdrawal liabilities in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

additionally we  currently participate in three multiemployer pension plans in the united states the plans we participate in have collective bargaining agreements which will expire at various dates through 2016 in the event that it becomes probable that we intend to withdraw from participation in any of these plans us gaap would require us to record a withdrawal liability if it is estimable which may be material and could negatively impact our financial performance in the applicable periods our pension expense for us multiemployer plans totaled 6 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  

costs for commodities such as raw materials and energy may change substantially 

the principal raw materials we use in our products are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas 

price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers price increases we pass along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance furthermore price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for marktomarket changes in the derivative instruments 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in mexico and canada may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales expenses profits assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso or the canadian dollar we manage a small portion of our exposure to the canadian dollar utilizing derivative instruments and are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations as a result our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates moreover any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit gross margin income from operations or segment operating profit from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us canada mexico or the caribbean may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials additionally these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of   unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedging arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

  

our total indebtedness excluding capital lease obligations could affect our operations and profitability 

we maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our actual and expected cash flows as of december 31 2014  our total indebtedness was 2591 million  

this amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including 

 while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control 

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various benefitrelated accounting and transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information disrupting business processes or corrupting information these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets litigation remediation costs damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event which could adversely affect our business 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings which may include employment tort real estate commercial and other litigation from time to time we are a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts which are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners fruit juice and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability cybersecurity attacks and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

  

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation or supply interruption government regulation cybersecurity attacks or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may fail to comply with applicable government laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see regulatory matters in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations 

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture safety labeling transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing   certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products  such as californias prop 65 which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects are or could become applicable to our products 

weather climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns global warming concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

we also may be faced with water availability risks water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls liability claims and negative publicity moreover negative publicity also could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

  

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly andor annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law in addition tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

as of   december 31 2014  approximately   6000  of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see intellectual property and trademarks in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of these trademarks or negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license products from third parties that we distribute the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we expect to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

approximately   83   of our   2014   packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our owned and licensed brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as big red   fiji mineral water arizona tea vita coco coconut water bai 5 neuro drinks sparkling fruit 2 o and hydrive energy drinks  we are subject to a risk of our allied brands terminating their distribution agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have key person life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees 

  

changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results 

we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations the financial accounting standards board is currently in the process of deliberating changes to a number of existing standards governing a variety of areas certain of these proposed standards particularly the proposed standard governing the accounting for leases if and when effective could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements additionally compliance with such requirements may result in increased selling general and administrative expenses or capital expenditures and the associated depreciation expense refer to   note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements   in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and recently adopted provisions of us gaap

the periods presented in this section are the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  which we refer to as  2014   2013  and  2012  respectively 

overview 

we are a leading integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the us canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored csds and ncbs including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks water and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper sunkist soda 7up aw canada dry crush squirt peñafiel and schweppes and ncb brands such as snapple motts hawaiian punch clamato roses and mr  mrs t mixers our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the us according to nielsen we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers   

we operate as an integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor through our three segments we believe our integrated business model strengthens our routetomarket and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our dsd system and our wd delivery system our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage 

we operate primarily in the us mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2014  88  of our net sales were generated in the us 4  in canada and 8  in mexico and the caribbean 

uncertainties and trends affecting our business 

we believe the north american lrb market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties some of these items such as increased health consciousness and changes in economic factors have created continued category headwinds for our csds during the year ended december 31 2014 and have unfavorably impacted our sales volumes excluding the impact of recent product innovations and acquisitions compared to the prior year the key trends and uncertainties that could affect our business include 

 24 

  

 as a result of these uncertainties and other factors we believe net sales for the year ending december 31 2015 could be up approxima tely 1 as co mpared to the year ended december 31 2014 commodity costs for the year ending december 31 2015 could be down approximate ly 1 on a constant volumemix basis as c ompared to the year ended december 31 2014 

refer to item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company 

seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

segments 

we report our business in three operating segments 

 segment results are based on management reports net sales and sop are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of our operating segments 

volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 concentrate case sales and 2 bottler case sales the unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings 

  

concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases 

although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels 

packaged beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages segment we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

volume in bottler case sales 

in addition to sales volume we measure volume in bottler case sales volume bcs as sales of packaged beverages in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume bcs 

bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

consolidated operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated  results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013  dollars in millions   except per share data  



volume bcs   volume bcs increased 1  for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared with the year ended   december 31   2013  in the us and canada volume was flat and in mexico and the caribbean volume in creased 5  compared with the year ago period branded csd volume increased 1  while branded ncb volume declined 1  

in branded csds peñafiel grew 21  in our latin america beverages segment as a result of product and package innovation our core 4 brands increased 2  compared to the year ago period driven by an 8  increase in canada dry partially offset by a 1  decline in 7up aw and sunkist soda were both flat for the period schweppes grew 10  reflecting distribution gains in our seltzer water and growth in the ginger ale category these gains were partially offset by a 2  decrease in dr pepper driven primarily by declines in our diet products and a 5  decrease in our other csd brands in total crush squirt and rc cola declined 1  1  and 2  respectively 

in branded ncbs decreases were driven by a 7  decrease in hawaiian punch as a result of category declines and increased competitive activity a 1  decline in our other ncb brands in total and a 1  decrease in motts as a result of declines in apple sauce the decline was partially offset by a 7  increase in clamato driven by increased promotional activity and 3  growth in our water category primarily driven by new distribution arrangements for bai 5 and sparkling fruit 2 o and distribution gains in fiji and vita coco snapple increased 1  for the current period as growth in our higher margin snapple premium products was partially offset by our deemphasis on our value products 

  

net sales   net sales in creased 124 million  or approximately 2  for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared with the year ended   december 31   2013  the primary drivers of the in crease were favorable product and package mix increased branded sales volume higher pricing driven by the mexican sugar tax and an increase in contract manufacturing these drivers were partially offset by 35 million  in unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher discounts driven primarily by the annual trueup of our prior year estimated customer liability 

gross profit  gross profit in creased 132 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared with the year ended   december 31   2013  gross margin was 593  and 583  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the drivers of the favorable change in gross margin were lower commodity costs net of the change in our lastin firstout lifo inventory provision ongoing productivity improvements and marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts which increased gross margin 11  08  and 04  respectively these drivers were partially offset by unfavorable product package and segment mix the net impact of the mexican sugar tax unfavorable foreign currency effects and an increase in other manufacturing costs which decreased gross margin by 05  04  02  and 02  respectively 

the favorable marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts for the year ended   december 31 2014  was 11 million  in unrealized gains versus 15 million  in unrealized losses in the prior year the unfavorable comparison in our lifo inventory provision was the result of a 3 million  increase in the provision for the year ended   december 31 2014  versus a 39 million  decrease in the provision for the year ended   december 31   2013  driven primarily by apple prices 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative sga expenses increased 62 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared with the prior year the increase was primarily driven by the following items 

 for the year ended   december 31 2014  we recognized 24 million  in unrealized losses related to the marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts versus 1 million  in unrealized losses in the year ago period 

these items were partially offset by a planned reduction of 13 million  for our marketing investments the favorable impact of foreign currency and the favorable comparison of the 7 million  in workforce reduction costs related to certain restructuring activities in the prior year 

multiemployer pension plan withdrawal we recognized a noncash charge of 56 million related to our withdrawal from local 710 during the year ended   december 31   2013  refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for further information on this charge 

income from operations income from operations in creased 134 million  to 1180 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  due primarily to the increase in gross profit and the favorable comparison to the noncash charge for the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal taken in the prior year partially offset by an increase in our sga expenses 

interest expense interest expense de creased 14 million  or approximately 11  for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared with the year ago period primarily due to the favorable impact of our fair value hedges and the repayment of our 612 senior unsecured notes in may 2013 the 2013 notes 

other expense income net and benefit provision for income taxes   through the second quarter of 2013 we recorded indemnification income from mondelēz under the tax indemnity agreement as other expense net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income due to the completion of the irs audit for our 20062008 federal income tax returns in august 2013 we recognized an income tax benefit of 463 million  primarily related to decreasing our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and 430 million  of other expense net as we no longer anticipate collecting amounts from mondelēz in june 2013 a bill was enacted by the canadian government which reduced amounts amortized for income tax purposes we recognized 38 million  of indemnity income due to the reduction of our longterm liability to mondelēz and 50 million  of income tax expense for the reduction of our tax assets 

  

the following table excludes these amounts discussed above from our other expense income net income before provision benefit for income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and provision benefit for income taxes lines within our consolidated  statements of income we have presented this table as we believe the effect of those items on these lines and on our effective tax rate for the year ended  december 31 2013 are not meaningful as reported

liquidity 

based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary 

the following table summarizes our cash activity for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  in millions 



net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in creased 156 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended   december 31 2013  primarily due to the increase in net income and the favorable working capital comparisons to the prior year 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 384 million for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 primarily due to the favorable comparison of the 2012 tax payments of 531 million resulting from the licensing agreements with pepsico and cocacola partially offset by unfavorable working capital comparisons to the prior year 

net cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended   december 31 2014  consisted primarily of purchases of property plant and equipment of 170 million  and 19 million  paid in connection with the acquisition of davis purchases of property plant and equipment have decreased over the prior period in line with our focus on reducing our purchases net of proceeds from disposal of property plant and equipment in an amount below 300 of our current year net sales

debt ratings 

as of   december 31 2014  our debt ratings were baa1 with a stable outlook from moodys and bbb with a stable outlook from   sp  our commercial paper ratings were p2a2 from moodys and sp respectively 

these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations 

cash management 

we fund our liquidity needs from cash flow from operations cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements as commercial paper is now a more significant part of our overall cash management strategy 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 170 million  179 million  and 217 million  for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  respectively capital expenditures have reduced over the last three years as a result of a stronger focus on the return on our discretionary capital expenditures the result of our rci initiatives and reduced infrastructure investments required after our separation from cadbury capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily related to machinery and equipment including production improvements in our mexico facilities our distribution fleet it investments and expansion and replacement of existing cold drink equipment for the year ended december 31 2013 capital expenditures primarily related to machinery and equipment it investments expansion and replacement of existing cold drink equipment and our distribution fleet capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily related to machinery and equipment expansion and replacement of existing cold drink equipment our distribution fleet and it investments 

in 2015  we expect to incur annual capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposals in an amount approximately 300 of our net sales which we expect to fund through cash provided by operating activities 

  

cash and cash equivalents 

as a result of the above items cash and cash equivalents in creased 84 million  since december 31 2013  to 237 million  as of december 31 2014  primarily driven by higher operating cash flows lower capital expenditures and lower scheduled debt payments partially offset by increased returns to our shareholders 

our cash balances are used to fund working capital requirements scheduled debt and interest payments income tax obligations repurchases of our common stock dividend payments and capital expenditures cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the us annually except when required to fund working capital requirements in those jurisdictions foreign cash balances were 51 million  and 65 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively we accrue tax costs for repatriation as applicable as cash is generated in those foreign jurisdictions

contractual commitments and obligations 

we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding the senior unsecured notes payments described in this table 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies as of december 31 2014  in millions 



 

 amounts excluded from our table 

as of december 31 2014  we had 12 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits related interest and penalties classified as a longterm liability the table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment refer to note 12 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  

the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31 2014  was approximately 44 million  this amount is impacted by among other items funding levels plan amendments changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above 

the pension protection act of 2006 was enacted in august 2006 and established among other things new standards for funding of us defined benefit pension plans we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations we did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above 

  

additionally we recorded an estimated 57 million  withdrawal liability during 2013 for certain multiemployer pension plans we have withdrawn from as we can not estimate the timing or actual amount of payments until the plan formally assesses us with the withdrawal liability those payments have been excluded from the table above 

refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for further information regarding our single employer and multiemployer plans discussed above 

we have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities we did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control refer to note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  

in general we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are selfinsured for large portions of many different types of claims our insurance liability for our losses related to these programs are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history as of december 31 2014  our insurance liability totaled approximately 136 million  refer to notes 8 and 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements we did not include estimated payments related to our insurance liability in the table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we currently participate in three multiemployer pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan and us gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multiemployer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable there are no other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding 

refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit 

other matters 

agreements with pepsico and cocacola 

on february 26 2010 we completed the licensing of certain brands to pepsico following pepsicos acquisitions of pepsi bottling group and pepsiamericas inc under the agreements we received a onetime nonrefundable cash payment of 900 million the agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20year renewal periods  and require pepsico to meet certain performance conditions   

on october 4 2010 we completed the licensing of certain brands to cocacola following cocacolas acquisition of cocacola enterprises north american bottling business and executed separate agreements pursuant to which cocacola began offering dr pepper and diet dr pepper in local fountain accounts and its freestyle fountain program under the agreements we received a onetime nonrefundable cash payment of 715 million the agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20year renewal periods  and require cocacola to meet certain performance conditions   

under a separate agreement cocacola has agreed to include dr pepper and diet dr pepper brands in its freestyle fountain program the freestyle fountain program agreement has a period of 20 years 

these payments were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25year life of the customer relationships 

  

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of these and other accounting policies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices from time to time we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge or mitigate commercial risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation investing or trading 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars however we have some exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred as of december 31 2014  the impact to our income from operations of a 10 change up or down in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 23 million  on an annual basis 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2014  we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 10 million  maturing at various dates through december 15 2015 

interest rate risk 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio through the use of interest rate swaps and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variable rate debt at december 31 2014  the carrying value of our fixedrate debt excluding capital leases was 2505 million  720 million  of which is designated as fair value hedges and exposed to variability in interest rates 

  

the following table is an estimate of the impact to the fair value hedges that could result from hypothetical interest rate changes during the term of the financial instruments based on debt levels as of december 31 2014  



 

 2 the change in fair value would impact the carrying value of our unsecured senior notes with an equal offset to our derivative instrument positions see notes 8 and 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for quantification of those positions 

commodity risks 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of pet diesel fuel corn for high fructose corn syrup aluminum sucrose apple juice concentrate apples and natural gas for use in processing and packaging 

we utilize commodities forward and future contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2014  was a net liability  of 26 million  

as of december 31 2014  the impact of a 10 change up or down in market prices for these commodities where the risk of adverse movements has not been hedged is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 21 million  to our income from operations for the year ending december 31 2015

integrated business model   our integrated business model provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses for example we can focus on maximizing profitability for our company as a whole rather than focusing on profitability generated from either the sale of beverage concentrates or the bottling and distribution of our products additionally our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage our manufacturing and distribution system also enables us to improve focus on our brands especially certain brands such as 7up sunkist soda aw squirt vernors canada dry hawaiian punch and snapple which do not have a large presence in the bottler systems affiliated with the cocacola company cocacola or pepsico inc pepsico 

strong customer relationships   our brands have enjoyed longstanding relationships with many of our top customers we sell our products to a wide range of customers from bottlers and distributors to national retailers large food service and convenience store customers we have strong relationships with some of the largest bottlers and distributors including those affiliated with cocacola and pepsico some of the largest and most important retailers including walmart stores inc walmart the kroger co supervalu inc safeway inc publix super markets inc and target corporation some of the largest food service customers including mcdonalds corporation burger king corp yum brands inc sonic corp the wendys company subway restaurants jack in the box inc chickfila inc and arbys group inc and convenience store customers including 7eleven inc circle k enterprises inc and oxxo our portfolio of strong brands operational scale and experience across beverage segments has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with our customers 

attractive positioning within a large and profitable market   we hold the 1   position in the us flavored csd beverage markets by volume according to beverage digest we are also a leader in the canada and mexico beverage markets our portfolio of products is biased toward flavored csds which continue to gain market share versus cola csds but also focuses on emerging categories such as teas and juices   we believe marketing and product innovations that target fast growing population segments such as the hispanic community in the us could drive market growth 

broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage   as of   december 31 2013  we had   18  manufacturing facilities and 113  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in the us as well as two  manufacturing facilities and eight  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in mexico these facilities use a variety of manufacturi ng processes we have strategically located manufacturing and distribution capabilities enabling us to better align our operations with our customers reduce transportation costs and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches in addition our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and geographically dispersed to ensure our products are available to meet consumer demand we actively manage transportation of our products using our own fleet of approximately   6000   delivery trucks as well as third party logistics providers on a selected basis 

strong operating margins and stable cash flows   the breadth of our brand portfolio has enabled us to generate strong operating margins which have delivered stable cash flows these cash flows enable us to consider a variety of alternatives such as investing in our business repurchasing shares of our common stock paying dividends to our stockholders and reducing our debt   as a result of our stable cash flows and the reduction of our capital expenditures we have been able to increase our dividends each year in order to return more cash to our stockholders 

experienced executive management team   our executive management team has over   200 years of collective experience in the food and beverage industry the team has broad experience in brand ownership manufacturing and distribution and enjoys strong relationships both within the industry and with major customers in addition our management team has diverse skills that support our operating strategies including driving organic growth through targeted and efficient marketing improving productivity of our operations aligning manufacturing and distribution interests and executing strategic acquisitions 

our strategy 

  the key elements of our business strategy are to

customers 

we primarily serve two groups of customers 1 bottlers and distributors and 2 retailers 

bottlers buy beverage concentrates from us and in turn they manufacture bottle sell and distribute finished beverages bottlers also manufacture an d distribute syrup for the fountain foodservice channel in addition bottlers and distributors purchase finished beverages from us and sell them to retail and other customers we have strong relationships with bottlers affiliated with cocacola and pepsico primarily because of the strength and market position of our key dr pepper brand 

retailers also buy finished beverages directly from us our portfolio of strong brands operational scale and experience in the beverage industry have enabled us to maintain strong relationships with major retailers in the us canada and mexico in 2013  our largest retailer was walmart representing approximately 12  of our consolidated net sales 

seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

competition 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which collectively represent approximately   60  of the us lrb market by volume according to beverage digest we also compete against other large companies including nestlé sa nestle kraft foods group inc and the campbell soup company campbell soup these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as the cott corporation cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we have lower exposure to some of the faster growing noncarbonated and bottled water segments in the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

although these bottlers and distributors are our competitors many of these companies are also our customers as they purchase beverage concentrates from us 

intellectual property and trademarks 

our intellectual property   we possess a variety of intellectual property rights that are important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets to safeguard our proprietary rights including our brands and ingredient and production formulas for our products 

  

our trademarks   our trademark portfolio includes approximately 2300  registrations and applications in the us canada mexico and other countries brands we own through various subsidiaries in various jurisdictions include dr pepper 7up aw canada dry rc cola schweppes squirt crush peñafiel sun drop aguafiel snapple motts hawaiian punch clamato mistic nantucket nectars mr  mrs t realemon venom and deja blue we own trademark registrations for most of these brands in the us and we own trademark registrations for some but not all of these brands in canada mexico and other countries we also own trademark registrations for a number of smaller regional brands some of our other trademark registrations are in countries where we do not currently have any significant level of business in addition in many countries outside the us canada and mexico our rights to many of our csd brands including our dr pepper trademark and formula were sold by cadbury schweppes beginning over a decade ago to third parties including in certain cases to competitors such as cocacola 

trademarks licensed from others we license various trademarks from third parties which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute certain products or brands throughout the us andor canada and mexico for example we license from third parties the sunkist soda welchs country time orangina stewarts roses holland house and margaritaville trademarks although these licenses vary in length and other terms they generally are longterm cover the entire us andor canada and mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor 

licensed distribution rights we have rights in certain territories to bottle andor distribute various brands we do not own such as arizona fiji vita coco and neuro some of these arrangements are relatively shorter in term and limited in geographic scope and the licensor may be able to terminate the agreement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us 

intellectual property we license to others we license some of our intellectual property including trademarks to others for example we license the dr pepper trademark to certain companies for use in connection with food confectionery and other products we also license certain brands such as dr pepper and snapple to third parties for use in beverages in certain countries where we own the brand but do not otherwise operate our business 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to grow our brands through continuously providing new solutions to meet consumers changing preferences and needs we identify these preferences and needs and then develop innovative consumer and shopper programs to address the opportunities solutions include new and reformulated products improved packaging design pricing and enhanced availability we use   advertising sponsorships merchandising public relations promotions and social media   to provide maximum impact for our brands and messages 

manufacturing 

as of december 31 2013  we operated 20  manufacturing facilities across the us and mexico almost all of our csd beverage concentrates are manufactured at a single plant in st louis missouri all of our manufacturing facilities are either regional manufacturing facilities with the capacity and capabilities to manufacture many brands and packages facilities with particular capabilities that are dedicated to certain brands or products or smaller bottling plants with a more limited range of packaging capabilities 

we employed approximately   5000   fulltime manufacturing employees in our facilities as of   december 31 2013  we have a variety of production capabilities including hotfill coldfill and aseptic bottling processes and we manufacture beverages in a variety of packaging materials including aluminum glass and pet cans and bottles and a variety of package formats including singleserve and multiserve packages and baginbox fountain syrup packaging 

in 2013  90  of our manufactured volumes came from our brands and 10  from third party and privatelabel products we also use third party manufacturers to package our products for us on a limited basis 

  

warehousing and distribution 

as of   december 31 2013  our distribution network consisted of   113  principal distribution centers and warehouses in the us and eight  principal distribution centers and warehouses in mexico our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and are geographically dispersed to ensure product is available to meet consumer demand we actively manage the sale merchandising and transportation of our products using a combination of our own fleet of approximately   6000   delivery vehicles and third party logistics providers 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially in addition we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses 

under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging manufacturing costs for our packaged beverages segment where we manufacture and bottle finished beverages are higher as a percentage of our net sales than our beverage concentrates segment as the packaged beverages segment requires the purchase of a much larger portion of the packaging and ingredients although we have contracts with a relatively small number of suppliers we have generally not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required amount of raw materials 

when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process through the use of forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of shortterm predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position 

research and development 

our research and development team is composed of scientists and engineers in the us and mexico who are focused on developing high quality products which have broad consumer appeal can be sold at competitive prices and can be safely and consistently produced across a diverse manufacturing network our research and development team engages in activities relating to product development microbiology analytical chemistry process engineering sensory science nutrition knowledge management and regulatory compliance we have particular expertise in flavors and sweeteners which allows us to focus our research in areas of importance to the industry such as new sweetener development research and development costs are expensed when incurred and amounted to   15 million   for each of   2013    2012   and   2011  additionally we incurred packaging engineering costs of   6 million  for each of 2013  2012  and 2011  these expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 

information technology 

we use a variety of it systems and networks configured to meet our business needs our primary it data center is hosted in toronto canada by a third party provider we also use a third party vendor for application support and maintenance which is based in india and provides resources offshore and onshore 

employees 

at   december 31 2013  we employed approximately   19000 e mployees 

in the us we have approximately   16000   fulltime employees we have union collective bargaining agreements covering approximately   4000   fulltime employees several agreements cover multiple locations these agreements address working conditions as well as wage rates and benefits in mexico and the caribbean we employ approximately   3000 fu lltime employees with approximately   2000   employees party to collective bargaining agreements we do not have a significant number of employees in canada 

we believe we have good relations with our employees 

  

regulatory matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business regulations apply to many aspects of our business including our products and their ingredients manufacturing safety labeling transportation recycling advertising and sale for example our products and their manufacturing labeling marketing and sale in the us are subject to various aspects of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal trade commission act the lanham act state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws in canada and mexico the manufacture distribution marketing and sale of our many products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations additionally the government of mexico enacted broad based tax reform including a one peso per liter tax on the manufacturing of certain sugarsweetened beverages which went into effect january 1 2014 as a result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity 

we and our bottlers use various refillable and nonrefillable recyclable bottles and cans in the us and other countries various states and other authorities require deposits ecotaxes or fees on certain containers similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local state and federal levels both in the us and elsewhere in mexico the government has encouraged the soft drink industry to comply voluntarily with collection and recycling programs of plastic material and we are in compliance with these programs 

environmental health and safety matters 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations we maintain environmental health and safety policies and a quality environmental health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations the cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations 

available information 

our web site address is wwwdrpeppersnapplegroupcom information on our web site is not incorporated by reference in this document we make available free of charge through this web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 

market and industry data 

the market and industry data in this annual report on form 10k is from independent industry sources including nielsen and beverage digest although we believe that these independent sources are reliable we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of this data or any assumptions underlying such data 

nielsen is a marketing information provider primarily serving consumer packaged goods manufacturers and retailers we use nielsen data as our primary management tool to track market performance because it has broad and deep data coverage is based on consumer transactions at retailers and is reported to us monthly nielsen data provides measurement and analysis of marketplace trends such as market share retail pricing promotional activity and distribution across various channels retailers and geographies measured categories provided to us by nielsen scantrack include csds energy drinks singleserve bottled water nonalcoholic mixers and ncbs including readytodrink teas singleserve and multiserve juice and juice drinks and sports drinks nielsen also provides data on other food items such as apple sauce nielsen data we present in this report is from nielsens scantrack service which compiles data based on scanner transactions in key retail channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers including walmart drug chains convenience stores and gas stations however this data does not include the fountain or vending channels or small independent retail outlets which together represent a meaningful portion of the us lrb market and of our net sales and volume 

beverage digest is an independent beverage research company that publishes an annual beverage digest fact book we use beverage digest primarily to track market share information and broad beverage and channel trends this annual publication provides a compilation of data supplied by beverage companies beverage digest covers the following categories csds energy drinks bottled water and ncbs including readytodrink teas juice and juice drinks and sports drinks beverage digest data does not include multiserve juice products or bottled water in packages of 15 liters or more data is reported for certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores drug chains convenience stores gas stations fountains vending machines and the upanddownthestreet channel consisting of small independent retail outlets 

  

we use both nielsen and beverage digest to assess both our own and our competitors performance and market share in the us different market share rankings can result for a specific beverage category depending on whether data from nielsen or beverage digest is used in part because of the differences in the sales channels reported by each source for example because the fountain channel where we have a relatively small business except for dr pepper is not included in nielsen data our market share using nielsen data is generally higher for our csd portfolio than the beverage digest data which does include the fountain channel 

in this annual report on form 10k all information regarding the beverage market in the us is from beverage digest and except as otherwise indicated is from 2012  all information regarding our brand market positions in the us is from nielsen and is based on retail dollar sales in 2013  




 item 1a  risk factors 

risks related to our business 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties could harm our business and financial condition   

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors 

consumers preferences can change due to a variety of factors including the age and ethnic demographics of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds and the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds as such the demand for csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences then quickly develop new products in response our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

new or proposed beverage taxes or regulations could impact our sales 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 the government of mexico enacted broad based tax reform including a one peso per liter tax on the manufacturing of certain sugarsweetened beverages which went into effect january 1 2014 as a result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity federal state local and other foreign governments could also impose taxes on sugarsweetened beverages as a result of these concerns additionally local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types or sizes of soft drinks in municipalities and schools as a result of these concerns any changes of regulations or imposed taxes may reduce consumer demand for our products or could cause us to raise our prices both of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience brand recognition can also be impacted by   the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which represent approximately   60  o f the us lrb market by volume according to beverage digest we also compete against other large companies including nestle kraft foods group inc and campbell soup these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products changing their route to market reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we have lower exposure to energy drinks some of the faster growing ncbs and the bottled water segments in the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

if we are unable to compete effectively our sales could decline as a result we would have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

  

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segments operations generate a significant portion of our overall segment operating profit some of these bottlers such as pepsico and cocacola are also our competitors the majority of these bottlers business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance   

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us canada mexico or the caribbean may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials additionally these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of   unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedging arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

costs for raw materials and energy costs may increase substantially 

the principal raw materials we use in our products are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business we are significantly impacted by increases in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas 

continued price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers price increases we pass along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

  

increases in our cost of benefits and multiemployer plan withdrawal liabilities in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

additionally we  currently participate in four multiemployer pension plans in the united states the plans we participate in have collective bargaining agreements which will expire at various dates through 2016 in the event that it becomes probable that we intend to withdraw from participation in any of these plans us gaap would require us to record a withdrawal liability if it is estimable which may be material and could negatively impact our financial performance in the applicable periods our pension expense for us multiemployer plans totaled 63 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  which included a withdrawal charge of 56 million  as we intend to withdraw from the soft drink industry local union 710 pension fund during our upcoming collective bargaining session 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets has occurred and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2013  we had 8201 million  of total assets of which approximately 5682 million  were goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinitelived intangible assets in connection with brands bottler agreements distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets annually as of october 1 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess there was no impairment required based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of october 1 2013  for additional information about these intangible assets see critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances some of which are beyond our control factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our results of operations 

our total indebtedness could affect our operations and profitability 

we maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our actual and expected cash flows as of december 31 2013  our total indebtedness was 2574 million   

this amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including 

 while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control 

  

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings which may include employment tort real estate commercial and other litigation from time to time we are a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts which are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners fruit juice and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation or supply interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may fail to comply with applicable government laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see regulatory matters in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations 

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture safety labeling transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing certain state warning and labeling laws such as californias prop 65 which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects are or could become applicable to our products 

weather climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns global warming concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

  

we also may be faced with water availability risks water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls liability claims and negative publicity moreover negative publicity also could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly andor annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law in addition tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

as of   december 31 2013  approximately   6000  of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see intellectual property and trademarks in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of these trademarks or negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license products from third parties that we distribute the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we expect to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

  

our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

approximately   84   of our   2013   packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our owned and licensed brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as   fiji big red arizona hydrive vita coco and neuro  we are subject to a risk of our allied brands terminating their distribution agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various benefitrelated accounting and transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses hackers other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have key person life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees 

changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results 

we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations the financial accounting standards board is currently in the process of deliberating changes to a number of existing standards governing a variety of areas certain of these proposed standards particularly the proposed standard governing the accounting for leases if and when effective could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements additionally compliance with such requirements may result in increased selling general and administrative expenses or capital expenditures and the associated depreciation expense refer to   note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements   in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and recently adopted provisions of us gaap

the periods presented in this section are the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  which we refer to as  2013   2012  and  2011  respectively 

overview 

we are a leading integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the united states us canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored carbonated soft drinks csds and noncarbonated beverages ncbs including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper sunkist soda 7up aw canada dry crush squirt peñafiel and schweppes and ncb brands such as snapple motts hawaiian punch clamato roses and mr  mrs t mixers our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the us according to the nielsen company we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers   

we operate as an integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor through our three segments we believe our integrated business model strengthens our routetomarket and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our direct store delivery dsd system and our warehouse direct wd delivery system our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage 

we operate primarily in the us mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2013  88  of our net sales were generated in the us 4  in canada and 8  in mexico and the caribbean 

uncertainties and trends affecting our business 

we believe the north american liquid refreshment beverage lrb market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties some of these items such as increased health consciousness and changes in economic factors have created continued category headwinds for our csds during the year ended december 31 2013 and have unfavorably impacted our sales volumes compared to the prior year the key trends and uncertainties that could affect our business include 

 23 

  

 as a result of these uncertainties and other factors we believe net sales for the year ending december 31 2014 could be up only 1 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 

refer to item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company 

seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

segments 

we report our business in three operating segments 

 segment results are based on management reports net sales and segment operating profit sop are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of our operating segments 

volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 concentrate case sales and 2 bottler case sales the unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings 

  

concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases 

although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels 

packaged beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages segment we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

volume in bottler case sales 

in addition to sales volume we measure volume in bottler case sales volume bcs as sales of packaged beverages in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume bcs 

bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

consolidated operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated  results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  dollars in millions   except per share data  



volume bcs   volume bcs decreased 2  for the year ended   december 31 2013  compared with the year ended   december 31   2012  in the us and canada volume declined 2  and in mexico and the caribbean volume increased 3  compared with the year ago period both csd volume and ncb volume declined 2  

in csds volumes were unfavorably impacted by continued category headwinds which included increased consumer concerns about health and wellness dr pepper volume declined 2  our core 4 brands which included the impact of the launch of our core 4 ten products decreased 1 compared to the year ago period this result was driven by a a 5  decrease in 7up a 7  decline in sunkist soda and a 2  decrease in aw partially offset by a 6  increase in canada dry crush squirt and rc cola declined 7  4  and 4  respectively sun drop declined doubledigits other brands in total declined 3 these decreases were partially offset by growth of 11  in peñafiel as a result of product and package innovation and a 6  increase in schweppes reflecting distribution gains in our seltzer water and growth in the ginger ale category 

in ncbs decreases were driven by a 9  decrease in hawaiian punch as a result of lower promotional activity and declines within the category and an 8 decline in other brands the decline was partially offset by a 2 increase in snapple as a result of package and product innovation and a 3  increase in motts due to distribution gains in our juice and sauce categories our water category increased 3 led by aguafiel clamato increased 6 

net sales   net sales in creased 2 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  compared with the year ended   december 31   2012  the in crease was attributable to favorable mix net pricing increases and favorable foreign currency translation substantially offset by lower branded sales volumes and an unfavorable comparison of trade adjustments 

  

gross profit  gross profit increased 3 million for the year ended   december 31 2013  compared with the year ended   december 31   2012  gross margin was 583  for both years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  significant activity within the gross margin included the 58 million favorable comparison in our lifo inventory provision driven by the higher prices of apples in the prior year and increases in our net price realization these favorable changes were offset by increases in our commodity costs led by apples and sweeteners the 30 million unfavorable comparison for the marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts and unfavorable mix due to a higher mix of finished goods rather than concentrates as well as package and product mix the change in our lifo inventory provision for the year ended   december 31 2013  was a 39 million reduction in the provision versus a 19 million increase in the provision for the year ended   december 31   2012  the marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts for the year ended   december 31 2013  was 15 million in unrealized losses versus 15 million in unrealized gains in the year ago period 

selling general and administrative expenses sga expenses increased 4 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  compared with the prior period the increase was primarily the result of 7 million in workforce reduction costs incremental operating costs associated with the acquisition of certain assets of dr pepper7up bottling company of the west dp7up west  increased marketing investments and the unfavorable comparison for the marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts these increases were partially offset by lower labor and benefit costs a 6 million favorable adjustment in 2013 to the legal provision associated with litigation against the american bottling group as a result of settlement agreements with certain plaintiffs abc litigation and lower logistics costs 

multiemployer pension plan withdrawal we recognized a noncash charge of 56 million related to our intention to withdraw from local 710 refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for further information on this charge 

income from operations income from operations de creased 46 million  to 1046 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  principally due to the noncash charge for the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal and an increase in sga expenses partially offset by the decline in depreciation and amortization driven by the favorable comparison to the 8 million depreciation adjustment recorded in the prior year 

other expense net and benefit provision for income taxes   we have historically recorded indemnification income from mondelēz under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement tax indemnity agreement as other expense income net in the consolidated  statements of income due to the completion of the irs audit for our 20062008 federal income tax returns in august 2013 we recognized an income tax benefit of 463 million  primarily related to decreasing our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and 430 million of other expense net as we no longer anticipate collecting amounts from mondelēz additionally in june 2013 a bill was enacted by the canadian government which reduced amounts amortized for income tax purposes as a result we recognized 38 million of indemnity income due to the reduction of our longterm liability to mondelēz and 50 million of income tax expense for the reduction of our tax assets 

the following table excludes these amounts discussed above from our other expense income net loss income before benefit provision for income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and benefit provision for income taxes lines within our consolidated  statements of income we have presented this table as we believe the effect of those items on these lines and on our effective tax rate for the year ended   december 31 2013  are not meaningful as reported

net sales   net sales increased 92 million or approximately 2 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 the increase was attributable to price increases and favorable mix these drivers were partially offset by lower sales volumes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency 

  

gross profit  gross profit increased 77 million or approximately 2 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 gross margin of 583 for the year ended december 31 2012 was higher than the 579 gross margin for the year ended december 31 2011 significant factors causing the increase in gross margin were increases in our net price realization and 15 million of unrealized gains during the year ended december 31 2012 for the marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts which were partially offset by higher costs for apples flavors apple juice concentrate packaging sweeteners and other commodities the marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts generated 22 million of unrealized losses for the year ended december 31 2011 

income from operations and sga expenses income from operations increased 68 million to 1092 million for the year ended december 31 2012 principally due to the increase in our gross profit partially offset by the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales our sga expenses improved to 378 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 383 in the prior year sga expenses increased 11 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the prior period the increase was the result of higher labor and benefit costs and an increase in marketing investments these increases were partially offset by lower transportation costs lower professional fees driven by the favorable comparison to the 18 million legal provision associated with the abc litigation recorded during the prior year and the favorable impact of foreign currency on our sga expenses the lower transportation costs were the result of the reclassification of 14 million for certain transportation allowances to our customers from sga expenses to net sales and lower distribution fees as a result of lower ncb volumes from our packaged beverages segment 

interest expense interest income and other income net   interest expense increased 11 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ago period primarily due to higher interest rates associated with the senior notes that we issued during 2011 other income net was 9 million for the year ended december 31 2012 which related primarily to indemnity income associated with the tax indemnity agreement with mondelēz 

provision for income taxes   the effective tax rates for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 were 357 and 346 respectively the prior year effective tax rate included certain state and federal income tax benefits primarily the domestic manufacturing deduction related to the pepsico and cocacola licensing agreements executed in 2010 the impact of these benefits decreased the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2011 by 19 million and 21 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by various risk factors discussed in item 1a risk factors including recession or other economic downturn in the us canada mexico or the caribbean which could result in a reduction in our sales volume similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials 

we believe that the following trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity 

 financing arrangements 

the following descriptions represent our available financing arrangements as of   december 31 2013  as of   december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all covenant requirements fo r our senior unsecured notes unsecured credit agreement and   commercial paper program    

  

commercial paper program

unsecured credit agreement   

on september 25 2012 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured credit agreement the credit agreement which provides for a 500 million  revolving line of credit the revolver borrowings under the revolver bear interest at a floating rate per annum based upon the alternate base rate abr or the eurodollar rate in each case plus an applicable margin which varies based upon our debt ratings rates range from 0000  to 0300  for abr loans and from 0795  to 1300  for eurodollar loans the abr is defined as the greater of a jpmorgan chase banks prime rate b the federal funds effective rate plus 0500  and c the adjusted libor for a one month interest period the adjusted libor is the london interbank offered rate for dollars adjusted for a statutory reserve rate set by the board of governors of the us federal reserve system 

additionally the revolver is available for the issuance of letters of credit and swingline advances not to exceed 75 million  and 50 million  respectively swingline advances will accrue interest at a rate equal to the abr plus the applicable margin letters of credit and swingline advances will reduce on a dollar for dollar basis the amount available under the revolver 

the following table provides amounts utilized and available under the revolver and each sublimit arrangement type as of december 31 2013  in millions 



the credit agreement further provides that we may request at any time subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions that the aggregate commitments under the facility be increased by a total amount not to exceed 250 million  

the credit agreements representations warranties covenants and events of default are generally customary for investment grade credit and include a covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as defined in the credit agreement to annualized consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 300 to 100 tested quarterly upon the occurrence of an event of default among other things amounts outstanding under the credit agreement may be accelerated and the commitments may be terminated our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries on the terms set forth in the credit agreement the credit agreement has a maturity date of september 25 2017 however with the consent of lenders holding more than 50 of the total commitments under the credit agreement and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions we may extend the maturity date for up to two additional oneyear terms 

a n unused commitment fee is payable quarterly to the lenders on the unused portion of the commitments available under the revolver equal to   008   to   020   per annum depending upon our debt ratings   

shelf registration statement 

on february 7 2013 our board authorized us to issue up to 1500 million  of securities from time to time subsequently we filed a wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission effective may 23 2013 which registers an indeterminable amount of securities for future sales as of december 31 2013  we had not issued any securities under this shelf registration statement

liquidity 

based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary 

the following table summarizes our cash activity for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  in millions 



net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in creased 384 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended   december 31 2012  primarily due to the favorable comparison of the 2012 tax payments of 531 million  resulting from the licensing agreements with pepsico and cocacola partially offset by unfavorable working capital comparisons to the prior year 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 301 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to the tax payments of 531 million resulting from the licensing agreements with pepsico and cocacola the impact of the tax payments was partially offset by favorability in our working capital primarily due to improved trade accounts receivable of 91 million which was driven by lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 and higher collections 

net cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities for the year ended   december 31 2013  consisted primarily of purchases of property plant and equipment of 179 million  and cash paid to liquidate the liabilities assumed and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of dp7up west of 10 million  purchases of property plant and equipment have decreased over the prior period in line with our focus on reducing our purchases net of proceeds from disposal of property plant and equipment in an amount slightly below 300 of our current year net sales 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 23 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 driven primarily by lower purchases of property plant and equipment purchases of property plant and equipment decreased for the year ended december 31 2012 over the year ended december 31 2011 in line with our focus on reducing our purchases net of proceeds from disposal of property plant and equipment for the year ended december 31 2012 the amount of these purchases was equal to approximately 350 of net sales while it was approximately 400 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2011

these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations 

cash management 

we fund our liquidity needs from cash flow from operations cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements as commercial paper is now a more significant part of our overall cash management strategy 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 179 million  217 million  and 238 million  for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  respectively capital expenditures have reduced over the last three years as a result of a stronger focus on the return on our discretionary capital expenditures the result of our rci initiatives and reduced infrastructure investments required after our separation from cadbury capital expenditures for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 primarily related to machinery and equipment it investments expansion and replacement of existing cold drink equipment plant improvements and our distribution fleet capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily consisted of expansion of our capabilities in existing facilities cold drink equipment and it investments for new systems 

in 2014  we expect to incur annual capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposals in an amount approximately 300 of our net sales which we expect to fund through cash provided by operating activities 

  

cash and cash equivalents 

as a result of the above items cash and cash equivalents de creased 213 million  since december 31 2012  to 153 million  as of december 31 2013  primarily driven by our decision to hold a minimum amount of cash in the us and use commercial paper as needed for our operating needs 

our cash balances are used to fund working capital requirements scheduled debt and interest payments capital expenditures income tax obligations dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the us annually except when required to fund working capital requirements in those jurisdictions foreign cash balances were 65 million and 109 million as of december 31 2013  and 2012 respectively we accrue tax costs for repatriation as applicable as cash is generated in those foreign jurisdictions

during the first quarter of 2013 we also reacquired the distribution rights for snapple and several other ncb brands in parts of asiapacific from mondelēz 

we may continue to make future acquisitions such as acquisitions of regional bottling companies distributors andor distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage any acquisitions may require additional funding for future capital expenditures and possibly restructuring expenses

contractual commitments and obligations 

we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding the senior unsecured notes payments and commercial paper described in this table 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies as of december 31 2013  in millions 



 

 amounts excluded from our table 

as of december 31 2013  we had 14 million  of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits related interest and penalties classified as a longterm liability the table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment refer to note 12 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  

the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31 2013  was approximately 27 million  this amount is impacted by among other items funding levels plan amendments changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above 

the pension protection act of 2006 was enacted in august 2006 and established among other things new standards for funding of us defined benefit pension plans we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations we did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above 

  

additionally we recorded an estimated 56 million  withdrawal liability for one of the four multiemployer pension plans we currently participate in as we intend to withdraw from this plan as we can not estimate the timing or actual amount of payments until the plan formally assesses us with the withdrawal liability those payments have been excluded from the table above 

refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for further information regarding our single employer and multiemployer plans discussed above 

we have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities we did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control refer to note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  

in general we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are selfinsured for large portions of many different types of claims our insurance liability for our losses related to these programs are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history as of december 31 2013  our insurance liability totaled approximately 136 million  refer to notes 8 and 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements we did not include estimated payments related to our insurance liability in the table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we currently participate in four multiemployer pension plans in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan and us gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets during the second quarter of 2013  the company recognized a 1 million withdrawal liability for one of the collective bargaining units under a multiemployer plan based on the trustees assessment during the fourth quarter of 2013  the company recognized a 56 million withdrawal liability related to local 710 as we intend to withdraw during our upcoming collective bargaining session as a result of these actions the company recognized additional multiemployer pension plan expense of 57 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  there were no additional multiemployer plan expenses recognized during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized additional multiemployer plan expense of 1 million during the year ended december 31 2011 

there are no other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit 

other matters

on october 4 2010 we completed the licensing of certain brands to cocacola following cocacolas acquisition of cocacola enterprises north american bottling business and executed separate agreements pursuant to which cocacola began offering dr pepper and diet dr pepper in local fountain accounts and its freestyle fountain program under the agreements we received a onetime nonrefundable cash payment of 715 million the agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20year renewal periods  and require cocacola to meet certain performance conditions   

under a separate agreement cocacola has agreed to include dr pepper and diet dr pepper brands in its freestyle fountain program the freestyle fountain program agreement has a period of 20 years 

these payments were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25year life of the customer relationships 

  

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of these and other accounting policies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices from time to time we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge or mitigate commercial risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation investing or trading 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars however we have some exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred as of december 31 2013  the impact to our income from operations of a 10 change up or down in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 19 million  on an annual basis 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2013  we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 45 million  maturing at various dates through december 15 2014 

  

interest rate risk 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio through the use of interest rate swaps and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variable rate debt at december 31 2013  the carrying value of our fixedrate debt excluding capital leases was 2453 million  720 million  of which is designated as fair value hedges and exposed to variability in interest rates 

the following table is an estimate of the impact to the fair value hedges that could result from hypothetical interest rate changes during the term of the financial instruments based on debt levels as of december 31 2013  



 

 commodity risks 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of pet diesel fuel corn for high fructose corn syrup aluminum sucrose apple juice concentrate apples and natural gas for use in processing and packaging 

we utilize commodities forward and future contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2013  was a net liability  of 12 million  

as of december 31 2013  the impact of a 10 change up or down in market prices for these commodities where the risk of adverse movements has not been hedged is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 30 million  to our income from operations for the year ending december 31 2014

integrated business model   our integrated business model provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses for example we can focus on maximizing profitability for our company as a whole rather than focusing on profitability generated from either the sale of beverage concentrates or the bottling and distribution of our products additionally our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage our manufacturing and distribution system also enables us to improve focus on our brands especially certain brands such as 7up sunkist soda aw squirt vernors canada dry hawaiian punch and snapple which do not have a large presence in the bottler systems affiliated with the cocacola company cocacola or pepsico inc pepsico 

strong customer relationships   our brands have enjoyed longstanding relationships with many of our top customers we sell our products to a wide range of customers from bottlers and distributors to national retailers large food service and convenience store customers we have strong relationships with some of the largest bottlers and distributors including those affiliated with cocacola and pepsico some of the largest and most important retailers including walmart stores inc walmart the kroger co supervalu inc safeway inc publix super markets inc and target corporation some of the largest food service customers including mcdonalds corporation yum brands inc burger king corp sonic corp wendysarbys group inc jack in the box inc and subway restaurants and convenience store customers including 7eleven inc our portfolio of strong brands operational scale and experience across beverage segments has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with our customers

broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage   as of december 31 2012  we had 18  manufacturing facilities and 115  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in the us as well as three  manufacturing facilities and seven  principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in mexico these facilities use a variety of manufacturi ng processes we have strategically located manufacturing and distribution capabilities enabling us to better align our operations with our customers reduce transportation costs and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches in addition our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and geographically dispersed to ensure our products are available to meet consumer demand we actively manage transportation of our products using our own fleet of approximately 6000  delivery trucks as well as third party logistics providers on a selected basis 

strong operating margins and stable cash flows   the breadth of our brand portfolio has enabled us to generate strong operating margins which have delivered stable cash flows these cash flows enable us to consider a variety of alternatives such as investing in our business repurchasing shares of our common stock paying dividends to our stockholders and reducing our debt 

experienced executive management team   our executive management team has over 200 years of collective experience in the food and beverage industry the team has broad experience in brand ownership manufacturing and distribution and enjoys strong relationships both within the industry and with major customers in addition our management team has diverse skills that support our operating strategies including driving organic growth through targeted and efficient marketing improving productivity of our operations aligning manufacturing and distribution interests and executing strategic acquisitions 

our strategy 

  the key elements of our business strategy are to 

build and enhance leading brands   we have a welldefined portfolio strategy to allocate our marketing and sales resources we use an ongoing process of market and consumer analysis to identify key brands that we believe have the greatest potential for profitable sales growth we intend to continue to invest most heavily in our key brands to drive profitable and sustainable growth by strengthening consumer awareness developing innovative products and extending brands to take advantage of evolving consumer trends improving distribution and increasing promotional effectiveness we also focus on new distribution agreements for emerging highgrowth third party brands in new categories that can use our manufacturing and distribution network we can provide these new brands with distribution capability and resources to grow and they provide us with exposure to growing segments of the market with relatively low risk and capital investment 

increase presence in high margin channels and packages we are focused on improving our product presence in high margin channels such as convenience stores vending machines and small independent retail outlets through increased selling activity and significant investments in coolers and other cold drink equipment we have continued the expanded placement program for our branded coolers and other cold drink equipment and intend to selectively increase the number of those types of equipment where we believe we can achieve an attractive return on investment we also intend to increase demand for high margin products like singleserve packages for many of our key brands through increased instore activity 

leverage our integrated business model we believe our integrated brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business model provides us opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses we intend to continue leveraging our integrated business model to reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage and to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches

trademarks licensed from others we license various trademarks from third parties which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute certain products or brands throughout the us andor canada and mexico for example we license from third parties the sunkist soda welchs country time orangina stewarts roses holland house and margaritaville trademarks although these licenses vary in length and other terms they generally are longterm cover the entire us andor canada and mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor 

licensed distribution rights we have rights in certain territories to bottle andor distribute various brands we do not own such as arizona fiji vita coco and neuro some of these arrangements are relatively shorter in term and limited in geographic scope and the licensor may be able to terminate the agreement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us 

intellectual property we license to others we license some of our intellectual property including trademarks to others for example we license the dr pepper trademark to certain companies for use in connection with food confectionery and other products we also license certain brands such as dr pepper and snapple to third parties for use in beverages in certain countries where we own the brand but do not otherwise operate our business 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to grow our brands through continuously providing new solutions to meet consumers changing preferences and needs we identify these preferences and needs and then develop innovative consumer and shopper programs to address the opportunities solutions include new and reformulated products improved packaging design pricing and enhanced availability we use advertising sponsorships merchandising public relations promotions and social media   to provide maximum impact for our brands and messages 

manufacturing 

as of december 31 2012  we operated 20  manufacturing facilities across the us and mexico excluding our manufacturing facility for our joint venture with acqua minerale san benedetto almost all of our csd beverage concentrates are manufactured at a single plant in st louis missouri all of our manufacturing facilities are either regional manufacturing facilities with the capacity and capabilities to manufacture many brands and packages facilities with particular capabilities that are dedicated to certain brands or products or smaller bottling plants with a more limited range of packaging capabilities 

we employed approximately 6000   fulltime manufacturing employees in our facilities as of december 31 2012  we have a variety of production capabilities including hotfill coldfill and aseptic bottling processes and we manufacture beverages in a variety of packaging materials including aluminum glass and pet cans and bottles and a variety of package formats including singleserve and multiserve packages and baginbox fountain syrup packaging 

in 2012  88  of our manufactured volumes came from our brands and 12  from third party and privatelabel products we also use third party manufacturers to package our products for us on a limited basis 

a s of december 31 2012  and 2011  we owned property plant and equipment net of accumulated depreciation totaling 1117 million   and 1080 million  in the us respectively and 85 million   and 72 million  in international locations respectively

raw materials 

the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially in addition we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses 

under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging manufacturing costs for our packaged beverages segment where we manufacture and bottle finished beverages are higher as a percentage of our net sales than our beverage concentrates segment as the packaged beverages segment requires the purchase of a much larger portion of the packaging and ingredients although we have contracts with a relatively small number of suppliers we have generally not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required amount of raw materials 

when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process through the use of forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of shortterm predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position

we use both nielsen and beverage digest to assess both our own and our competitors performance and market share in the us different market share rankings can result for a specific beverage category depending on whether data from nielsen or beverage digest is used in part because of the differences in the sales channels reported by each source for example because the fountain channel where we have a relatively small business except for dr pepper is not included in nielsen data our market share using nielsen data is generally higher for our csd portfolio than the beverage digest data which does include the fountain channel 

in this annual report on form 10k all information regarding the beverage market in the us is from beverage digest and except as otherwise indicated is from 2011  all information regarding our brand market positions in the us is from nielsen and is based on retail dollar sales in 2012  




 item 1a  risk factors 

risks related to our business 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties could harm our business and financial condition   

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which represent approximately 61 o f the us lrb market by volume according to beverage digest we also compete against other large companies including nestle kraft foods group inc and campbell soup these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we have lower exposure to energy drinks some of the faster growing ncbs and the bottled water segments in the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

if we are unable to compete effectively our sales could decline as a result we would have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations and new or proposed beverage regulations could impact our sales 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see regulatory matters in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations 

violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture safety labeling transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing certain state warning and labeling laws such as californias prop 65 which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects are or could become applicable to our products 

additionally local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types or sizes of soft drinks in municipalities and schools as a result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity in addition federal state local and foreign governments could impose taxes on sugarsweetened beverages as a result of these concerns which could cause us to raise our prices any changes of regulations or imposed taxes may reduce consumer demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors 

consumers preferences can change due to a variety of factors including the age and ethnic demographics of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness and demand for regular csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards low or no calorie soft drinks and increasingly to ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences then quickly develop new products in response our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segments operations generate a significant portion of our overall segment operating profit some of these bottlers such as pepsico and cocacola are also our competitors the majority of these bottlers business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer as a result deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance   

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

changes in economic and financial conditions in the us canada mexico or the caribbean including the outcome of negotiations surrounding the us fiscal cliff tax increases and potential spending cuts may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or our vendors to timely supply materials additionally these disruptions could have a negative impact on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of unsecured commercial paper or senior notes 

we could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedging arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

weather climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns global warming concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

we also may be faced with water availability risks water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations the competition for water among domestic agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even where water is widely available water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations 

costs for raw materials and energy costs may increase substantially 

the principal raw materials we use in our products are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of such raw materials can fluctuate substantially under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging 

in addition we use a significant amount of energy in our business we are significantly impacted by increases in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas 

continued price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers price increases we pass along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

increases in our cost of benefits and multiemployer plan withdrawal liabilities in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care pension and other retirement programs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

additionally the company currently participates in four multiemployer pension plans in the united states our pension expense for us multiemployer plans totaled 5 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  the plans we participate in have collective bargaining agreements which will expire at various points through 2016 in the event that we or in the case of one multiemployer pension plan another large employer withdraw from participation in any of these plans then applicable law could require us to record a withdrawal liability which may be material and could negatively impact our financial performance in the applicable periods 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2012  we had 8928 million  of total assets of which approximately 5667 million  were goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinite lived intangible assets in connection with brands bottler agreements distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of december 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess there was no impairment required based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2012  for additional information about these intangible assets see critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of intangible assets since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which may increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our results of operations 

our total indebtedness could affect our operations and profitability 

we maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our actual and expected cash flows as of december 31 2012  our total indebtedness was 2804 million  

this amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including 

 while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings which include employment tort real estate commercial and other litigation from time to time we are a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts which are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners fruit juice and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation or supply interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various accounting order entry and other transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses hackers other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls liability claims and negative publicity moreover negative publicity also could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions at any one time many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as these audits and negotiations progress events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved as a result there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions in addition our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules tax regulations or interpretations of existing law in addition tax legislation may be enacted in the future domestically or abroad that impacts our effective tax rate 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

as of december 31 2012  approximately   5000  of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see intellectual property and trademarks in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of the trademark and negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license products from third parties that we distribute the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we expect to incur substantial costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

approximately 85  of our 2012  packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our owned and licensed brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as big red arizona fiji neuro vita coco and hydrive we are subject to a risk of our allied brands terminating their distribution agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have key person life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees 

changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results 

the number of new accounting standards or pronouncements is increasing as the financial accounting standards board and the international accounting standards board work towards a convergence of accounting standards certain standards may become applicable for us and change the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements which could have a significant effect on our reported results or financial position for the affected periods

the periods presented in this section are the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  which we refer to as  2012   2011  and  2010  respectively 

overview 

we are a leading integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the united states us canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored carbonated soft drinks csds and noncarbonated beverages ncbs including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper sunkist soda 7up aw canada dry crush squirt peñafiel and schweppes and ncb brands such as snapple motts hawaiian punch clamato roses and mr  mrs t mixers our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the us according to the nielsen company we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers   

we operate as an integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor through our three segments we believe our integrated business model strengthens our routetomarket and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our direct store delivery dsd system and our warehouse direct wd delivery system our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage 

we operate primarily in the us mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2012  89  of our net sales were generated in the united states 4  in canada and 7  in mexico and the caribbean 

trends affecting our business 

we believe the key trends influencing the north american liquid refreshment beverage market include 

 23 

 seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

segments 

we report our business in three operating segments 

 segment results are based on management reports net sales and segment operating profit sop are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of our operating segments 

volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 concentrate case sales and 2 bottler case sales the unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings 

concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases 

although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels 

packaged beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages segment we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

volume in bottler case sales 

in addition to sales volume we measure volume in bottler case sales volume bcs as sales of packaged beverages in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume bcs 

bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

liquidity and capital resources 

trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity 

customer and consumer demand for the companys products may be impacted by various risk factors discussed in item 1a risk factors including recession or other economic downturn in the us canada mexico or the caribbean which could result in a reduction in our sales volume similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact the companys ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials 

we believe that the following trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity

financing arrangements 

the following descriptions represent our available financing arrangements as of december 31 2012  as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with all covenant requirements for our senior unsecured notes and the unsecured credit agreement 

unsecured credit agreement   

on september 25 2012 the company entered into a new fiveyear unsecured credit agreement the credit agreement which provides for a 500 million  revolving line of credit the revolver borrowings under the revolver bear interest at a floating rate per annum based upon the alternate base rate abr or the eurodollar rate in each case plus an applicable margin which varies based upon the companys debt ratings rates range from 0000  to 0300  for abr loans and from 0795  to 1300  for eurodollar loans the abr is defined as the greater of a jpmorgan chase banks prime rate b the federal funds effective rate plus 0500  and c the adjusted libor for a one month interest period the adjusted libor is the london interbank offered rate for dollars adjusted for a statutory reserve rate set by the board of governors of the us federal reserve system 

additionally the revolver is available for the issuance of letters of credit and swingline advances not to exceed 75 million  and 50 million  respectively swingline advances will accrue interest at a rate equal to the abr plus the applicable margin letters of credit and swingline advances will reduce on a dollar for dollar basis the amount available under the revolver 

the following table provides amounts utilized and available under the revolver and each sublimit arrangement type as of december 31 2012  in millions 



the credit agreement further provides that the company may request at any time subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions that the aggregate commitments under the facility be increased by a total amount not to exceed 250 million  

the credit agreements representations warranties covenants and events of default are generally customary for investment grade credit and includes a covenant that requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as defined in the credit agreement to annualized consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 300 to 100 tested quarterly upon the occurrence of an event of default among other things amounts outstanding under the credit agreement may be accelerated and the commitments may be terminated the companys obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of the companys direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries on the terms set forth in the credit agreement the credit agreement has a maturity date of september 25 2017 however the company with the consent of lenders holding more than 50 of the total commitments under the credit agreement and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions may extend the maturity date for up to two additional oneyear terms 

a n unused commitment fee is payable quarterly to the lenders on the unused portion of the commitments available under the revolver equal to 008  to 020  per annum depending upon the companys debt ratings there were no significant unused commitment fees incurred during the year ended   december 31 2012    

commercial paper program 

on december 10 2010 we entered into a commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 500 million  the maturities of the commercial paper will vary but may not exceed 364 days from the date of issue we may issue commercial paper from time to time for general corporate purposes and to refinance our senior unsecured notes maturing within the next twelve months the program is supported by the revolver outstanding commercial paper reduces the amount of borrowing capacity available under the revolver and outstanding amounts under the revolver reduce the commercial paper availability as of december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  we had no outstanding commercial paper 

letters of credit facilities 

the company currently has letter of credit facilities available in addition to the portion of the revolver reserved for issuance of letters of credit under these letter of credit facilities 65 million  is available for the issuance of letters of credit 58 million  of which was utilized as of december 31 2012  and 7 million  remains available for use 

liquidity 

based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary 

the following table summarizes our cash activity for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  in millions 



net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities de creased 302 million  for the year ended   december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended   december 31 2011  primarily due to the tax payments of 531 million  resulting from the licensing agreements with pepsico and cocacola the impact of the tax payments was partially offset by favorability in our working capital accounts payable improved 40 million in 2012 as a result of timing of payments trade accounts receivable improved 91 million driven primarily by lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 and higher collections 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1775 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the year ended december 31 2010 primarily due to the receipt in 2010 of separate onetime nonrefundable cash payments of 900 million from pepsico and 715 million from cocacola which were recorded as deferred revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash provided was 760 million primarily due to net income adjusted for deferred income taxes and noncash depreciation and amortization inventory provided 29 million as a result of a reduction in the inventory onhand as of december 31 2011 trade receivables used 55 million as a result of increased sales in 2011 and accounts payable used 30 million due to the timing of payments in addition net cash provided by operating activities was reduced as a result of 54 million of income tax payments resulting from the licensing agreements with pepsico and cocacola 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 24 million for the year ended   december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended   december 31 2011  driven primarily by lower capital expenditures of 22 million 

the decrease of 8 million in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures of 31 million partially offset by lower proceeds of 15 million from disposal of property plant and equipment in 2011 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended   december 31 2012  primarily consisted of stock repurchases of 400 million  and dividend payments of 284 million

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of 1113 million the 573 million aggregate principal and premium payment made to holders of the 2018 notes in connection with the tender offer described below the 405 million repayment of the revolving credit facility included in our prior senior unsecured credit facility and dividend payments of 194 million 

on december 1 2010 we announced a tender offer to repurchase up to 600 million of our outstanding 2018 notes on december 29 2010 we completed a tender offer and retired at a premium approximately 476 million of aggregate principal of the 2018 notes 

debt ratings

these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations 

cash management 

we fund our liquidity needs from cash flow from operations cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary

cash and cash equivalents 

as a result of the above items cash and cash equivalents de creased 335 million  since december 31 2011  to 366 million  as of december 31 2012  

our cash balances are used to fund working capital requirements scheduled debt and interest payments capital expenditures income tax obligations dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock cash available in our foreign operations may not be immediately available for these purposes foreign cash balances constituted approximately 30  of our total cash position as of december 31 2012  as compared to 9 in the prior year the primary driver of this increase was due to the domestic tax payments of 531 million  made during 2012 resulting from the licensing agreements with pepsico and cocacola which reduced both our us and total cash positions

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices from time to time we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to manage such risks 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars however we have some exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred as of december 31 2012  the impact to our income from operations of a 10 change up or down in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 21 million  on an annual basis 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2012  we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 90 million  maturing at various dates through december 15 2014 

interest rate risk 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio through the use of interest rate swaps and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variable rate debt at december 31 2012  the carrying value of our debt excluding capital leases was 2748 million  470 million  of which is designated as fair value hedges and exposed to variability in interest rates

as of december 31 2012  the impact of a 10 change up or down in market prices for these commodities where the risk of adverse movements has not been hedged is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 32 million  to our income from operations for the year ended december 31 2013

  trademarks licensed from others we license various trademarks from third parties which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute throughout the us andor canada and mexico for example we license from third parties the sunkist soda welch’s country time orangina stewart’s rose’s holland house and margaritaville trademarks although these licenses vary in length and other terms they generally are longterm cover the entire us andor canada and mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor 

licensed distribution rights we have rights in certain territories to bottle andor distribute various brands we do not own such as arizona tea fiji mineral water neuro beverages and vita coco coconut water some of these arrangements are relatively shorter in term are limited in geographic scope and the licensor may be able to terminate the agreement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us

  marketing 

  our marketing strategy is to grow our brands through continuously providing new solutions to meet consumers’ changing preferences and needs we identify these preferences and needs and develop innovative solutions to address the opportunities solutions include new and reformulated products improved packaging design pricing and enhanced availability we use advertising media sponsorships merchandising public relations and promotion to provide maximum impact for our brands and messages 

  manufacturing 

  as of december 31 2011  we operated 20  manufacturing facilities across the us and mexico excluding our manufacturing facility for our joint venture with acqua minerale san benedetto almost all of our csd beverage concentrates are manufactured at a single plant in st louis missouri all of our manufacturing facilities are either regional manufacturing facilities with the capacity and capabilities to manufacture many brands and packages facilities with particular capabilities that are dedicated to certain brands or products or smaller bottling plants with a more limited range of packaging capabilities 

  we employed approximately 5000   fulltime manufacturing employees in our facilities as of december 31 2011  we have a variety of production capabilities including hotfill coldfill and aseptic bottling processes and we manufacture beverages in a variety of packaging materials including aluminum glass and pet cans and bottles and a variety of package formats including singleserve and multiserve packages and baginbox fountain syrup packaging 

  in 2011  89  of our manufactured volumes came from our brands and 11  from third party and privatelabel products we also use third party manufacturers to package our products for us on a limited basis 

  we owned property plant and equipment net of accumulated depreciation totaling 1080 million   and 1092 million  in the us and 72 million   and 76 million  in international locations as of december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively 

warehousing and distribution 

  as of december 31 2011  our distribution network consisted of 116  principal distribution centers and warehouses in the us and seven  principal distribution centers and warehouses in mexico our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and are geographically dispersed to ensure product is available to meet consumer demand we actively manage the sale merchandising and transportation of our products using combination of our own fleet of approximately 6000   delivery vehicles as well as third party logistics providers 

  raw materials 

  the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially in addition we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses 

under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging manufacturing costs for our packaged beverages segment where we manufacture and bottle finished beverages are higher as a percentage of our net sales than our beverage concentrates segment as the packaged beverages segment requires the purchase of a much larger portion of the packaging and ingredients although we have contracts with a relatively small number of suppliers we have generally not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required amount of raw materials 

  when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process through the use of forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of shortterm predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position 

  research and development 

  our research and development team is composed of scientists and engineers in the us and mexico who are focused on developing high quality products which have broad consumer appeal can be sold at competitive prices and can be safely and consistently produced across a diverse manufacturing network our research and development team engages in activities relating to product development microbiology analytical chemistry process engineering sensory science nutrition knowledge management and regulatory compliance we have particular expertise in flavors and sweeteners research and development costs are expensed when incurred and amounted to 15 million   16 million and 15 million for 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively additionally we incurred packaging engineering costs of 6 million  for each of 2011  and 2010  packaging engineering costs   for 2009  were 7 million these expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income

  we use a business process outsourcing provider located in india to provide certain back office transactional processing services including accounting order entry and other transactional services 

  employees 

at december 31 2011  we employed approximately 19000 e mployees 

in the us we have approximately   16000   fulltime employees we have many union collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 4000   fulltime employees several agreements cover multiple locations these agreements often address working conditions as well as wage rates and benefits in mexico and the caribbean we employ approximately 3000 fu lltime employees with approximately 1000  employees party to collective bargaining agreements we do not have a significant number of employees in canada 

we believe we have good relations with our employees 

  regulatory matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business regulations apply to many aspects of our business including our products and their ingredients manufacturing safety labeling transportation recycling advertising and sale for example our products and their manufacturing labeling marketing and sale in the us are subject to various aspects of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal trade commission act the lanham act state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws in canada and mexico the manufacture distribution marketing and sale of our many products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations 

we and our bottlers use various refillable and nonrefillable recyclable bottles and cans in the us and other countries various states and other authorities require deposits ecotaxes or fees on certain containers similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local state and federal levels both in the us and elsewhere in mexico the government has encouraged the soft drinks industry to comply voluntarily with collection and recycling programs of plastic material and we are in compliance with these programs 

  environmental health and safety matters 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to a variety of federal state and local environment health and safety laws and regulations we maintain environmental health and safety policies and a quality environmental health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations the cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations 

  available information 

our web site address is wwwdrpeppersnapplegroupcom information on our web site is not incorporated by reference in this document we make available free of charge through this web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 

  market and industry data 

the market and industry data in this annual report on form 10k is from independent industry sources including nielsen and beverage digest although we believe that these independent sources are reliable we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of this data or any assumptions underlying such data 

nielsen is a marketing information provider primarily serving consumer packaged goods manufacturers and retailers we use nielsen data as our primary management tool to track market performance because it has broad and deep data coverage is based on consumer transactions at retailers and is reported to us monthly nielsen data provides measurement and analysis of marketplace trends such as market share retail pricing promotional activity and distribution across various channels retailers and geographies measured categories provided to us by nielsen scantrack include flavored noncola csds energy drinks singleserve bottled water nonalcoholic mixers and ncbs including readytodrink teas singleserve and multiserve juice and juice drinks and sports drinks nielsen also provides data on other food items such as apple sauce nielsen data we present in this report is from nielsens scantrack service which compiles data based on scanner transactions in certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers drug chains convenience stores and gas stations however this data does not include the fountain or vending channels walmart or small independent retail outlets which together represent a meaningful portion of the us lrb market and of our net sales and volume 

beverage digest is an independent beverage research company that publishes an annual beverage digest fact book we use beverage digest primarily to track market share information and broad beverage and channel trends this annual publication provides a compilation of data supplied by beverage companies beverage digest covers the following categories csds energy drinks bottled water and ncbs including readytodrink teas juice and juice drinks and sports drinks beverage digest data does not include multiserve juice products or bottled water in packages of 15 liters or more data is reported for certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores drug chains convenience stores gas stations fountains vending machines and the “upanddownthestreet” channel consisting of small independent retail outlets 

we use both nielsen and beverage digest to assess both our own and our competitors’ performance and market share in the us different market share rankings can result for a specific beverage category depending on whether data from nielsen or beverage digest is used in part because of the differences in the sales channels reported by each source for example because the fountain channel where we have a relatively small business except for dr pepper is not included in nielsen data our market share using nielsen data is generally higher for our csd portfolio than the beverage digest data which does include the fountain channel 

in this annual report on form 10k all information regarding the beverage market in the us is from beverage digest and except as otherwise indicated is from 2010  all information regarding our brand market positions in the us is from nielsen and is based on retail dollar sales in 2011  




 item 1a risk factors 

  risks related to our business 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties could harm our business and financial condition   

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which represent approximately 62 of the us lrb market by volume according to beverage digest we also compete against other large companies including nestle and kraft these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we have lower exposure to energy drinks some of the faster growing noncarbonated and the bottled water segments in the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

our inability to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales as a result we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors 

consumers preferences can change due to a variety of factors including aging of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness and demand for regular csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards low or no calorie soft drinks and increasingly to ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences then quickly develop new products in response our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products’ retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segments net sales generate a portion of our overall net sales some of these bottlers pepsico and cocacola are our competitors the majority of these bottlers’ business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors’ products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors’ products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance   

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession or other economic downturn in the us canada mexico or the caribbean which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or our vendors to timely supply materials 

we could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedge arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

costs for commodities may increase substantially 

the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale also uses electricity and natural gas the cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially we are significantly impacted by increases in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging continued price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings which include employment tort real estate commercial and other litigation from time to time we are a defendant in class action litigation including litigation regarding employment practices product labeling and wage and hour laws plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts which are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we may establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost of actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation which in turn could adversely affect our results 

increases in our cost of benefits and multiemployer plan withdrawal liabilities in the future could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by the costs of pension postretirement employee medical costs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial performance 

additionally the company currently participates in four multiemployer pension plans in the united states our pension expense for us multiemployer plans totaled 6 million  for the year ended december 31 2011 the plans we participate in have collective bargaining agreements that extend into 2015 in the event that we or in the case of one multiemployer pension plan another large employer withdraw from participation in any of these plans then applicable law could require us to record a withdrawal liability which may be material and could negatively impact our financial performance in the applicable periods 

our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

monster beverage corporation formerly hansen natural corporation and glacéau terminated their distribution agreements with us in 2008 and 2007 respectively we are subject to a risk of other allied brands such as fiji arizona neuro and vita coco terminating their distribution agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2011  we had 93 billion  of total assets of which approximately 57 billion  were goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include both definite and indefinite intangible assets in connection with brands bottler agreements distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of december 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess there was no impairment required based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2011  for additional information about these intangible assets see “critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets” in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of income and our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of intangible assets since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of income which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our total indebtedness could affect our operations and profitability 

we maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our actual and expected cash flows as of december 31 2011  our total indebtedness was 2712 million  

this amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including 

 while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners juice and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we expect to incur substantial costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

as of december 31 2011  approximately   5000  of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various accounting order entry and other transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses hackers other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls and liability claims moreover negative publicity could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations and they could change 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see regulatory matters in item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing certain state warning and labeling laws such as californias prop 65 which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects could become applicable to our products 

some local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in schools any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or disrupt the production or distribution of our products and negatively affect our business and financial performance in addition taxes imposed on the sale of certain of our products by federal state local and foreign governments could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing our products 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see “intellectual property and trademarks” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of the trademark and negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license products from third parties which we distribute the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have “key person” life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees 

weather and climate changes could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns global warming changing weather patterns along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could negatively impact the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that we use to produce our products additionally the sale of our products can be negatively impacted by weather conditions 

concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries that we operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results 

the number of new accounting standards or pronouncements is increasing as the financial accounting standards board and the international accounting standards board work towards a convergence of accounting standards certain standards may become applicable for us and change the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements which could have a significant effect on our reported results or financial position for the affected periods

business overview 

we are a leading integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the united states us canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored carbonated soft drinks csds and noncarbonated beverages ncbs including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper sunkist soda 7up aw canada dry crush squirt peñafiel and schweppes and ncb brands such as snapple mott’s hawaiian punch clamato rose’s and mr  mrs t mixers our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the united states according to the nielsen company we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers   

we operate primarily in the us mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2011  89  of our net sales were generated in the united states 4  in canada and 7  in mexico and the caribbean 

our business model 

our brand ownership businesses as a brand owner we build our brands by promoting brand awareness through marketing advertising and promotion and by developing new and innovative products and product line extensions that address consumer preferences and needs as the owner of the formulas and proprietary knowhow required for the preparation of beverages we manufacture sell and distribute beverage concentrates and syrups used primarily to produce csds and we manufacture sell and distribute primarily finished ncbs most of our sales of beverage concentrates are to bottlers who manufacture bottle sell and distribute our branded products into retail channels we also manufacture sell and distribute syrups for use in beverage fountain dispensers to restaurants and retailers as well as to fountain wholesalers who resell it to restaurants and retailers in addition we distribute finished ncbs through companyowned and third party distributors 

our beverage concentrates and brand ownership businesses are characterized by relatively low capital investment raw materials and employee costs although the cost of building or acquiring an established brand can be significant established brands typically do not require significant ongoing expenditures other than marketing and therefore generate relatively high margins our packaged beverages brand ownership businesses have characteristics of both of our brand ownership businesses as well as our manufacturing and distribution businesses discussed below 

our manufacturing and distribution businesses we manufacture sell and distribute finished csds from concentrates and finished ncbs and products mostly from ingredients other than concentrates we sell and distribute packaged beverages and other products primarily into retail channels either directly to retail shelves or to warehouses through our large fleet of delivery trucks or through third party logistics providers 

our manufacturing and distribution businesses are characterized by relatively high capital investment raw material selling and distribution costs in each case compared to our beverage concentrates and brand ownership businesses our capital costs include investing in and maintaining our companyowned fleet facilities and manufacturing and warehouse equipment our raw material costs include purchasing beverage concentrates ingredients and packaging materials from a variety of suppliers our selling and distribution costs include significant costs related to operating our large fleet of delivery trucks and employing a significant number of employees to sell and deliver finished beverages and other products to retailers as a result of the high fixed costs associated with these types of businesses we are focused on maintaining an adequate level of volumes as well as controlling 

capital expenditures raw material selling and distribution costs in addition geographic proximity to our customers is a critical component of managing the high cost of transporting finished beverages relative to their retail price the profitability of the manufacturing and distribution businesses is also dependent upon our ability to sell our products into higher margin channels as a result of these factors the margins of our manufacturing and distribution businesses are significantly lower than those of our brand ownership businesses in light of the largely fixed cost nature of the manufacturing and distribution businesses increases in costs for example raw materials tied to commodity prices could have a significant negative impact on the margins of our businesses 

approximately 87  of our 2011  packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as big red arizona tea fiji mineral water neuro beverages vita coco coconut water and hydrive energy drinks in addition a small portion of our packaged beverages sales come from fees charged for bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others

 trends affecting our business 

we believe the key trends influencing the north american lrb market include 

 23 

seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

segments 

we report our business in three operating segments beverage concentrates packaged beverages and latin america beverages 

the key financial measures management uses to assess the performance of our segments are net sales and segment operating profit sop 

beverage concentrates 

our beverage concentrates segment is principally a brand ownership business in this segment we manufacture and sell beverage concentrates in the us and canada most of the brands in this segment are csd brands in 2011  our beverage concentrates segment had net sales of approximately 12 billion  key brands include dr pepper canada dry crush schweppes 7up sunkist soda aw sun drop rc cola diet rite squirt welchs country time vernors and the concentrate form of hawaiian punch 

we are the industry leader in flavored csds with a 400  market share in the united states for 2011  as measured by retail sales according to nielsen we are also the third largest csd brand owner as measured by 2011  retail sales in the us and canada and we own a leading brand in most of the csd categories in which we compete 

almost all of our beverage concentrates are manufactured at our plant in st louis missouri 

the beverage concentrates are shipped to third party bottlers as well as to our own manufacturing systems who combine them with carbonation water sweeteners and other ingredients package it in pet containers glass bottles and aluminum cans and sell it as a finished beverage to retailers beverage concentrates are also manufactured into syrup which is shipped to fountain customers such as fast food restaurants who mix the syrup with water and carbonation to create a finished beverage at the point of sale to consumers dr pepper represents most of our fountain channel volume concentrate prices historically have been reviewed and adjusted at least on an annual basis 

our beverage concentrates brands are sold by bottlers including our own packaged beverages segment through all major retail channels including supermarkets fountains mass merchandisers club stores vending machines convenience stores gas stations small groceries drug chains and dollar stores unlike the majority of our other csd brands 70  of dr pepper volumes are distributed through the cocacola affiliated and pepsico affiliated bottler systems 

pepsico and cocacola are the two largest customers of the beverage concentrates segment and constituted approximately 29  and 20  respectively of the segments net sales during 2011   

packaged beverages 

our packaged beverages segment is principally a brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business in this segment we primarily manufacture and distribute packaged beverages and other products including our brands third party owned brands and certain private label beverages in the united states and canada in 2011  our packaged beverages segment had net sales of approximately 43 billion  key ncb brands in this segment include snapple hawaiian punch motts yoohoo clamato deja blue arizona fiji mistic nantucket nectars realemon mr and mrs t roses and country time key csd brands in this segment include 7up dr pepper aw sunkist soda canada dry squirt rc cola big red sun drop diet rite ibc and vernors   

approximately 87  of our 2011  packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as big red arizona tea fiji mineral water neuro beverages vita coco coconut water and hydrive energy drinks a portion of our sales also comes from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others for a fee although the majority of our packaged beverages net sales relate to our brands we also provide a routetomarket for third party brand owners seeking effective distribution for their new and emerging brands these brands give us exposure in certain markets to fast growing segments of the beverage industry with minimal capital investment   

our packaged beverages products are manufactured in multiple facilities across the us and are sold or distributed to retailers and their warehouses by our own distribution network or by third party distributors the raw materials used to manufacture our products include aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juices water and other ingredients 

we sell our packaged beverages products both through our direct store delivery system dsd supported by a fleet of approximately 6000  trucks and 12000 employees including sales representatives merchandisers drivers and warehouse workers as well as through our warehouse direct delivery system wd both of which include the sales to all major retail channels including supermarkets fountain channel mass merchandisers club stores vending machines convenience stores gas stations small groceries drug chains and dollar stores 

in 2011  walmart stores inc the largest customer of our packaged beverages segment accounted for approximately 18  of our net sales in this segment   

latin america beverages 

our latin america beverages segment is a brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business this segment participates mainly in the carbonated mineral water flavored csd bottled water and vegetable juice categories with particular strength in carbonated mineral water and grapefruit flavored csds in 2011  our latin america beverages segment had net sales of 418 million  with our operations in mexico representing approximately 89  of the net sales of this segment key brands include peñafiel squirt clamato and aguafiel 

in mexico we manufacture and distribute our products through our bottling operations and third party bottlers and distributors in the caribbean we distribute our products through third party bottlers and distributors in mexico we also participate in a joint venture to manufacture aguafiel brand water with acqua minerale san benedetto we provide expertise in the mexican beverage market and acqua minerale san benedetto provides expertise in water production and new packaging technologies 

we sell our finished beverages through all major mexican retail channels including mom and pop stores supermarkets hypermarkets and on premise channels 

volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 concentrates case sales and 2 bottler case sales the unit of measurement for both concentrates case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage or 24 twelve ounce servings 

concentrates case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrates case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates cases sold 

although our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates case sales we believe that bottler case sales as defined below are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales both by us and our bottlers of our finished beverages into retail channels 

packaged beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages segment we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our ownedbrands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

volume in bottler case sales 

in addition to sales volume we also measure volume in bottler case sales volume bcs as sales of packaged beverages in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases sold by us and our bottlers to retailers and independent distributors 

bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

consolidated operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operation for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  dollars in millions except per share data 



volume bcs 

volume bcs decreased 1  for the year ended   december 31 2011  compared with the year ended   december 31   2010  in the us and canada volume decreased 1  and in mexico and the caribbean volume increased 4  compared with the year ago period csd volume remained flat  while ncb volume decreased 2  in csds sun drop increased 9 million cases  compared with the year ago period due to the national launch of the brand as a result of growth in our latin america beverages segment peñafiel and squirt increased 4  and 3  respectively dr pepper volume was flat  as sales volume in the prior year was driven by higher volumes a year ago caused by low holiday and summer pricing by a national account that did not recur in 2011 and higher retail pricing in the second half of 2011 which was offset in part by the impact of additional fountain availability and the launch of dr pepper ten in the fourth quarter of 2011 crush declined 9  compared with the year ago period due to decreased promotional activity canada dry 7up aw and sunkist soda our core 4 brands were down 2  compared to the year ago period as a doubledigit decline in sunkist soda mid singledigit decline in 7up and low singledigit decline in aw were partially offset by a doubledigit increase in canada dry due to targeted marketing programs decreases in ncbs were driven by a 9  decrease in motts due to largerthannormal price increases as a result of the significant increase in the cost of apple juice concentrate promotional activities that did not recur in 2011 and a 5  decrease for hawaiian punch as a result of the impact from higher pricing that was partially offset by increased sales volume from package innovation these decreases were partially offset by a 7  increase for snapple as a result of distribution gains and package innovation and an 11  increase for clamato driven primarily by growth in our latin america beverages segment 

net sales 

net sales increased 267 million  or approximately 5  for the year ended   december 31 2011  compared with the year ended   december 31   2010  the increase was attributable to price increases 61 million  as a result of a higher net sales value per case driven by the repatriation of certain brands under the licensing arrangements with pepsico and cocacola 27 million  of incremental revenue recognized under the pepsico and cocacola license arrangements and increased volume in our contract manufacturing 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 25 million  for the year ended   december 31 2011  compared with the year ended   december 31   2010  gross margin of 579  for the year ended   december 31 2011  was lower than the 602  gross margin for the year ended   december 31   2010  primarily due to higher costs for packaging materials sweeteners apple juice concentrate and other commodities the cost of inflation also contributed to a 12 million  lifo inventory provision recorded in the current year compared to a 2 million  inventory provision in the prior year in addition to the effect of this cost inflation we recorded 22 million  of unrealized losses during the year ended   december 31 2011  for the marktomarket activity on commodity derivative contracts versus 1 million  of unrealized gains in the prior year these reductions in our gross margin were partially offset by increases in our product prices and ongoing productivity savings 

the change in the gross margin was also impacted by the favorable comparison of 19 million  of expenses associated with labor copacking unfavorable yield and an underabsorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of the strike at our williamson new york manufacturing facility in the prior year 

income from operations 

income from operations decreased 1 million  to 1024 million  for the year ended   december 31 2011  compared with the year ago period the decrease was primarily attributable to increased selling general and administrative sga expenses and other operating expense income net partially offset by the 25 million  increase in gross profit discussed above sga expenses increased by 24 million  primarily due to higher transportation costs principally due to rising fuel prices partially offset by rcirelated and other productivity savings an 18 million  legal provision associated with litigation against the american bottling company and incremental costs associated with the repatriation of brands favorable items affecting the comparison include the transaction costs associated with the pepsico and cocacola licensing agreements that did not recur the reclassification of certain transportation allowances to our customers from sga expenses to net sales and a reduction in our information technology it investments 

interest expense and other income net 

interest expense decreased   14 million  compared with the year ago period reflecting lower interest rates on our outstanding debt obligations during 2010 and the repayment of our revolving credit facility the revolver in february 2010 

other income net of 12 million  and 21 million  for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively was related primarily to indemnity income associated with the tax sharing and indemnification agreement tax indemnity agreement with kraft for the year ended   december 31   2010  indemnity income of 19 million  included 10 million  of benefits not expected to recur driven by our separation related tax losses and the impact of a canadian audit in 2010 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

in december 2010 the company completed a tender offer on a portion of the 2018 notes and retired at a premium an aggregate principal amount of approximately 476 million the loss on early extinguishment of debt included the 96 million premium for the tender offer a 3 million writeoff of a portion of the debt issuance costs and unamortized discount associated with the 2018 notes and 1 million of associated reacquisition costs there was no loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2011 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  were 346  and 358  respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended   december 31 2011  was primarily driven by certain state and federal income tax benefits principally the domestic manufacturing deduction related to the pepsico and cocacola licensing agreements executed in 2010 the impact of these benefits decreased the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate by 19 million  and 21  respectively these benefits will not recur beyond 2011 the provision for income taxes for the year ended   december 31   2010  also included a 14 million  benefit due to a favorable change of mexican tax law

consolidated operations 

  the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operation for the years ended december 31 2010  and 2009  dollars in millions 

  

volume bcs 

volume bcs increased approximately 2 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the year ended december 31 2009 csds increased 2 and ncbs increased 3 in csds crush increased 18 compared with the year ago period due to expanded distribution the launch of cherry crush during the first quarter of 2010 and the limited time offering of the lime extension dr pepper volume increased 3 compared with the year ago period which resulted from increases in our regular and diet extensions partially offset by decreases in dr pepper cherry and cherry vanilla our core 4 brands were down 1 compared to the year ago period as a high singledigit decline in sunkist soda a mid singledigit decline in 7up and a low singledigit decline in aw were partially offset by a doubledigit increase in canada dry peñafiel volume decreased 8 due to decreased sales to third party distributors squirt volume increased 5 in ncbs 10 growth in snapple was due to the successful restage of the brand the growth of value offerings and increased marketing a 3 increase in motts was the result of new distribution and strong brand support additionally a 6 increase in hawaiian punch was partially offset by declines in third party ncb brands such as arizona 

although volume bcs increased 2 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the year ended december 31 2009 sales volume was flat for the same period the sales volume decreased as a result of a decline in contract manufacturing which is not included in volume bcs and lower concentrate sales as thirdparty bottlers purchased higher levels of concentrate during the fourth quarter of 2009 

in both the us and canada and in mexico and the caribbean volume increased 2 compared with the year ago period 

net sales 

net sales increase d 105 million  or 2  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the increase was primarily attributable to volume increases in ncbs the favorable impact of foreign currency concentrate price increases and 37 million in revenue recognized under the pepsico and cocacola licenses these increases were partially offset by a 53 million decline in contract manufacturing decreases in pricemix primarily attributable to csds and an unfavorable product mix 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 96 million  or 3  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  gross margin of approximately 60 for the year ended december 31 2010 was higher than the approximately 59 gross margin for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the favorable product mix as a result of the decline in contract manufacturing and ongoing supply chain efficiencies partially offset by 19 million of higher expenses associated with labor copacking unfavorable yield and an underabsorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of the strike at our williamson new york manufacturing facility as we continued to produce product and service customers during this work stoppage which ended on september 13 2010 and higher commodity costs 

income from operations 

income from operations decrease d 60 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the year ended december 31 2009  included onetime gains of 62 million primarily related to the termination of certain distribution agreements

there were no restructuring costs for the years ended december 31 2010  and 2009  

sga expenses increased 98 million for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  significant drivers of the increase were primarily due to higher marketing spend related to targeted marketing changes in foreign currency unfavorable comparison of the changes in fair value of commodity derivatives used in the distribution process higher benefit costs the onetime transaction costs associated with pepsico and cocacola agreements increased stockbased compensation costs an unfavorable comparison of the actuarial adjustments for certain insurance plans and higher productivity office investments these increases were partially offset by lower compensation costs and a onetime curtailment gain on certain us postretirement medical plans 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

in december 2010 the company completed a tender offer on a portion of the 2018 notes and retired at a premium an aggregate principal amount of approximately 476 million the loss on early extinguishment of debt included the 96 million premium for the tender offer a 3 million writeoff of a portion of the debt issuance costs and unamortized discount associated with the 2018 notes and 1 million of associated reacquisition costs 

interest expense and other income net

other income net of 21 million  and 22 million in 2010  and 2009  respectively is primarily comprised of indemnity income associated with the tax indemnity agreement with kraft for the year ended december 31 2010 indemnity income of 19 million included 10 million of benefits not expected to recur driven by our separation related tax losses and the impact of a canadian audit in 2010 for the year ended december 31 2009  other income net included 6 million related to indemnity income associated with the tax indemnity agreement and an additional 16 million of onetime separation related items resulting from an audit settlement during the third quarter of 2009 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 358 and 363 respectively the most significant factor affecting this comparison of the effective tax rate between the periods was a favorable change of mexican law which allowed dps to release in 2010 14 million of tax accrued in 2009 when the law was enacted the decrease associated with the change of mexican law was partially offset by increased state tax rates which increased our deferred tax liabilities adjustments made to deferred tax including the adjustment to deferred tax related to a canadian change of law recognized and disclosed in the quarter ended march 31 2010 were not a significant driver for the reduction in the effective tax rate from 2009

net sales increased   93 million  or approximately 9  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the increase  was primarily due to concentrate price increases 37  million in revenue recognized under the pepsico and cocacola licenses as well as a favorable impact of foreign currency concentrate price increases which were effective in january 2010  added an incremental 41  million to net sales during the year ended december 31 2010  these increases were partially offset by the loss of concentrate sales which resulted from the repatriation of brands associated with the pepsico transaction and transfer of concentrate sales in the caribbean to our latin america beverages segment 

sop increased   62 million  or approximately 9  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009   primarily driven by the increase in net sales and lower compensation costs the increase in net sales was partially offset by an increase in marketing spend primarily related to targeted marketing programs for dr pepper sunkist soda and canada dry 

volume bcs increased 1 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the year ended december 31 2009 primarily driven by a 3 increase in dr pepper primarily led by diet and regular dr pepper crush increased 18 primarily driven by expanded distribution the launch of cherry crush in the first quarter of 2010 and the limited time offering of the lime extension these increases were partially offset by a doubledigit decline in hawaiian punch squirt and vernors as well as a 4 decrease in our core 4 brands the decrease in our core 4 brands was primarily driven by a doubledigit decline in 7up and sunkist soda which was partially offset by a high singledigit increase in canada dry the decreases in 7up sunkist soda hawaiian punch squirt and vernors were primarily driven by the repatriation of the brands to our packaged beverages segment and transfer of concentrate sales in the caribbean to our latin america beverages segment

sales volumes decreased 1  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the majority of the decrease was the result of a decline in contract manufacturing which negatively impacted total volume by approximately 3  the decline in contract manufacturing was partially offset by volume growth in our ncb category repatriation of brands associated with the pepsico transaction increased total volume by 1  

total csd volume was flat for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009    volume from the repatriation of the vernors and squirt brands associated with the pepsico transaction increased our csd volume 1 volume for our core 4 brands decreased 1 due to a mid singledigit decline and low singledigit declines in 7up aw and sunkist soda respectively these decreases were partially offset by a doubledigit increase in canada dry due to targeted marketing programs dr pepper volumes declined 1

sop decreased 37 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the decrease was driven primarily by 19 million  of higher expenses associated with labor copacking unfavorable yield and an underabsorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of our strike at our williamson new york manufacturing facility as we continued to produce product and service customers during this work stoppage which ended on september 13 2010 other factors negatively affecting this comparison include decreases in pricemix primarily attributable to csds costs and depreciation associated with the startup of our manufacturing facility in victorville california higher transportation costs higher benefit costs higher commodity costs an unfavorable comparison of the actuarial adjustments for certain insurance plans and a 5 million unfavorable noncash adjustment to rent expense for certain leases these items were partially offset by volume growth in our ncb category ongoing supply chain efficiencies and changes in foreign currency

sales volumes increased 6  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the increase in volume was driven by a transfer of concentrates sales of certain brands in the caribbean from our beverage concentrates segment a 10 increase in squirt due to higher sales to third party bottlers a 31 increase in crush with the continued growth from the introduction of new flavors in a 23 liter value offering as well as additional distribution routes added throughout 2009 and 2010 these volume increases were partially offset by an 8 decrease in peñafiel due to decreased sales to third party distributors driven by increased competition 

net sales increased 25 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ago period primarily due to a 21 million favorable impact of changes in foreign currency and an increase in sales volumes partially offset by an unfavorable impact related to product mix and higher discounts

items impacting the consolidated statements of income 

the following transactions related to the companys separation from cadbury were included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2010  and 2009  in millions 



  

items impacting income taxes 

the consolidated financial statements present the taxes of our stand alone business and contain certain taxes transferred to us at separation in accordance with the tax indemnity agreement this agreement provides for the transfer to us of taxes related to an entity that was part of cadburys confectionery business and therefore not part of our historical consolidated financial statements the consolidated financial statements also reflect that the tax indemnity agreement requires cadbury to indemnify us for these taxes these taxes and the associated indemnity may change over time as estimates of the amounts change changes in estimates will be reflected when facts change and those changes in estimates will be reflected in our consolidated statements of income at the time of the estimate change in addition pursuant to the terms of the tax indemnity agreement if we breach certain covenants or other obligations or we are involved in certain changeincontrol transactions cadbury may not be required to indemnify us for any of these unrecognized tax benefits that are subsequently realized 

kraft acquired cadbury on february 2 2010 and therefore assumes responsibility for cadburys indemnity obligations under the terms of the tax indemnity agreement

liquidity and capital resources 

trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity 

customer and consumer demand for the companys products may be impacted by recession or other economic downturn in the united states canada mexico or the caribbean which could result in a reduction in our sales volume similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact the companys ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or our vendors to timely supply materials 

the company could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedge arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect the companys pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

we believe that the following trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity

liquidity 

based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements if necessary 

the following table summarizes our cash activity for the year ended   december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  in millions 



  

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1775 million  for the year ended   december 31 2011  compared with the year ago period primarily due to the receipt in 2010 of separate onetime nonrefundable cash payments of 900 million from pepsico and 715 million from cocacola which were recorded as deferred revenue for the year ended   december 31 2011  net cash provided was 760 million  primarily due to net income adjusted for deferred income taxes and noncash depreciation and amortization inventory provided 29 million  as a result of a reduction in the inventory onhand as of december 31 2011  trade receivables used 55 million  as a result of increased sales in 2011  and accounts payable used 30 million  due to the timing of payments in addition net cash provided by operating activities was reduced as a result of 54 million of income tax payments resulting from the licensing agreements with pepsico and cocacola 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1670 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the 1665 million increase in net operating assets was primarily due to the receipt of separate onetime nonrefundable cash payments of 900 million  from pepsico and 715 million  from cocacola both recorded as deferred revenue 

net cash used in investing activities 

the decrease of 8 million  in cash used in investing activities for the year ended   december 31 2011  compared with the year ended   december 31 2010  was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures of 31 million and lower proceeds of 15 million from disposal of property plant and equipment in 2011 

the decrease of 26 million  in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures of 71 million and higher proceeds of 13 million from disposal of property plant and equipment in 2010 partially offset by the absence of the onetime cash receipts in 2009 of 68 million primarily from the termination of certain distribution agreements

  offbalance sheet arrangements

other matters 

agreement with pepsico 

on february 26 2010 the company completed the licensing of certain brands to pepsico following pepsicos acquisitions of pbg and pas 

under the licensing agreements pepsico began distributing dr pepper crush and schweppes in the us territories where these brands were previously being distributed by pbg and pas the same applies to dr pepper crush schweppes vernors and sussex in canada and squirt and canada dry in mexico 

additionally in us territories where it has a distribution footprint dps is selling certain owned and licensed brands including sunkist soda squirt vernors and hawaiian punch that were previously distributed by pbg and pas 

under the agreements dps received a onetime nonrefundable cash payment of 900 million  the agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20 year renewal periods  and require pepsico to meet certain performance conditions the payment was recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25 year life of the customer relationship 

agreement with the cocacola company 

on october 4 2010 the company received a onetime nonrefundable cash payment of 715 million  completed the licensing of certain brands to cocacola following cocacolas acquisition of cces north american bottling business and executed separate agreements pursuant to which cocacola began offering dr pepper and diet dr pepper in local fountain accounts and the freestyle fountain program 

under the licensing agreements cocacola distributes dr pepper in the us and canada dry in the northeast us where these brands were previously being distributed by cce the same applies to canada dry and c plus in canada as part of the us licensing agreement cocacola offers dr pepper and diet dr pepper in its local fountain accounts the agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20 year renewal periods and require cocacola to meet certain performance conditions

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary actual amounts may differ from these estimates and judgments we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting estimates see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred 1 delivery 2 persuasive evidence of an agreement exists 3 pricing is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the customer and us the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on contract terms for sales to customers that are designated in the contract as freeonboard destination revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to and accepted at the customer’s delivery site net sales are reported net of costs associated with customer marketing programs and incentives as described below as well as sales taxes and other similar taxes 

multiple deliverables were included in the arrangements entered into with pepsico and cocacola during 2010 in this case we first determined whether each deliverable met the separation criteria under us gaap the primary requirement for a deliverable to meet the separation criteria is if the deliverable has standalone value to the customer each deliverable that meets the separation criteria is considered a separate unit of accounting as the sale of the manufacturing and distribution rights and the ongoing sales of concentrate would not have standalone value to the customer both deliverables represent a single element of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition the onetime nonrefundable cash receipts from pepsico and cocacola were therefore recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25 year life of the customer relationship 

customer marketing programs and incentives 

the company offers a variety of incentives and discounts to bottlers customers and consumers through various programs to support the distribution of its products these incentives and discounts include cash discounts price allowances volume based rebates product placement fees and other financial support for items such as trade promotions displays new products consumer incentives and advertising assistance these incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales the aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately 3733 million  3686 million  and 3419 million  for the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively during 2009 the company upgraded its sap platform in dsd as part of the upgrade dps harmonized its gross list price structure across locations the impact of the change increased gross sales and related discounts by equal amounts on customer invoices net sales were not affected the amounts of trade spend are larger in our packaged beverages segment than those related to other parts of our business accruals are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms volumebased metrics andor historical trends and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels 

goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 

in accordance with us gaap we classify intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill the majority of our intangible asset balance is made up of brands which we have determined to have indefinite useful lives in arriving at the conclusion that a brand has an indefinite useful life management reviews factors such as size diversification and market share of each brand management expects to acquire hold and support brands for an indefinite period through consumer marketing and promotional support we also consider factors such as our ability to continue to protect the legal rights that arise from these brand names indefinitely or the absence of any regulatory economic or competitive factors that could truncate the life of the brand name if the criteria are not met to assign an indefinite life the brand is amortized over its expected useful life 

we conduct tests for impairment in accordance with us gaap for intangible assets with definite lives we conduct tests for impairment if conditions indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives we conduct tests for impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising 

from each business combination and also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units we define reporting units as beverage concentrates latin america beverages and packaged beverages’ two reporting units dsd and wd 

the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is recorded the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges step 1 if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is indicated and a second step step 2 analysis must be performed 

the tests for impairment include significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the reporting units and intangible assets primarily by analyzing forecasts of future revenues and profit performance fair value is based on what the reporting units and intangible assets would be worth to a third party market participant discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt adjusted with various risk premiums these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various of the risks discussed in risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

2011 impairment analysis 

based on our review of the facts and circumstances and updated assumptions we did not recalculate the fair values for the annual impairment analysis of our goodwill brands or distribution rights during 2011 we employed a carryforward approach in accordance with us gaap since we concluded it was remote that changes in the facts and circumstances would have caused the fair value of these assets to fall below their carrying amounts this conclusion was based on the following factors 1 the fair value of our goodwill brands and distribution rights exceeded their carrying amounts by a substantial margin in the 2010 annual impairment analysis performed 2 our business performance during 2011 was in line with our forecast used to estimate fair value in the impairment analysis performed during 2010 3 our outlook for 2012 and beyond is in line with the forecast used to estimate fair value in the impairment analysis performed during 2010 4 other significant assumptions used in estimating fair value such as our weighted average cost of capital have improved since the 2010 impairment analysis performed 5 the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting units have not changed significantly since the 2010 fair value determination and 6 we have experienced significant appreciation in our market capitalization as such no impairment was required for our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill as of december 31 2011  

2010 and 2009 impairment analyses 

fair value is measured based on what each intangible asset or reporting unit would be worth to a third party market participant for our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2010  and 2009  methodologies used to determine the fair values of the assets included an income based approach as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and our enterprise value managements estimates of fair value which fall under level 3 are based on historical and projected operating performance discount rates were based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt and were adjusted with various risk premiums 

as of december 31 2010  and 2009  the results of the step 1 analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values and therefore were not impaired   

pension and postretirement benefits 

we have several pension and postretirement plans covering employees who satisfy age and length of service requirements there are five standalone noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and six standalone postretirement plans depending on the plan pension and postretirement benefits are based on a combination of factors which may include salary age and years of service 

pension expense has been determined in accordance with the principles of us gaap our policy is to fund pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions employee demographic data years of service compensation benefits and claims paid and employer contributions 

the expense related to the postretirement plans has been determined in accordance with us gaap we accrue the cost of these benefits during the years that employees render service to us 

the calculation of pension and postretirement plan obligations and related expenses is dependent on several assumptions used to estimate the present value of the benefits earned while the employee is eligible to participate in the plans the key assumptions we use in determining the plan obligations and related expenses include 1 the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities 2 employee turnover retirement age and mortality and 3 the expected return on plan assets our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance due to the significant judgment 

required our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and postretirement obligations and expenses refer to note 13 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

the effect of a 1 increase or decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the pension benefit obligations for us plans would change the benefit obligation as of december 31 2011  by approximately   27 million   and 30 million  respectively the effect of a 1 increase or decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended december 31 2011  by approximately 1 million  ea ch the effect of a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended december 31 2011  by approximately 2 million  each 

risk management programs 

we retain selected levels of property casualty workers compensation health and other business risks many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or selfinsured retentions accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty and health risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends these loss development factors are established in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries at december 31 2011  and 2010  we had accrued liabilities related to the retained risks of 89 million  and 80 million  respectively including both current and longterm liabilities 

we believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our selfinsured liabilities however the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known the final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents medical cost inflation legislative actions uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under us gaap this method involves determining the temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and the corresponding amounts recognized for tax purposes and computing the taxrelated carryforwards at the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the resulting amounts are deferred tax assets or liabilities and the net changes represent the deferred tax expense or benefit for the year the total of taxes currently payable per the tax return and the deferred tax expense or benefit represents the income tax expense or benefit for the year for financial reporting purposes 

we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings our estimate of current and expected future earnings prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and current and future ownership changes 

as of december 31 2011  and 2010  undistributed earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in nonus subsidiaries totaled approximately   244 million  a nd 203 million  respectively deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income as the company believes these earnings to be permanently reinvested it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on these undistributed foreign earnings 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to various factors including but not limited to total earnings and the mix of earnings by jurisdiction the timing of changes in tax laws and the amount of tax provided for uncertain tax positions 

we establish income tax reserves to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following 1 the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained 2 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but for a lesser amount or 3 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken our evaluation of whether or not a tax position is uncertain is based on the following 1 we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 2 the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position and 3 each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken we adjust these income tax reserves when our judgment changes as a result of new information any change will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 

effect of recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements 

acquisitions 

we may make future acquisitions for example we may make acquisitions of regional bottling companies distributors and distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage any acquisitions may require future capital expenditures and restructuring expenses 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars however we have some exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred as of december 31 2011  the impact to net income of a 10 change up or down in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 19 million  on an annual basis 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates for the period ending december 31 2011  we had contracts outstanding with a notional value of 135 million  maturing at various dates through december 15 2014 

interest rate risk 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variable rate debt at december 31 2011  the carrying value of our debt excluding capital leases was 2701 million  of which 350 million of the 2019 2021 and 2038 notes are designated as fair value hedges and are exposed to variability in interest rates 

the following table is an estimate of the impact to the fair value hedges on the 2019 2021 and 2038 notes that could result from hypothetical interest rate changes during the twelve months ending december 31   2012  based on debt levels as of december 31 2011  



 

1 we pay an average floating rate which fluctuates periodically based on libor and a credit spread as a result of designated fair value hedges on certain debt instruments see note 9 for further information our weighted average libor rate as of december 31 2011  was 074 as libor has not historically fallen below 025 our estimate of the annual impact to interest expense reflects this assumption if our hypothetical change in the interest rate fell below the historical threshold 

  

commodity risks 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of pet diesel fuel corn for high fructose corn syrup aluminum sucrose apple juice concentrate and natural gas for use in processing and packaging 

we utilize commodities forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2011  was a net liability  of 12 million  

as of december 31 2011  the impact to net income of a 10 change up or down in market prices of these commodities is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately 32 million  on an annual basis

under the new licensing agreements cocacola distributes dr pepper in the us and canada dry in the northeast territories where these brands were formerly distributed by cce the same will apply to canada dry and c plus in canada as part of the us licensing agreement cocacola has agreed to offer dr pepper and diet dr pepper in its local fountain accounts the new agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20year renewal periods and will require cocacola to meet certain performance conditions 

  

under a separate agreement cocacola has agreed to include dr pepper and diet dr pepper brands in its freestyle fountain program the freestyle fountain program agreement has a period of 20 years additionally in certain us territories where it has a distribution footprint we will begin selling in early 2011 certain owned and licensed brands including canada dry schweppes squirt and cactus cooler that were previously distributed by cce 

  

under these arrangements we received a onetime nonrefundable cash payment of 715 million which was recorded net as no competent or verifiable evidence of fair value could be determined for the significant elements in this arrangement the total cash consideration was recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25year life of the customer relationship 

  customers 

  we primarily serve two groups of customers 1 bottlers and distributors and 2 retailers 

  bottlers buy beverage concentrates from us and in turn they manufacture bottle sell and distribute finished beverages bottlers also manufacture and distribute syrup for the fountain foodservice channel in addition bottlers and distributors purchase finished beverages from us and sell them to retail and other customers we have strong relationships with bottlers affiliated with cocacola and pepsico primarily because of the strength and market position of our key dr pepper brand 

retailers also buy finished beverages directly from us our portfolio of strong brands operational scale and experience in the beverage industry has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with major retailers in the us canada and mexico in 2010  our largest retailer was walmart stores inc representing approximately 14 of our net sales 

  seasonality 

  the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

  competition 

  the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which collectively represent approximately 63  of the us lrb market by volume according to beverage digest we also compete against other large companies including nestlé sa “nestle” and kraft foods inc “kraft” these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as the cott corporation “cott” smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we have lower exposure to some of the faster growing noncarbonated and the bottled water segments in the overall lrb market after several years of increased market share in the overall us csd market combined with share loss in the overall us lrb market we have shown increases in market share in both the overall us csd market and the overall us lrb market according to beverage digest in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

  although these bottlers and distributors are our competitors many of these companies are also our customers as they purchase beverage concentrates from us 

  intellectual property and trademarks 

  our intellectual property we possess a variety of intellectual property rights that are important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets to safeguard our proprietary rights including our brands and ingredient and production formulas for our products 

  our trademarks our trademark portfolio includes more than 2500 registrations and applications in the us canada mexico and other countries brands we own through various subsidiaries in various jurisdictions include dr pepper 7up aw canada dry rc cola schweppes squirt crush peñafiel sun drop aguafiel snapple mott’s hawaiian punch clamato mistic nantucket nectars mr  mrs t realemon venom and deja blue we own trademark registrations for most of these brands in the us and we own trademark registrations for some but not all of these brands in canada mexico and other countries we also own a number of smaller regional brands some of our other trademark registrations are in countries where we do not currently have any significant level of business in addition in many countries outside the us canada and mexico our rights to many of our brands including our dr pepper trademark and formula were sold by cadbury beginning over a decade ago to third parties including in certain cases to competitors such as cocacola 

  trademarks licensed from others we license various trademarks from third parties which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute throughout the us andor canada and mexico for example we license from third parties the sunkist soda welch’s country time orangina stewart’s rose’s holland house and margaritaville trademarks although these licenses vary in length and other terms they generally are longterm cover the entire us andor canada and mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor 

licensed distribution rights we have rights in certain territories to bottle andor distribute various brands we do not own such as arizona tea and fiji mineral water some of these arrangements are relatively shorter in term are limited in geographic scope and the licensor may be able to terminate the agreement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us 

  intellectual property we license to others we license some of our intellectual property including trademarks to others for example we license the dr pepper trademark to certain companies for use in connection with food confectionery and other products we also license certain brands such as dr pepper and snapple to third parties for use in beverages in certain countries where we own the brand but do not otherwise operate our business 

  marketing 

  our marketing strategy is to grow our brands through continuously providing new solutions to meet consumers’ changing preferences and needs we identify these preferences and needs and develop innovative solutions to address the opportunities solutions include new and reformulated products improved packaging design pricing and enhanced availability we use advertising media sponsorships merchandising public relations and promotion to provide maximum impact for our brands and messages 

  manufacturing 

  as of december 31 2010  we operated 21 manufacturing facilities across the us and mexico almost all of our csd beverage concentrates are manufactured at a single plant in st louis missouri all of our manufacturing facilities are either regional manufacturing facilities with the capacity and capabilities to manufacture many brands and packages facilities with particular capabilities that are dedicated to certain brands or products or smaller bottling plants with a more limited range of packaging capabilities 

  we employed approximately 5000 fulltime manufacturing employees in our facilities as of december 31 2010 including seasonal workers we have a variety of production capabilities including hotfill coldfill and aseptic bottling processes and we manufacture beverages in a variety of packaging materials including aluminum glass and pet cans and bottles and a variety of package formats including singleserve and multiserve packages and “baginbox” fountain syrup packaging 

  in 2010  90 of our manufactured volumes came from our brands and 10 from third party and privatelabel products we also use third party manufacturers to package our products for us on a limited basis 

  we owned property plant and equipment net of accumulated depreciation totaling 1092 million and 1044 million in the us and 76 million and 65 million in international locations as of december 31 2010 and 2009  respectively 

warehousing and distribution 

  as of december 31 2010  our distribution network consisted of 174 distribution centers in the us and 23 distribution centers in mexico our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and are geographically dispersed to ensure product is available to meet consumer demand we actively manage transportation of our products using combination of our own fleet of more than 5000 delivery trucks as well as third party logistics providers 

  raw materials 

  the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially in addition we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses 

under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging manufacturing costs for our packaged beverages segment where we manufacture and bottle finished beverages are higher as a percentage of our net sales than our beverage concentrates segment as the packaged beverages segment requires the purchase of a much larger portion of the packaging and ingredients although we have contracts with a relatively small number of suppliers we have generally not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required amount of raw materials 

  when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process through the use of forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure 

  research and development 

  our research and development team is composed of scientists and engineers in the us and mexico who are focused on developing high quality products which have broad consumer appeal can be sold at competitive prices and can be safely and consistently produced across a diverse manufacturing network our research and development team engages in activities relating to product development microbiology analytical chemistry process engineering sensory science nutrition knowledge management and regulatory compliance we have particular expertise in flavors and sweeteners research and development costs are expensed when incurred and amounted to 16 million  15 million and 17 million for 2010  2009 and 2008  respectively additionally we incurred packaging engineering costs of 6 million  7 million and 4 million for 2010  2009 and 2008  respectively these expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 

  information technology and transaction processing services 

  we use a variety of it systems and networks configured to meet our business needs our primary it data center is hosted in toronto canada by a third party provider we also use a third party vendor for application support and maintenance which is based in india and provides resources offshore and onshore 

  we use a business process outsourcing provider located in india to provide certain back office transactional processing services including accounting order entry and other transactional services 

  employees 

  at december 31 2010  we employed approximately 19000 e mployees including seasonal and parttime workers 

  in the us we have approximately 16000   fulltime employees we have many union collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 4000 fulltime employees several agreements cover multiple locations these agreements often address working conditions as well as wage rates and benefits in mexico and the caribbean we employ approximately 3000 fu lltime employees with approximately 1000 employees party to collective bargaining agreements we do not have a significant number of employees in canada 

  we believe we have good relations with our employees 

  regulatory matters 

  we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business regulations apply to many aspects of our business including our products and their ingredients manufacturing safety labeling transportation recycling advertising and sale for example our products and their manufacturing labeling marketing and sale in the us are subject to various aspects of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal trade commission act the lanham act state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws in canada and mexico the manufacture distribution marketing and sale of our many products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations 

  we and our bottlers use various refillable and nonrefillable recyclable bottles and cans in the us and other countries various states and other authorities require deposits ecotaxes or fees on certain containers similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local state and federal levels both in the us and elsewhere in mexico the government has encouraged the soft drinks industry to comply voluntarily with collection and recycling programs of plastic material and we have taken steps to comply with these programs 

  environmental health and safety matters 

  in the normal course of our business we are subject to a variety of federal state and local environment health and safety laws and regulations we maintain environmental health and safety policies and a quality environmental health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations the cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations 

  available information 

  our web site address is wwwdrpeppersnapplegroupcom information on our web site is not incorporated by reference in this document we make available free of charge through this web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 

  market and industry data 

  the market and industry data in this annual report on form 10k is from independent industry sources including the nielsen company and beverage digest although we believe that these independent sources are reliable we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of this data or any assumptions underlying such data 

  the nielsen company is a marketing information provider primarily serving consumer packaged goods manufacturers and retailers we use the nielsen company data as our primary management tool to track market performance because it has broad and deep data coverage is based on consumer transactions at retailers and is reported to us monthly the nielsen company data provides measurement and analysis of marketplace trends such as market share retail pricing promotional activity and distribution across various channels retailers and geographies measured categories provided to us by the nielsen company scantrack include flavored noncola csds energy drinks singleserve bottled water nonalcoholic mixers and ncbs including readytodrink teas singleserve and multiserve juice and juice drinks and sports drinks the nielsen company also provides data on other food items such as apple sauce the nielsen company data we present in this report is from the nielsen companys scantrack service which compiles data based on scanner transactions in certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers drug chains convenience stores and gas stations however this data does not include the fountain or vending channels walmart or small independent retail outlets which together represent a meaningful portion of the us lrb market and of our net sales and volume 

  beverage digest is an independent beverage research company that publishes an annual beverage digest fact book we use beverage digest primarily to track market share information and broad beverage and channel trends this annual publication provides a compilation of data supplied by beverage companies beverage digest covers the following categories csds energy drinks bottled water and ncbs including readytodrink teas juice and juice drinks and sports drinks beverage digest data does not include multiserve juice products or bottled water in packages of 15 liters or more data is reported for certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores drug chains convenience stores gas stations fountains vending machines and the “upanddownthestreet” channel consisting of small independent retail outlets 

we use both the nielsen company and beverage digest to assess both our own and our competitors’ performance and market share in the us different market share rankings can result for a specific beverage category depending on whether data from the nielsen company or beverage digest is used in part because of the differences in the sales channels reported by each source for example because the fountain channel where we have a relatively small business except for dr pepper is not included in the nielsen company data our market share using the nielsen company data is generally higher for our csd portfolio than the beverage digest data which does include the fountain channel 

in this annual report on form 10k all information regarding the beverage market in the us is from beverage digest and except as otherwise indicated is from 2009  all information regarding our brand market positions in the us is from the nielsen company and is based on retail dollar sales in 2010  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  risks related to our business 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties could harm our business and financial condition   

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the lrb industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the lrb market are cocacola and pepsico which represent approximately 63 of the us liquid refreshment beverage market by volume according to beverage digest we also compete against other large companies including nestle and kraft these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler and manufacturer we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we have lower exposure to some of the faster growing noncarbonated and the bottled water segments in the overall lrb market in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

our inability to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales as a result we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors 

consumers’ preferences can change due to a variety of factors including aging of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness and demand for regular csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards low or no calorie soft drinks and increasingly to ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences then quickly develop new products in response our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

food and beverage retailers in the us have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products’ retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segments net sales generate a portion of our overall net sales some of these bottlers are our competitors as pepsico purchased pbg and pas and cocacola acquired cce’s north american bottling business during 2010  the majority of these bottlers’ business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors’ products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors’ products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance   

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession or other economic downturn in the us canada mexico or the caribbean which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or our vendors to timely supply materials 

we could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedge arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2010  we had 89 billion of total assets of which approximately 57 billion were intangible assets intangible assets include goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with brands bottler agreements distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of december 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess there was no impairment required based upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2010  for additional information about these intangible assets see “critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets” in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of intangible assets since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our consolidated statements of operations which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our total indebtedness could affect our operations and profitability 

we maintain levels of debt we consider prudent based on our cash flows as of december 31 2010  our total indebtedness was 2094 million  subsequent to december 31 2010  the company issued an additional 500 million of senior unsecured notes 

this amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including 

 while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and will have access to additional sources of capital in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control 

we may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations and they could change 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the us canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see “regulatory matters” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing certain state warning and labeling laws such as californias “prop 65” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects could become applicable to our products 

some local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in schools any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or disrupt the production or distribution of our products and negatively affect our business and financial performance in addition taxes imposed on the sale of certain of our products by federal state local and foreign governments could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing our products for example some members of the us federal government have raised the possibility of a federal tax on the sale of certain “sugared” beverages including nondiet soft drinks fruit drinks teas and flavored waters to help pay for the cost of healthcare reform some us state governments are also considering similar taxes if enacted such taxes could materially affect our business and financial results 

our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

hansen natural corporation and glacéau terminated their distribution agreements with us in 2008 and 2007 respectively we are subject to a risk of other allied brands such as fiji and arizona terminating their distribution agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we evaluate these claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we may establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims or proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance for more information see note 20 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 

benefits cost increases could reduce our profitability 

our profitability is substantially affected by the costs of pension postretirement employee medical costs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial performance 

costs for our raw materials may increase substantially 

the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale also uses electricity and natural gas the cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially we are significantly impacted by increases in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging continued price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

we have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we expect to incur substantial costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

as of december 31 2010  approximately 4000 of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls and liability claims moreover negative publicity could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see “intellectual property and trademarks” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the us canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of the trademark and negatively impact our brands 

in some cases we license products from third parties which we distribute the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have “key person” life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees 

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various accounting order entry and other transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses hackers other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

weather and climate changes could adversely affect our business 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns “global warming” changing weather patterns along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could negatively impact the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that we use to produce our products additionally the sale of our products can be negatively impacted by weather conditions 

concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries that we operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results 

changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results 

the number of new accounting standards or pronouncements is increasing as the financial accounting standards board and the international accounting standards board work towards a convergence of accounting standards certain standards may become applicable to us and change the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements which could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods

business overview 

we are a leading integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the united states us canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored carbonated soft drinks “csds” and noncarbonated beverages “ncbs” including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper sunkist soda 7up aw canada dry crush squirt peñafiel schweppes and venom energy and ncb brands such as snapple mott’s hawaiian punch clamato rose’s and mr  mrs t mixers our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the united states according to the nielsen company we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers   

we operate primarily in the us mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2010  89 of our net sales were generated in the united states 4 in canada and 7 in mexico and the caribbean 

our business model 

our brand ownership businesses as a brand owner we build our brands by promoting brand awareness through marketing advertising and promotion and by developing new and innovative products and product line extensions that address consumer preferences and needs as the owner of the formulas and proprietary knowhow required for the preparation of beverages we manufacture sell and distribute beverage concentrates and syrups used primarily to produce csds and we manufacture sell and distribute primarily finished ncbs most of our sales of beverage concentrates are to bottlers who manufacture bottle sell and distribute our branded products into retail channels we also manufacture sell and distribute syrups for use in beverage fountain dispensers to restaurants and retailers as well as to fountain wholesalers who resell it to restaurants and retailers in addition we distribute finished ncbs through companyowned and third party distributors 

our beverage concentrates and brand ownership businesses are characterized by relatively low capital investment raw materials and employee costs although the cost of building or acquiring an established brand can be significant established brands typically do not require significant ongoing expenditures other than marketing and therefore generate relatively high margins our packaged beverages brand ownership businesses have characteristics of both of our brand ownership businesses as well as our manufacturing and distribution businesses discussed below 

our manufacturing and distribution businesses we manufacture sell and distribute finished csds from concentrates and finished ncbs and products mostly from ingredients other than concentrates we sell and distribute packaged beverages and other products primarily into retail channels either directly to retail shelves or to warehouses through our large fleet of delivery trucks or through third party logistics providers 

our manufacturing and distribution businesses are characterized by relatively high capital investment raw material selling and distribution costs in each case compared to our beverage concentrates and brand ownership businesses our capital costs include investing in and maintaining our companyowned fleet and manufacturing and warehouse equipment and facilities our raw material costs include purchasing beverage concentrates ingredients and packaging materials from a variety of suppliers our selling and distribution costs include significant costs related to operating our large fleet of delivery trucks and employing a significant number of employees to sell and deliver finished beverages and other products to retailers as a result of the high fixed costs associated with these types of businesses we are focused on maintaining an adequate level of volumes 

as well as controlling capital expenditures raw material selling and distribution costs in addition geographic proximity to our customers is a critical component of managing the high cost of transporting finished beverages relative to their retail price the profitability of the manufacturing and distribution businesses is also dependent upon our ability to sell our products into higher margin channels as a result of these factors the margins of our manufacturing and distribution businesses are significantly lower than those of our brand ownership businesses in light of the largely fixed cost nature of the manufacturing and distribution businesses increases in costs for example raw materials tied to commodity prices could have a significant negative impact on the margins of our businesses 

approximately 87 of our 2010 packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as fiji mineral water and arizona tea in addition a small portion of our packaged beverages sales come from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others for a fee 

integrated business model we believe our integrated business model 

 trends affecting our business 

we believe the key trends influencing the north american liquid refreshment beverage market include 

 seasonality 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

segments 

we report our business in three operating segments beverage concentrates packaged beverages and latin america beverages 

the key financial measures management uses to assess the performance of our segments are net sales and segment operating profit loss “sop” 

beverage concentrates 

our beverage concentrates segment is principally a brand ownership business in this segment we manufacture and sell beverage concentrates in the us and canada most of the brands in this segment are csd brands in 2010  our beverage concentrates segment had net sales of approximately 12 billion  key brands include dr pepper crush canada dry sunkist soda schweppes 7up aw rc cola squirt sun drop diet rite welch’s country time vernors and the concentrate form of hawaiian punch 

we are the industry leader in flavored csds with a 404 market share in the united states for 2010  as measured by retail sales according to the nielsen company we are also the third largest csd brand owner as measured by 2010 retail sales in the us and canada and we own a leading brand in most of the csd categories in which we compete 

almost all of our beverage concentrates are manufactured at our plant in st louis missouri 

the beverage concentrates are shipped to third party bottlers as well as to our own manufacturing systems who combine them with carbonation water sweeteners and other ingredients package it in pet containers glass bottles and aluminum cans and sell it as a finished beverage to retailers beverage concentrates are also manufactured into syrup which is shipped to fountain customers such as fast food restaurants who mix the syrup with water and carbonation to create a finished beverage at the point of sale to consumers dr pepper represents most of our fountain channel volume concentrate prices historically have been reviewed and adjusted at least on an annual basis 

our beverage concentrates brands are sold by bottlers including our own packaged beverages segment through all major retail channels including supermarkets fountains mass merchandisers club stores vending machines convenience stores gas stations small groceries drug chains and dollar stores unlike the majority of our other csd brands 71 of dr pepper volumes are distributed through the cocacola affiliated and pepsico affiliated bottler systems 

pepsico and cocacola are the two largest customers of the beverage concentrates segment and constituted approximately 30 and 21  respectively of the segments net sales during 2010  in 2010 pepsico acquired the pepsi bottling group inc pbg and pepsiamericas inc pas and cocacola acquired cocacola enterprises’ cce north american bottling business the percentages above reflect the net sales of the combined entities during 2010 

packaged beverages 

our packaged beverages segment is principally a brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business in this segment we primarily manufacture and distribute packaged beverages and other products including our brands third party owned brands and certain private label beverages in the united states and canada in 2010  our packaged beverages segment had net sales of approximately 41 billion  key ncb brands in this segment include hawiian punch snapple mott’s yoohoo clamato deja blue arizona fiji mistic nantucket nectars realemon mr and mrs t rose’s and country time key csd brands in this segment include 7up dr pepper aw sunkist soda canada dry rc cola big red squirt vernors welch’s ibc and schweppes   

approximately 87 of our 2010 packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as fiji mineral water and arizona tea a portion of our sales also comes from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others for a fee although the majority of our packaged beverages’ net sales relate to our brands we also provide a routetomarket for third party brand owners seeking effective distribution for their new and emerging brands these brands give us exposure in certain markets to fast growing segments of the beverage industry with minimal capital investment   

our packaged beverages’ products are manufactured in multiple facilities across the us and are sold or distributed to retailers and their warehouses by our own distribution network or by third party distributors the raw materials used to manufacture our products include aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juices water and other ingredients 

we sell our packaged beverages’ products both through our direct store delivery system “dsd” supported by a fleet of more than 5000 trucks and approximately 12000 employees including sales representatives merchandisers drivers and warehouse workers as well as through our warehouse direct delivery system “wd” both of which include the sales to all major retail channels including supermarkets fountain channel mass merchandisers club stores vending machines convenience stores gas stations small groceries drug chains and dollar stores 

in 2010  walmart stores inc the largest customer of our packaged beverages segment accounted for approximately 18 of our net sales in this segment   

latin america beverages 

our latin america beverages segment is a brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business this segment participates mainly in the carbonated mineral water flavored csd bottled water and vegetable juice categories with particular strength in carbonated mineral water and grapefruit flavored csds in 2010  our latin america beverages segment had net sales of 382 million with our operations in mexico representing approximately 81 of the net sales of this segment key brands include peñafiel squirt clamato and aguafiel 

in mexico we manufacture and distribute our products through our bottling operations and third party bottlers and distributors in the caribbean we distribute our products through third party bottlers and distributors in mexico we also participate in a joint venture to manufacture aguafiel brand water with acqua minerale san benedetto we provide expertise in the mexican beverage market and acqua minerale san benedetto provides expertise in water production and new packaging technologies 

we sell our finished beverages through all major mexican retail channels including the “mom and pop” stores supermarkets hypermarkets and on premise channels 

volume 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 “concentrates case sales” and 2 “bottler case sales” the unit of measurement for both concentrates case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage or 24 twelve ounce servings 

concentrates case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrates case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates cases sold 

although our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates case sales we believe that bottler case sales as defined below are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales both by us and our bottlers of our finished beverages into retail channels 

packaged beverages sales volume 

in our packaged beverages segment we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our ownedbrands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

volume in bottler case sales 

in addition to sales volume we also measure volume in bottler case sales “volume bcs” as sales of packaged beverages in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases sold by us and our bottlers to retailers and independent distributors 

bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

consolidated operations 

  the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operation for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 dollars in millions 

  

  volume bcs 

volume bcs increased approximately 2 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the year ended december 31 2009  csds increased 2 and ncbs increased 3  in csds crush increased 18 compared with the year ago period due to expanded distribution the launch of cherry crush during the first quarter of 2010 and the limited time offering of the lime extension dr pepper volume increased 3 compared with the year ago period which resulted from increases in our regular and diet extensions partially offset by decreases in dr pepper cherry and cherry vanilla our core 4 brands were down 1 compared to the year ago period as a high singledigit decline in sunkist soda a mid singledigit decline in 7up and a low singledigit decline in aw were partially offset by a doubledigit increase in canada dry peñafiel volume decreased 8 due to decreased sales to third party distributors squirt volume increased 5  in ncbs 10 growth in snapple was due to the successful restage of the brand the growth of value offerings and increased marketing a 3 increase in mott’s was the result of new distribution and strong brand support additionally a 6 increase in hawaiian punch was partially offset by declines in third party ncb brands such as arizona 

although volume bcs increased 2 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the year ended december 31 2009 sales volume was flat for the same period the sales volume decreased as a result of a decline in contract manufacturing which is not included in volume bcs and lower concentrate sales as thirdparty bottlers purchased higher levels of concentrate during the fourth quarter of 2009 

  

in both the us and canada and in mexico and the caribbean volume increased 2 compared with the year ago period 

net sales 

  net sales increase d 105 million  or 2  for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the increase was primarily attributable to volume increases in ncbs the favorable impact of foreign currency concentrate price increases and 37 million in revenue recognized under the pepsico and cocacola licenses these increases were partially offset by a 53 million decline in contract manufacturing decreases in pricemix primarily attributable to csds and an unfavorable product mix 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 96 million  or 3  for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the year ended december 31 2009  gross margin of approximately 60 for the year ended december 31 2010  was higher than the approximately 59 gross margin for the year ended december 31 2009  primarily due to the favorable product mix as a result of the decline in contract manufacturing and ongoing supply chain efficiencies partially offset by 19 million of higher expenses associated with labor copacking unfavorable yield and an underabsorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of the strike at our williamson new york manufacturing facility as we continued to produce product and service customers during this work stoppage which ended on september 13 2010 and higher commodity costs 

income from operations 

income from operations decrease d 60 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the year ended december 31 2009 included onetime gains of 62 million primarily related to the termination of certain distribution agreements 

our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2010 and 2009  did not result in an impairment charge for 2010 and 2009  

there were no restructuring costs for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increase d 98 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the year ended december 31 2009  significant drivers of the increase were primarily due to higher marketing spend related to targeted marketing changes in foreign currency unfavorable comparison of the changes in fair value of commodity derivatives used in the distribution process higher benefit costs the onetime transaction costs associated with pepsico and cocacola agreements increased stockbased compensation costs an unfavorable comparison of the actuarial adjustments for certain insurance plans and higher productivity office investments these increases were partially offset by lower compensation costs and a onetime curtailment gain on certain us postretirement medical plans 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

in december 2010 the company completed a tender offer on a portion of the 2018 notes and retired at a premium an aggregate principal amount of approximately 476 million the loss on early extinguishment of debt included the 96 million premium for the tender offer a 3 million writeoff of a portion of the debt issuance costs and unamortized discount associated with the 2018 notes and 1 million of associated reacquisition costs 

interest expense and other income 

interest expense decrease d 115 million compared with the year ago period reflecting the repayment of our term loan a during december 2009 and our revolver in february 2010 combined with lower interest rates on our outstanding debt obligations during 2010 

other income of 21 million and 22 million in 2010 and 2009  respectively is primarily comprised of indemnity income associated with the tax sharing and indemnification agreement “tax indemnity agreement” with kraft for the year ended december 31 2010 indemnity income of 19 million included 10 million of benefits not expect to recur driven by our separation related tax losses and the impact of a canadian audit in 2010 for the year ended december 31 2009 other income included 6 million related to indemnity income associated with the tax indemnity agreement and an additional 16 million of onetime separation related items resulting from an audit settlement during the third quarter of 2009 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 358 and 363 respectively the most significant factor affecting this comparison of the effective tax rate between the periods was a favorable change of mexican law which allowed dps to release in 2010 14 million of tax accrued in 2009 when the law was enacted the decrease associated with the change of mexican law was partially offset by increased state tax rates which increased our deferred tax liabilities adjustments made to deferred tax including the adjustment to deferred tax related to a canadian change of law recognized and disclosed in the quarter ended march 31 2010 were not a significant driver for the reduction in the effective tax rate from 2009

net sales increased 93 million  or approximately 9  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the increase was primarily due to concentrate price increases 37 million in revenue recognized under the pepsico and cocacola licenses as well as a favorable impact of foreign currency concentrate price increases which were effective in january 2010  added an incremental 41 million to net sales during the year ended december 31 2010  these increases were partially offset by the loss of concentrate sales which resulted from the repatriation of brands associated with the pepsico transaction and transfer of concentrate sales in the caribbean to our latin america beverages segment 

  sop increased 62 million  or approximately 9  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  primarily driven by the increase in net sales and lower compensation costs the increase in net sales was partially offset by an increase in marketing spend primarily related to targeted marketing programs for dr pepper sunkist soda and canada dry 

volume bcs increased 1 for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  primarily driven by a 3 increase in dr pepper primarily led by diet and regular dr pepper crush increased 18  primarily driven by expanded distribution the launch of cherry crush in the first quarter of 2010 and the limited time offering of the lime extension these increases were partially offset by a doubledigit decline in hawaiian punch squirt and vernors as well as a 4 decrease in our core 4 brands the decrease in our core 4 brands was primarily driven by a doubledigit decline in 7up and sunkist soda which was partially offset by a high singledigit increase in canada dry the decreases in 7up sunkist soda hawaiian punch squirt and vernors were primarily driven by the repatriation of the brands to our packaged beverages segment and transfer of concentrate sales in the caribbean to our latin america beverages segment 

  

packaged beverages

sales volumes decreased 1 for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the majority of the decrease was the result of a decline in contract manufacturing which negatively impacted total volume by approximately 3  the decline in contract manufacturing was partially offset by volume growth in our ncb category repatriation of brands associated with the pepsico transaction increased total volume by 1  

  

total csd volume was flat for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  volume from the repatriation of the vernors and squirt brands associated with the pepsico transaction increased our csd volume 1  volume for our core 4 brands decreased 1  due to a mid singledigit decline and low singledigit decline s in 7up aw and sunkist soda respectively these decreases were partially offset by a doubledigit increase in canada dry due to targeted marketing programs dr pepper volumes declined 1  

  

total ncb volume increased 6 as a result of a 12 increase in snapple due to the successful restage of the brand growth of value offerings and increased marketing hawaiian punch and mott’s increased 11 and 3  respectively as a result of increased promotional activity and distribution gains 

net sales decreased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  primarily as a result of the 53 million decline in contract manufacturing additionally net sales were favorably impacted by volume increases in ncbs and changes in foreign currency partially offset by the unfavorable impact of product mix and decreases in pricemix primarily attributable to csds   

sop decreased 37 million for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with the year ended december 31 2009  the decrease was driven primarily by 19 million of higher expenses associated with labor copacking unfavorable yield and an underabsorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of our strike at our williamson new york manufacturing facility as we continued to produce product and service customers during this work stoppage which ended on september 13 2010 other factors negatively affecting this comparison include decreases in pricemix primarily attributable to csds costs and depreciation associated with the startup of our manufacturing facility in victorville california higher transportation costs higher benefit costs higher commodity costs an unfavorable comparison of the actuarial adjustments for certain insurance plans and a 5 million unfavorable noncash adjustment to rent expense for certain leases these items were partially offset by volume growth in our ncb category ongoing supply chain efficiencies and changes in foreign currency

kraft acquired cadbury on february 2 2010 and therefore assumes responsibility for cadbury’s indemnity obligations under the terms of the tax indemnity agreement

volume bcs increased 3 for the year ended december 31 2009  compared with the year ended december 31 2008  csds increased 4 and ncbs increased 2 the absence of hansen sales following the contract termination settlement in the united states and mexico negatively impacted both total volumes and csd volumes by 1 for the year ended december 31 2009  in csds dr pepper increased 2 led by the launch of the cherry line extensions and strength in diet dr pepper our core 4 brands remained flat while squirt decreased 8 driven by expanded distribution the crush brand grew 198 which added an additional 48 million cases in 2009 in beverage concentrates and latin america beverages in ncbs 14 growth in hawaiian punch and 8 growth in mott’s were partially offset by declines of 11 in snapple and 1 in both aguafiel and clamato aguafiel declined 1 reflecting price increases and a more competitive environment snapple volumes declined primarily due to higher net pricing associated with the snapple premium product restage and the impact of a continued slowdown in consumer spending on premium beverage products in 2009  we extended and repositioned our snapple offerings to support the long term health of the brand 

in north america volume increased 3 and in mexico and the caribbean volume increased 2 

net sales 

net sales decreased 179 million or 3 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008  the impact of the contract termination settlement with hansen reduced net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 by 218 million additionally the impact of foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 77 million these decreases were partially offset by price increases and an increase in volumes primarily driven by the expanded distribution of crush 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 177 million or 6 for the year ended december 31 2009  compared with the year ended december 31 2008  the increase is a result of several factors including a decrease in commodity costs the impact of price increases and volume increases and the positive impact of the lifo adjustment partially offset by the impact of the hansen termination and foreign currency gross profit for the year ended december 31 2009  includes a lifo benefit of 10 million compared to a lifo expense of 20 million for the year ended december 31 2008  lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent goods manufactured are sold first which in periods of rising prices results in an expense that eliminates inflationary profits from net income gross margin was 59 and 55 for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008  respectively 

income loss from operations 

the 1253 million increase in income from operations for the year ended december 31 2009  compared with the year ended december 31 2008 was primarily driven by the absence of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in 2009  an increase in gross profit a reduction in restructuring costs and onetime gains of 62 million primarily related to the termination of distribution agreements in october 2008 hansen notified us that it was terminating our agreements to distribute monster energy as well as other hansen’s branded beverages in the us effective november 10 2008 in december 2008 hansen notified us that it was terminating the agreement to distribute monster energy drinks in mexico effective january 26 2009 

our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2009  resulted in no impairment charges for 2009  compared to noncash impairment charges of 1039 million for 2008  

the pretax impairment charges in 2008 consisted of 278 million related to the snapple brand 581 million of distribution rights and 180 million of goodwill related to the dsd reporting unit deteriorating economic market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 triggered higher discount rates as well as lower volume and growth projections which drove these impairments indicative of the economic and market conditions our average stock price declined 19 in the fourth quarter as compared to the average stock price from may 7 2008 the date of our separation from cadbury through september 30 2008 the impairment of the distribution rights was attributed to insufficient net economic returns above working capital fixed assets and assembled workforce 

there were no restructuring costs for the year ended december 31 2009  restructuring costs of 57 million for the year ended december 31 2008 were primarily due to a plan announced in october 2007 intended to create a more efficient organization that resulted in the reduction of employees in the companys corporate sales and supply chain functions and the continued integration of dsd into our packaged beverages segment 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased for 2009 primarily due to an increase in compensationrelated costs and an increase in advertising and marketing of 53 million partially offset by decreased transportation and warehousing costs of 69 million driven by supply chain network optimization efforts in addition to a decrease in fuel costs and carrier rates in connection with our separation from cadbury we incurred transaction costs and other one time costs of 33 million for the year ended december 31 2008  

interest expense interest income and other income 

interest expense decreased 14 million compared with the year ago period interest expense for the year ended december 31 2009  reflects our capital structure as a standalone company and principally relates to our term loan a facility and senior unsecured notes as the term loan a was fully repaid prior to its maturity in december 2009  the company recorded a 30 million expense from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and 7 million expense from the dedesignation of a cash flow hedge associated with the term loan a in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2008  we incurred 26 million related to our bridge loan facility including 21 million of financing fees expensed when the bridge loan facility was terminated on april 30 2008 and additional interest expense on debt balances with subsidiaries of cadbury prior to our separation 

the 28 million decrease in interest income was primarily due to the loss of interest income earned on note receivable balances with subsidiaries of cadbury prior to our separation 

other income of 22 million in 2009 includes 6 million related to indemnity income associated with the tax indemnity agreement with cadbury and an additional 16 million of onetime separation related items resulting from an audit settlement during the third quarter of 2009  

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were 363 and 163 respectively the 2009 tax rate is higher than 2008 primarily because the 2008 tax rate reflects that the tax benefit provided on the 2008 impairment charge is at an effective rate lower than our statutory rate primarily due to limits on the tax benefit provided against goodwill however the 2009 tax rate also includes a reduced level of nonrecurring separation related costs benefits due to tax planning and decreased state tax rates which reduced our deferred tax liabilities these benefits were partly offset by additional tax expense related to a change in mexican tax law enacted in the fourth quarter 

results of operations by segment 

we report our business in three segments beverage concentrates packaged beverages and latin america beverages the key financial measures management uses to assess the performance of our segments are net sales and sop the following tables set forth net sales and sop for our segments for 2009 and 2008  as well as the adjustments necessary to reconcile our total segment results to our consolidated results presented in accordance with us gaap in millions 

  



  



beverage concentrates

net sales for the year ended december 31 2009  increased 80 million compared with year ended december 31 2008  due to a 6 increase in volumes as well as concentrate price increases the expanded distribution of crush added an incremental 74 million to net sales for the year ended december 31 2009  the increase in net sales was partially offset by higher fountain food service discounts and coupon spending 

  sop increased 61 million for the year ended december 31 2009  as compared with the year the ended december 31 2008  primarily driven by the increase in net sales and favorable manufacturing and distribution costs partially offset by increased marketing investments and higher personnel costs 

volume bcs increased 5 for the year ended december 31 2009  compared with the year ended december 31 2008  primarily driven by the expanded distribution of crush which added an incremental 44 million cases in 2009  dr pepper increased 2 led by the launch of the cherry line extensions and strength in diet dr pepper the volume of our core 4 brands declined 1 

  

packaged beverages 

the following table details our packaged beverages segments net sales and sop for 2009 and 2008 in millions 

  

sales volumes increased less than 1 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 the absence of sales of hansen’s products following the termination of that distribution agreement during the fourth quarter of 2008 negatively impacted total volumes by approximately 1 total csd volumes increased 1 led by increases in dr pepper whose volumes increased high single digits led by the launch of the cherry line extensions volumes for our core 4 brands increased low single digits total ncb volumes increased 1 due to a shift to value products such as hawaiian punch which increased low double digits partially offset by volume declines in the other ncb brands 

  

net sales decreased 194 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 hansen’s termination reduced net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 by 200 million additionally net sales were favorably impacted by volume and pricemix increases primarily in csds offset by unfavorable impact of product mix 

  

sop increased 90 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 the increase was driven primarily due to lower commodity costs including packaging materials and sweeteners and lower transportation and warehouse costs driven by supply chain network optimization efforts in addition to a decrease in fuel costs and carrier rates these increases in sop were partially offset by increased advertising and marketing costs and costs associated with information technology “it” infrastructure upgrades the hansen’s termination reduced sop by approximately 40 million 

latin america beverages 

the following table details our latin america beverages segment’s net sales and sop for 2009 and 2008 in millions 

  



sales volumes increased 2 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in volumes was driven by additional distribution routes gains in crush with the introduction of new flavors in a 23 liter value offering which added an incremental 4 million cases in 2009 and gains in peñafiel which benefited from a new marketing campaign partially offset by declines in squirt 

  

net sales decreased 65 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency the termination of hansen’s distribution agreement early in the first quarter of 2009 and an unfavorable impact related to product mix partially offset by increases in sales volumes the termination of the hansen agreement reduced net sales by approximately 18 million 

  

sop decreased 32 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the devaluation of the mexican peso hansen’s termination which had a net impact of 5 million a shift to value products and an increase in costs associated with distribution route expansion partially offset by increased sales volume 

accounting for the separation from cadbury 

upon separation effective may 7 2008 we became an independent company which established a new consolidated reporting structure for the periods prior to may 7 2008 our consolidated financial information has been prepared on a “carveout” basis from cadbury’s consolidated financial statements using the historical results of operations assets and liabilities attributable to cadbury’s americas beverages business and including allocations of expenses from cadbury the results may not be indicative of our future performance and may not reflect our financial performance had we been an independent publiclytraded company during those prior periods 

  items impacting the consolidated stat ements of operations 

  

the following transactions related to our separation from cadbury were included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in millions 

  



 

1 dps incurred transaction costs and other one time separation costs of 33 million for the year ended december 31 2008 these costs are included in sga expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

2 the company incurred 24 million of costs for the year ended december 31 2008 associated with the 17 billion bridge loan facility which was entered into to reduce financing risks and facilitate cadbury’s separation of the company financing fees of 21 million which were expensed when the bridge loan facility was terminated on april 30 2008 and 5 million of interest expense were included as a component of interest expense partially offset by 2 million in interest income while in escrow 

items impacting income taxes 

the consolidated financial statements present the taxes of our stand alone business and contain certain taxes transferred to us at separation in accordance with the tax indemnity agreement this agreement provides for the transfer to us of taxes related to an entity that was part of cadbury’s confectionery business and therefore not part of our historical consolidated financial statements the consolidated financial statements also reflect that the tax indemnity agreement requires cadbury to indemnify us for these taxes these taxes and the associated indemnity may change over time as estimates of the amounts change changes in estimates will be reflected when facts change and those changes in estimate will be reflected in our consolidated statements of operations at the time of the estimate change in addition pursuant to the terms of the tax indemnity agreement if we breach certain covenants or other obligations or we are involved in certain changeincontrol transactions cadbury may not be required to indemnify us for any of these unrecognized tax benefits that are subsequently realized 

kraft acquired cadbury on february 2 2010 and therefore assumes responsibility for cadbury’s indemnity obligations under the terms of the tax indemnity agreement

liquidity and capital resources 

  trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity 

customer and consumer demand for the companys products may be impacted by recession or other economic downturn in the united states canada mexico or the caribbean which could result in a reduction in our sales volume similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact the companys ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or our vendors to timely supply materials 

the company could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedge arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect the companys pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

we believe that the following recent transactions and trends and uncertainties may impact liquidity

net cash used in provided by investing activities

the decrease of 1325 million in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2009  compared with the year ended december 31 2008  was primarily attributable to related party notes receivable due to the separation from cadbury during 2008  for 2008  cash provided by net repayments of related party notes receivable of 1375 million for 2008  we increased capital expenditures by 13 million in the current year primarily due to the build out of the new manufacturing and distribution center in victorville california capital asset investments for both years primarily consisted of expansion of our capabilities in existing facilities replacement of existing cold drink equipment it investments for new systems and upgrades to the vehicle fleet additionally cash used in investing activities for 2009 included 68 million in proceeds primarily from the termination of hansen’s distributor agreement

prior to separation our cash was available for use and was regularly swept by cadbury operations in the united states at its discretion cadbury also funded our operating and investing activities as needed we earned interest income on certain related party balances our interest income has been reduced due to the settlement of the related party balances upon separation and accordingly we expect interest income for 2011 to be minimal

on october 4 2010 the company received a onetime nonrefundable cash payment of 715 million  completed the licensing of certain brands to cocacola following cocacolas acquisition of cces north american bottling business and executed separate agreements pursuant to which cocacola will offer dr pepper and diet dr pepper in local fountain accounts and the freestyle fountain program 

under the new licensing agreements cocacola began distributing dr pepper in the us and canada dry in the northeast us where these brands were previously being distributed by cce the same applies to canada dry and c plus in canada as part of the us licensing agreement cocacola has agreed to offer dr pepper and diet dr pepper in its local fountain accounts the new agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20 year renewal periods and will require cocacola to meet certain performance conditions

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary actual amounts may differ from these estimates and judgments we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting estimates see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred 1 delivery 2 persuasive evidence of an agreement exists 3 pricing is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the customer and us the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on contract terms for sales to customers that are designated in the contract as freeonboard destination revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to and accepted at the customer’s delivery site net sales are reported net of costs associated with customer marketing programs and incentives as described below as well as sales taxes and other similar taxes 

multiple deliverables were included in the arrangements entered into with pepsico and cocacola during 2010 in this case we first determined whether each deliverable met the separation criteria under us gaap the primary requirement for a deliverable to meet the separation criteria is if the deliverable has standalone value to the customer each deliverable that meets the separation criteria is considered a separate unit of accounting as the sale of the manufacturing and distribution rights and the ongoing sales of concentrate would not have standalone value to the customer both deliverables represent a single element of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition the onetime nonrefundable cash receipts from pepsico and cocacola were therefore recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25 year life of the customer relationship 

customer marketing programs and incentives 

the company offers a variety of incentives and discounts to bottlers customers and consumers through various programs to support the distribution of its products these incentives and discounts include cash discounts price allowances volume based rebates product placement fees and other financial support for items such as trade promotions displays new products consumer incentives and advertising assistance these incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales the aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately 3686 million  3419 million and 3057 million for the years ended december 31 2010  2009 and 2008  respectively during 2009 the company upgraded its sap platform in dsd as part of the upgrade dps harmonized its gross list price structure across locations the impact of the change increased gross sales and related discounts by equal amounts on customer invoices net sales were not affected the amounts of trade spend are larger in our packaged beverages segment than those related to other parts of our business accruals are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms volumebased metrics andor historical trends and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels 

goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 

in accordance with us gaap we classify intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill the majority of our intangible asset balance is made up of brands which we have determined to have indefinite useful lives in arriving at the conclusion that a brand has an indefinite useful life management reviews factors such as size diversification and market share of each brand management expects to acquire hold and support brands for an indefinite period through consumer marketing and promotional support we also consider factors such as our ability to continue to protect the legal rights that arise from these brand names indefinitely or the absence of any regulatory economic or competitive factors that could truncate the life of the brand name if the criteria are not met to assign an indefinite life the brand is amortized over its expected useful life 

we conduct tests for impairment in accordance with us gaap for intangible assets with definite lives we conduct tests for impairment if conditions indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives we conduct tests for impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination and also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units we define reporting units as beverage concentrates latin america beverages and packaged beverages’ two reporting units dsd and wd 

the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is recorded the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges “step 1” if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is indicated and a second step “step 2” analysis must be performed 

the tests for impairment include significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets primarily by analyzing forecasts of future revenues and profit performance fair value is based on what the intangible asset would be worth to a third party market participant discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt adjusted with various risk premiums these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various of the risks discussed in “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

for our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2010 and 2009  methodologies used to determine the fair values of the assets included an income based approach as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and our enterprise value management’s estimates of fair value which fall under level 3 are based on historical and projected operating performance discount rates were based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt and were adjusted with various risk premiums 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009  the results of the step 1 analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values and therefore are not impaired 

the results of the step 1 analyses performed as of december 31 2008 indicated there was a potential impairment of goodwill in the dsd reporting unit as the book value exceeded the estimated fair value as a result step 2 of the goodwill impairment test was performed for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill determined in the step 2 analysis was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the applicable reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and related deferred taxes as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as a result of the step 2 analysis we impaired the entire dsd reporting unit’s goodwill 

the step 2 analysis in 2008 resulted in noncash charges of 1039 million which are reported in the line item impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in our consolidated statements of operations a summary of the impairment charges for 2008 is provided below in millions 



 

 47 

the following table summarizes the critical assumptions that were used in estimating fair value for our annual impairment tests performed as of december 31 2008 



 

 for the dsd reporting unit’s goodwill keeping the residual operating income growth rate constant but changing the discount rate downward by 050 would indicate less of an impairment charge of approximately 60 million keeping the discount rate constant and increasing the residual operating income growth rate by 050 would indicate less of an impairment charge of approximately 10 million an increase of 050 in the estimated operating income growth rate would reduce the goodwill impairment charge by approximately 75 million 

for the snapple brand keeping the residual operating income growth rate constant but changing the discount rate by 050 would result in a 45 million to 50 million change in the impairment charge keeping the discount rate constant but changing the residual operating income growth rate by 050 would result in a 30 million to 35 million change in the impairment charge of the snapple brand a change of 025 in the estimated operating income growth rate would change the impairment charge by approximately 25 million 

a change in the critical assumptions detailed above would not result in a change to the impairment charge related to distribution rights 

the results of our annual impairment tests indicated that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill not discussed above exceeded their carrying values and therefore were not impaired 

based on triggering events in the second and third quarters of 2008 we performed interim impairment analyses of the snapple brand and the dsd reporting unit’s goodwill and concluded there was no impairment as of june 30 and september 30 2008 respectively however deteriorating economic and market conditions in the fourth quarter triggered higher discount rates as well as lower volume and growth projections which drove the impairments of the dsd reporting unit’s goodwill snapple brand and the dsd reporting unit’s distribution rights recorded in the fourth quarter indicative of the economic and market conditions our average stock price declined 19 in the fourth quarter as compared to the average stock price from may 7 2008 the date of our separation from cadbury through september 30 2008 the impairment of the distribution rights was attributed to insufficient net economic returns above working capital fixed assets and assembled workforce 

definite lived intangible assets 

definite lived intangible assets are those assets deemed by the management to have determinable finite useful lives identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives as follows 



stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased compensation plans under us gaap which requires the recognition of compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value of employee sharebased awards determining the amount of expense for stockbased compensation as well as the associated impact to our balance sheets and statements of cash flows requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stockbased compensation expense the most significant factors of that expense that require estimates or projections include the expected volatility expected lives and estimated forfeiture rates of stockbased awards as we lack a meaningful set of historical data upon which to develop valuation assumptions we have elected to develop certain valuation assumptions based on information disclosed by similarlysituated companies including multinational consumer goods companies of similar market capitalization and large food and beverage industry companies which have experienced an initial public offering since june 2001 

in accordance with us gaap we recognize the cost of all unvested employee stock options on a straightline attribution basis over their respective vesting periods net of estimated forfeitures 

pension and postretirement benefits 

we have several pension and postretirement plans covering employees who satisfy age and length of service requirements there are five standalone noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and six standalone postretirement plans depending on the plan pension and postretirement benefits are based on a combination of factors which may include salary age and years of service 

pension expense has been determined in accordance with the principles of us gaap our policy is to fund pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions employee demographic data years of service compensation benefits and claims paid and employer contributions 

the expense related to the postretirement plans has been determined in accordance with us gaap we accrue the cost of these benefits during the years that employees render service to us in accordance with us gaap 

the calculation of pension and postretirement plan obligations and related expenses is dependent on several assumptions used to estimate the present value of the benefits earned while the employee is eligible to participate in the plans the key assumptions we use in determining the plan obligations and related expenses include 1 the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities 2 employee turnover retirement age and mortality and 3 the expected return on plan assets our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance due to the significant judgment required our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and postretirement obligations and expenses refer to note 15 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

the effect of a 1 increase or decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the pension benefit obligations for us plans would change the benefit obligation as of december 31 2010  by approximately 23 million and 26 million  respectively the effect of a 1 increase or decrease in the weightedaverage assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended december 31 2010  by approximately 1 million ea ch 

risk management programs 

we retain selected levels of property casualty workers’ compensation health and other business risks many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or selfinsured retentions accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty and health risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends these loss development factors are established in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries at december 31 2010 and 2009  we had accrued liabilities related to the retained risks of 80 million and 68 million  respectively including both current and longterm liabilities 

we believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our selfinsured liabilities however the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known the final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents medical cost inflation legislative actions uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under us gaap this method involves determining the temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and the corresponding amounts recognized for tax purposes and computing the taxrelated carryforwards at the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the resulting amounts are deferred tax assets or liabilities and the net changes represent the deferred tax expense or benefit for the year the total of taxes currently payable per the tax return and the deferred tax expense or benefit represents the income tax expense or benefit for the year for financial reporting purposes 

we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings our estimate of current and expected future earnings prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and current and future ownership changes 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009  undistributed earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in nonus subsidiaries totaled approximately 203 million a nd 115 million  respectively deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income as the company believes these earnings to be permanently reinvested it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on these undistributed foreign earnings 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to various factors including but not limited to total earnings and the mix of earnings by jurisdiction the timing of changes in tax laws and the amount of tax provided for uncertain tax positions 

we establish income tax reserves to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following 1 the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained 2 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but for a lesser amount or 3 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken our evaluation of whether or not a tax position is uncertain is based on the following 1 we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 2 the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position and 3 each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken we adjust these income tax reserves when our judgment changes as a result of new information any change will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including inflation movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in united states dollars however we do have some exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2010  the impact to net income of a 10 change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately 16 million 

interest rate risk 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variable rate debt 

we are subject to floating interest rate risk with respect to any borrowings including those we may borrow in the future under the senior unsecured credit facility as of december 31 2010  there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior unsecured credit facility 

interest rate fair value hedge 

we enter into interest rate swaps to convert fixedrate longterm debt to floatingrate debt these swaps are accounted for as either a fair value hedge or an economic hedge under us gaap the fair value hedges qualify for the shortcut method of recognition therefore no portion of these swaps is treated as ineffective 

in december 2009 we entered into interest rate swaps having an aggregate notional amount of 850 million and durations ranging from two to three years in order to convert fixedrate longterm debt to floating rate debt these swaps were entered into at the inception of the 2011 and 2012 notes and were originally accounted for as fair value hedges under us gaap 

effective march 10 2010 225 million notional of the interest rate swap linked to the 2012 notes was restructured to reflect a change in the variable interest rate to be paid by us this change triggered the dedesignation of the 225 million notional fair value hedge and the corresponding fair value hedging relationship was discontinued the 225 million notional restructured interest rate swap was subsequently accounted for as an economic hedge and the gain or loss on the instrument is recognized in earnings effective september 21 2010 this financial instrument was terminated 

as a result of this remaining interest rate swap we pay an average floating rate which fluctuates semiannually based on libor the average floating rate to be paid by us as of december 31 2010 was less than 1 the average fixed rate to be received by us as of december 31 2010 was 170 

in december 2010 the company entered into an interest rate swap having a notional amount of 100 million and maturing in may 2038 in order to effectively convert a portion of the 2038 notes from fixedrate debt to floatingrate debt and designated it as a fair value hedge 

as a result of this interest rate swap we pay an average floating rate which fluctuates quarterly based on libor the average floating rate to be paid by us as of december 31 2010 was 373 the average fixed rate to be received by us as of december 31 2010 was 745 

interest rate economic hedge 

in december 2010 with the pending issuance of the 2016 notes the company entered into a treasury lock agreement with a notional value of 200 million and a maturity date of january 2011 to economically hedge the exposure to the possible rise in the benchmark interest rate prior to a future issuance of senior unsecured notes 

commodity risks 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of aluminum corn for high fructose corn syrup natural gas for use in processing and packaging pet and fuel 

we utilize commodities forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2010 was a net asset of 10 million 

as of december 31 2010  the impact to net income of a 10 change in market prices of these commodities is estimated to be approximately 34 million

attractive positioning within a large and profitable market we hold the 1 position in the united states flavored csd beverage markets by volume according to beverage digest we are also a leader in canada and mexico beverage markets we believe that these markets are wellpositioned to benefit from emerging consumer trends such as the need for convenience and the demand for products with health and wellness benefits our portfolio of products is biased toward flavored csds which continue to gain market share versus cola csds but also focuses on emerging categories such as teas energy drinks and juices 

 

broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage as of december 31 2009 we had 19 manufacturing facilities and 176 distribution centers in the united states as well as four manufacturing facilities and 27 distribution centers in mexico these facilities use a variety of manufacturing processes we have strategically located manufacturing and distribution capabilities enabling us to better align our operations with our customers reduce transportation costs and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches in addition our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and geographically dispersed to ensure our products are available to meet consumer demand we actively manage transportation of our products using our own fleet of more than 5000 delivery trucks as well as third party logistics providers on a selected basis 

 

strong operating margins and stable cash flows the breadth of our brand portfolio has enabled us to generate strong operating margins which have delivered stable cash flows these cash flows enable us to consider a variety of alternatives such as investing in our business reducing our debt paying dividends to our stockholders and repurchasing shares of our common stock 

 

experienced executive management team our executive management team has over 200 years of collective experience in the food and beverage industry the team has broad experience in brand ownership manufacturing and distribution and enjoys strong relationships both within the industry and with major customers in addition our management team has diverse skills that support our operating strategies including driving organic growth through targeted and efficient marketing reducing operating costs enhancing distribution efficiencies aligning manufacturing and distribution interests and executing strategic acquisitions 

 

our strategy 

 

the key elements of our business strategy are to 

 

build and enhance leading brands we have a welldefined portfolio strategy to allocate our marketing and sales resources we use an ongoing process of market and consumer analysis to identify key brands that we believe have the greatest potential for profitable sales growth we intend to continue to invest most heavily in our key brands to drive profitable and sustainable growth by strengthening consumer awareness developing innovative products and brand extensions to take advantage of evolving consumer trends improving distribution and increasing promotional effectiveness 

 

focus on opportunities in high growth and high margin categories we are focused on driving growth in our business in selected profitable and emerging categories these categories include readytodrink teas energy drinks and other beverages we also intend to capitalize on opportunities in these categories through brand extensions new product launches and selective acquisitions of brands and distribution rights for example we believe we are wellpositioned to enter into new distribution agreements for emerging high 

growth third party brands in new categories that can use our manufacturing and distribution network we can provide these new brands with distribution capability and resources to grow and they provide us with exposure to growing segments of the market with relatively low risk and capital investment 

 

increase presence in high margin channels and packages we are focused on improving our product presence in high margin channels such as convenience stores vending machines and small independent retail outlets through increased selling activity and significant investments in coolers and other cold drink equipment we have embarked on an expanded placement program for our branded coolers and other cold drink equipment and intend to significantly increase the number of those types of equipment over the next few years which we believe will provide an attractive return on investment we also intend to increase demand for high margin products like singleserve packages for many of our key brands through increased promotional activity 

 

leverage our integrated business model we believe our integrated brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business model provides us opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses we intend to leverage our integrated business model to reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage and to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches for example we intend to concentrate more of our manufacturing in multiproduct regional manufacturing facilities including opening a new plant in southern california in 2010 and investing in expanded capabilities in several of our existing facilities within the next several years 

 

strengthen our routetomarket in the near term strengthening our routetomarket will ensure the ongoing health of our brands we are rolling out handheld technology and upgrading our information technology “it” infrastructure to improve route productivity and data integrity and standards with third party bottlers we continue to deliver programs that maintain priority for our brands in their systems 

 

improve operating efficiency the integration of acquisitions into our direct store delivery system “dsd” a component of our packaged beverages segment has created the opportunity to improve our manufacturing warehousing and distribution operations for example we have been able to create multiproduct manufacturing facilities such as our irving texas facility which provide a region with a wide variety of our products at reduced transportation and copacking costs in 2009 we established a productivity office to drive ongoing productivity initiatives

customers 

 

we primarily serve two groups of customers 1 bottlers and distributors and 2 retailers 

 

bottlers buy beverage concentrates from us and in turn they manufacture bottle sell and distribute finished beverages bottlers also manufacture and distribute syrup for the fountain foodservice channel in addition bottlers and distributors purchase finished beverages from us and sell them to retail and other customers we have strong relationships with bottlers affiliated with cocacola and pepsico primarily because of the strength and market position of our key dr pepper brand 

retailers also buy finished beverages directly from us our portfolio of strong brands operational scale and experience in the beverage industry has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with major retailers in the united states canada and mexico in 2009 our largest retailer was walmart stores inc representing approximately 13 of our net sales 

 

seasonality 

 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

 

competition 

 

the liquid refreshment beverage industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the liquid refreshment beverage market are cocacola and pepsico each representing more than 30 of the us liquid refreshment beverage market by volume according to beverage digest we also compete against other large companies including nestlé sa “nestle” and kraft foods inc “kraft” these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler we compete with bottlers such as cce pbgpas and a number of smaller bottlers and distributors we also compete with a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as the cott corporation “cott” smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we have lower exposure to some of the faster growing noncarbonated and the bottled water segments in the overall liquid refreshment beverage market and as a result although we have increased our market share in the overall united states csd market we have lost share in the overall united states liquid refreshment beverage market over the past several years in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

 

although these bottlers and distributors are our competitors many of these companies are also our customers as they purchase beverage concentrates from us 

 

intellectual property and trademarks 

 

our intellectual property we possess a variety of intellectual property rights that are important to our business we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets to safeguard our proprietary rights including our brands and ingredient and production formulas for our products 

 

our trademarks our trademark portfolio includes more than 2500 registrations and applications in the united states canada mexico and other countries brands we own through various subsidiaries in various jurisdictions include dr pepper 7up aw canada dry rc cola schweppes squirt crush peñafiel aguafiel snapple mott’s hawaiian punch clamato mistic nantucket nectars mr  mrs t realemon venom and deja blue we own trademark registrations for all of these brands in the united states and we own trademark registrations for some but not all of these brands in canada mexico and other countries we also own a number of smaller regional brands some of our other trademark registrations are in countries where we do not currently have any significant level of business in addition in many countries outside the united states canada and mexico our rights to many of our brands including our dr pepper trademark and formula were sold by cadbury beginning over a decade ago to third parties including in certain cases to competitors such as cocacola 

 

trademarks licensed from others we license various trademarks from third parties which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute throughout the united states andor canada and mexico for example we license from third parties the sunkist soda welch’s country time orangina stewart’s rose’s holland house and margaritaville trademarks although these licenses vary in length and other terms they generally are longterm cover the entire united states andor canada and mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor 

licensed distribution rights we have rights in certain territories to bottle andor distribute various brands we do not own such as arizona tea and fiji mineral water some of these arrangements are relatively shorter in term are limited in geographic scope and the licensor may be able to terminate the agreement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us 

 

intellectual property we license to others we license some of our intellectual property including trademarks to others for example we license the dr pepper trademark to certain companies for use in connection with food confectionery and other products we also license certain brands such as dr pepper and snapple to third parties for use in beverages in certain countries where we own the brand but do not otherwise operate our business 

 

marketing 

 

our marketing strategy is to grow our brands through continuously providing new solutions to meet consumers’ changing preferences and needs we identify these preferences and needs and develop innovative solutions to address the opportunities solutions include new and reformulated products improved packaging design pricing and enhanced availability we use advertising media sponsorships merchandising public relations and promotion to provide maximum impact for our brands and messages 

 

manufacturing 

 

as of december 31 2009 we operated 23 manufacturing facilities across the united states and mexico almost all of our csd beverage concentrates are manufactured at a single plant in st louis missouri all of our manufacturing facilities are either regional manufacturing facilities with the capacity and capabilities to manufacture many brands and packages facilities with particular capabilities that are dedicated to certain brands or products or smaller bottling plants with a more limited range of packaging capabilities we will open a new multiproduct manufacturing facility in southern california during 2010 

 

we employ approximately 5000 fulltime manufacturing employees in our facilities including seasonal workers we have a variety of production capabilities including hotfill coldfill and aseptic bottling processes and we manufacture beverages in a variety of packaging materials including aluminum glass and pet cans and bottles and a variety of package formats including singleserve and multiserve packages and “baginbox” fountain syrup packaging 

 

in 2009 89 of our manufactured volumes came from our brands and 11 from third party and privatelabel products we also use third party manufacturers to package our products for us on a limited basis 

 

we owned property plant and equipment net of accumulated depreciation totaling 1044 million and 935 million in the united states and 65 million and 55 million in international locations as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

warehousing and distribution 

 

as of december 31 2009 our distribution network consisted of 176 distribution centers in the united states and 27 distribution centers in mexico our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and are geographically dispersed to ensure product is available to meet consumer demand we actively manage transportation of our products using combination of our own fleet of more than 5000 delivery trucks as well as third party logistics providers 

 

raw materials 

 

the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially in addition we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses 

under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging manufacturing costs for our packaged beverages segment where we manufacture and bottle finished beverages are higher as a percentage of our net sales than our beverage concentrates segment as the packaged beverages segment requires the purchase of a much larger portion of the packaging and ingredients although we have contracts with a relatively small number of suppliers we have generally not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required amount of raw materials 

 

when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process through the use of futures contracts and supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development team is composed of scientists and engineers in the united states and mexico who are focused on developing high quality products which have broad consumer appeal can be sold at competitive prices and can be safely and consistently produced across a diverse manufacturing network our research and development team engages in activities relating to product development microbiology analytical chemistry process engineering sensory science nutrition knowledge management and regulatory compliance we have particular expertise in flavors and sweeteners research and development costs are expensed when incurred and amounted to 15 million and 17 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively research and development costs totaled 14 million for 2007 net of allocations to cadbury additionally we incurred packaging engineering costs of 7 million 4 million and 5 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations

in the united states we have approximately 16000 fulltime employees we have many union collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 4000 fulltime employees several agreements cover multiple locations these agreements often address working conditions as well as wage rates and benefits in mexico and the caribbean we employ approximately 3000 fulltime employees and are also party to collective bargaining agreements we do not have a significant number of employees in canada 

 

we believe we have good relations with our employees

in the normal course of our business we are subject to a variety of federal state and local environment health and safety laws and regulations we maintain environmental health and safety policies and a quality environmental health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations the cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations 

 

available information 

 

our web site address is wwwdrpeppersnapplegroupcom information on our web site is not incorporated by reference in this document we make available free of charge through this web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 

 

market and industry data 

 

the market and industry data in this annual report on form 10k is from independent industry sources including the nielsen company and beverage digest although we believe that these independent sources are reliable we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of this data or any assumptions underlying such data 

 

the nielsen company is a marketing information provider primarily serving consumer packaged goods manufacturers and retailers we use the nielsen company data as our primary management tool to track market performance because it has broad and deep data coverage is based on consumer transactions at retailers and is reported to us monthly the nielsen company data provides measurement and analysis of marketplace trends such as market share retail pricing promotional activity and distribution across various channels retailers and geographies measured categories provided to us by the nielsen company scantrack include flavored noncola csds energy drinks singleserve bottled water nonalcoholic mixers and ncbs including readytodrink teas singleserve and multiserve juice and juice drinks and sports drinks the nielsen company also provides data on other food items such as apple sauce the nielsen company data we present in this report is from the nielsen company’s scantrack service which compiles data based on scanner transactions in certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers drug chains convenience stores and gas stations however this data does not include the fountain or vending channels walmart or small independent retail outlets which together represent a meaningful portion of the united states liquid refreshment beverage market and of our net sales and volume 

 

beverage digest is an independent beverage research company that publishes an annual beverage digest fact book we use beverage digest primarily to track market share information and broad beverage and channel trends this annual publication provides a compilation of data supplied by beverage companies beverage digest covers the following categories csds energy drinks bottled water and ncbs including readytodrink teas juice and juice drinks and sports drinks beverage digest data does not include multiserve juice products or bottled water in packages of 15 liters or more data is reported for certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores drug chains convenience stores gas stations fountains vending machines and the “upanddownthestreet” channel consisting of small independent retail outlets 

we use both the nielsen company and beverage digest to assess both our own and our competitors’ performance and market share in the united states different market share rankings can result for a specific beverage category depending on whether data from the nielsen company or beverage digest is used in part because of the differences in the sales channels reported by each source for example because the fountain channel where we have a relatively small business except for dr pepper is not included in the nielsen company data our market share using the nielsen company data is generally higher for our csd portfolio than the beverage digest data which does include the fountain channel 

 

in this annual report on form 10k all information regarding the beverage market in the united states is from beverage digest and except as otherwise indicated is from 2008 all information regarding our brand market positions in the us is from the nielsen company and is based on retail dollar sales in 2009

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

risks related to our business 

 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties could harm our business and financial condition 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

 

the liquid refreshment beverage industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences competition is generally based upon brand recognition taste quality price availability selection and convenience we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources our two largest competitors in the liquid refreshment beverage market are cocacola and pepsico each representing more than 30 of the us liquid refreshment beverage market by volume according to beverage digest we also compete against other large companies including nestle and kraft these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products reducing prices or increasing promotional activities as a bottler we compete with bottlers such as cce pbg pas and a number of smaller bottlers and distributors we also compete with a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers such as cott smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets we have lower exposure to some of the faster growing noncarbonated and the bottled water segments in the overall liquid refreshment beverage market and as a result although we have increased our market share in the overall united states csd market we have lost share in the overall united states liquid refreshment beverage market over the past several years in canada mexico and the caribbean we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors 

 

although these bottlers and distributors are our competitors many of these companies are also our customers as they purchase beverage concentrates from us 

 

our inability to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales as a result we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors 

 

consumers’ preferences can change due to a variety of factors including aging of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness and demand for regular csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards low or no calorie soft drinks and increasingly to ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences then quickly develop new products in 

response our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

 

food and beverage retailers in the united states have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products’ retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

 

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a portion of our business 

 

net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies that we do not own the beverage concentrates segment’s net sales generate a portion of our overall net sales some of these bottlers are partly owned by a competitor in the case of pbg and pas pepsico has acquired majority ownership additionally cocacola is now in the process of acquiring ownership of cce’s north american bottling business the majority of these bottlers’ business comes from selling our competitors’ products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors’ products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession or other economic downturn in the united states canada mexico or the caribbean which could result in a reduction in our sales volume andor switching to lower price offerings similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or our vendors to timely supply materials 

 

we could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedge arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had 88 billion of total assets of which approximately 57 billion were intangible assets intangible assets include goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with brands bottler agreements distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of december 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess there was no impairment required based 

upon our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2009 for additional information about these intangible assets see “critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of intangible assets since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a noncash charge in our statement of operations which may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

as of december 31 2009 our total indebtedness was 2971 million total indebtedness is defined as longterm obligations of 2960 million plus the 8 million adjustment related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges and the 3 million of current obligations related to capital leases included as a component of accounts payable and accrued expenses subsequent to december 31 2009 the company made optional repayments of 405 million which represented the outstanding principal balance on the revolving credit facility the “revolver” as of december 31 2009 

 

this substantial amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including 

 

  

to the extent we experience deteriorating economic conditions the risks described above would increase additionally it may become more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures other corporate purposes and to grow our business could be reduced our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due 

 

in addition the credit agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things limit our ability to incur debt at subsidiaries that are not guarantors incur liens merge or sell transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into agreements restricting our ability to incur liens or the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions the credit agreement also requires us to comply with certain affirmative and financial covenants 

 

we may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations and they could change 

 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the united states canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see “regulatory matters” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing certain state warning and labeling laws such as california’s “prop 65” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects could become applicable to our products 

some local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in schools any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or disrupt the production or distribution of our products and negatively affect our business and financial performance in addition taxes imposed on the sale of certain of our products by federal state local and foreign governments could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing our products for example some members of the united states federal government have raised the possibility of a federal tax on the sale of certain “sugared” beverages including nondiet soft drinks fruit drinks teas and flavored waters to help pay for the cost of healthcare reform some united states state governments are also considering similar taxes if enacted such taxes could materially affect our business and financial results 

 

our distribution agreements with our allied brands could be terminated 

 

hansen natural corporation and glacéau terminated their distribution agreements with us in 2008 and 2007 respectively we are subject to a risk of other allied brands such as fiji and arizona terminating their distribution agreements with us which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we evaluate these claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we may establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims or proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance for more information see note 20 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

benefits cost increases could reduce our profitability 

 

our profitability is substantially affected by the costs of pension postretirement employee medical costs and other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial performance 

 

costs for our raw materials may increase substantially 

 

the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale also uses electricity and natural gas the cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially we are significantly impacted by increases in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and our use of third party carriers under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging continued price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can 

require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

 

we have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we expect to incur substantial costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

 

as of december 31 2009 approximately 4000 of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls and liability claims moreover negative publicity could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see “intellectual property and trademarks” in item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend 

ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the united states canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of the trademark and negatively impact our brands 

 

in some cases we license products from third parties which we distribute the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have “key person” life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees 

 

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various accounting order entry and other transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses hackers other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

weather and climate changes could adversely affect our business 

 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

 

there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns “global warming” changing weather patterns along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could negatively impact the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that we use to produce our products additionally the sale of our products can be negatively impacted by weather conditions 

 

concern over climate change including global warming has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries that we operate laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production distribution packaging cost of raw materials fuel ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results

even though we have recently declared two separate cash dividends our board of directors the “board” has not adopted a formal dividend policy under which we might pay regular periodic dividends to our stockholders nonetheless we expect to return our excess cash flow to our stockholders from time to time through our common stock repurchase program described below or the payment of dividends however there can be no assurance that share repurchases will occur or future dividends will be declared or paid the share repurchase programs and declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such share repurchases or dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates for dividends if any is subject to final determination by our board after its review of the then current strategy and financial performance and position among other things

business overview 

 

we are a leading integrated brand owner manufacturer and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the united states canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored carbonated soft drinks “csds” and noncarbonated beverages “ncbs” including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper sunkist soda 7up aw canada dry crush squirt peñafiel schweppes and venom energy and ncb brands such as snapple mott’s hawaiian punch clamato rose’s and mr  mrs t mixers our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the united states according to the nielsen company we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers 

 

we operate primarily in the united states mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2009 90 of our net sales were generated in the united states 4 in canada and 6 in mexico and the caribbean 

 

our business model 

 

we operate as a brand owner a manufacturer and a distributor 

 

our brand ownership businesses as a brand owner we build our brands by promoting brand awareness through marketing advertising and promotion and by developing new and innovative products and product line extensions that address consumer preferences and needs as the owner of the formulas and proprietary knowhow required for the preparation of beverages we manufacture sell and distribute beverage concentrates and syrups used primarily to produce csds and we manufacture sell and distribute primarily finished ncbs most of our sales of beverage concentrates are to bottlers who manufacture bottle sell and distribute our branded products into retail channels we also manufacture sell and distribute syrups for use in beverage fountain dispensers to restaurants and retailers as well as to fountain wholesalers who resell it to restaurants and retailers in addition we distribute finished ncbs through ourselves and through third party distributors 

 

our beverage concentrates and brand ownership businesses are characterized by relatively low capital investment raw materials and employee costs although the cost of building or acquiring an established brand can be significant established brands typically do not require significant ongoing expenditures other than marketing and therefore generate relatively high margins our packaged beverages brand ownership businesses have characteristics of both of our beverage concentrates and brand ownership businesses as well as our manufacturing and distribution businesses discussed below 

our manufacturing and distribution businesses we manufacture sell and distribute finished csds from concentrates and finished ncbs and products mostly from ingredients other than concentrates we sell and distribute packaged beverages and other products primarily into retail channels either directly to retail shelves or to warehouses through our large fleet of delivery trucks or through third party logistics providers 

 

our manufacturing and distribution businesses are characterized by relatively high capital investment raw material selling and distribution costs in each case compared to our beverage concentrates and brand ownership businesses our capital costs include investing in and maintaining our manufacturing and warehouse equipment and facilities our raw material costs include purchasing beverage concentrates ingredients and packaging materials from a variety of suppliers our selling and distribution costs include significant costs related to operating our large fleet of delivery trucks and employing a significant number of employees to sell and deliver finished beverages and other products to retailers as a result of the high fixed costs associated with these types of businesses we are focused on maintaining an adequate level of volumes as well as controlling capital expenditures raw material selling and distribution costs in addition geographic proximity to our customers is a critical component of managing the high cost of transporting finished beverages relative to their retail price the profitability of the manufacturing and distribution businesses is also dependent upon our ability to sell our products into higher margin channels as a result of these factors the margins of our manufacturing and distribution businesses are significantly lower than those of our brand ownership businesses in light of the largely fixed cost nature of the manufacturing and distribution businesses increases in costs for example raw materials tied to commodity prices could have a significant negative impact on the margins of our businesses 

 

approximately 87 of our 2009 packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as fiji mineral water and arizona tea in addition a small portion of our packaged beverages sales come from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others for a fee 

 

integrated business model we believe our brand ownership manufacturing and distribution are more integrated than the united states operations of our principal competitors and that this differentiation provides us with a competitive advantage we believe our integrated business model 

 

  

trends affecting our business 

 

we believe the key trends influencing the north american liquid refreshment beverage market include 

 

 24 

 

  

seasonality 

 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

 

segments 

 

we report our business in three operating segments beverage concentrates packaged beverages and latin america beverages 

 

the key financial measures management uses to assess the performance of our segments are net sales and segment operating profit loss “sop” 

 

beverage concentrates 

 

our beverage concentrates segment is principally a brand ownership business in this segment we manufacture and sell beverage concentrates in the united states and canada most of the brands in this segment are csd brands in 2009 our beverage concentrates segment had net sales of approximately 11 billion key brands include dr pepper 7up sunkist soda aw canada dry crush schweppes squirt rc cola diet rite sundrop welch’s vernors country time and the concentrate form of hawaiian punch 

 

we are the industry leader in flavored csds with a 403 market share in the united states for 2009 as measured by retail sales according to the nielsen company we are also the third largest csd brand owner as measured by 2009 retail sales in the united states and canada and we own a leading brand in most of the csd categories in which we compete 

 

almost all of our beverage concentrates are manufactured at our plant in st louis missouri 

 

the beverage concentrates are shipped to third party bottlers as well as to our own manufacturing systems who combine them with carbonation water sweeteners and other ingredients package it in pet containers glass bottles and aluminum cans and sell it as a finished beverage to retailers beverage concentrates are also manufactured into syrup which is shipped to fountain customers such as fast food restaurants who mix the syrup with water and carbonation to create a finished beverage at the point of sale to consumers dr pepper represents most of our fountain channel volume concentrate prices historically have been reviewed and adjusted at least on an annual basis 

our beverage concentrates brands are sold by our bottlers including our own packaged beverages segment through all major retail channels including supermarkets fountains mass merchandisers club stores vending machines convenience stores gas stations small groceries drug chains and dollar stores unlike the majority of our other csd brands 72 of dr pepper volumes are distributed through the cocacola affiliated and pepsico affiliated bottler systems 

 

pepsi bottling group inc “pbg” and cocacola enterprises inc “cce” are the two largest customers of the beverage concentrates segment and constituted approximately 25 and 23 respectively of net sales during 2009 

 

packaged beverages 

 

our packaged beverages segment is principally a brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business in this segment we primarily manufacture and distribute packaged beverages and other products including our brands third party owned brands and certain private label beverages in the united states and canada in 2009 our packaged beverages segment had net sales of approximately 41 billion key ncb brands in this segment include snapple mott’s hawaiian punch clamato yoohoo country time nantucket nectars realemon mr and mrs t rose’s and margaritaville key csd brands in this segment include dr pepper 7up sunkist soda aw canada dry squirt rc cola welch’s vernors ibc mistic and venom energy 

 

approximately 87 of our 2009 packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as fiji mineral water and arizona tea a portion of our sales also comes from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others for a fee although the majority of our packaged beverages’ net sales relate to our brands we also provide a routetomarket for third party brand owners seeking effective distribution for their new and emerging brands these brands give us exposure in certain markets to fast growing segments of the beverage industry with minimal capital investment 

 

our packaged beverages’ products are manufactured in multiple facilities across the united states and are sold or distributed to retailers and their warehouses by our own distribution network or by third party distributors the raw materials used to manufacture our products include aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juices water and other ingredients 

 

we sell our packaged beverages’ products both through our direct store delivery system “dsd” supported by a fleet of more than 5000 trucks and approximately 12000 employees including sales representatives merchandisers drivers and warehouse workers as well as through our warehouse direct delivery system “wd” both of which include the sales to all major retail channels including supermarkets fountain channel mass merchandisers club stores vending machines convenience stores gas stations small groceries drug chains and dollar stores 

 

in 2009 walmart stores inc the largest customer of our packaged beverages segment accounted for approximately 17 of our net sales in this segment 

 

latin america beverages 

 

our latin america beverages segment is a brand ownership manufacturing and distribution business this segment participates mainly in the carbonated mineral water flavored csd bottled water and vegetable juice categories with particular strength in carbonated mineral water and grapefruit flavored csds in 2009 our latin america beverages segment had net sales of 357 million with our operations in mexico representing approximately 88 of the net sales of this segment key brands include peñafiel squirt clamato and aguafiel 

 

in mexico we manufacture and distribute our products through our bottling operations and third party bottlers and distributors in the caribbean we distribute our products through third party bottlers and distributors in mexico we also participate in a joint venture to manufacture aguafiel brand water with acqua minerale san benedetto we provide expertise in the mexican beverage market and acqua minerale san benedetto provides expertise in water production and new packaging technologies 

we sell our finished beverages through all major mexican retail channels including the “mom and pop” stores supermarkets hypermarkets and on premise channels 

 

acquisitions 

 

on july 11 2007 we acquired southeastatlantic beverage corporation “seabev” seabev is included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on its date of acquisition 

 

volume 

 

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 

 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

 

in our beverage concentrates segment we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 “concentrates case sales” and 2 “bottler case sales” the unit of measurement for both concentrates case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage or 24 twelve ounce servings 

 

concentrates case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrates case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates cases sold 

 

although our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates case sales we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of our finished beverages into retail channels 

 

packaged beverages sales volume 

 

in our packaged beverages segment we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us case sales include both our ownedbrands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

 

volume in bottler case sales 

 

in addition to sales volume we also measure volume in bottler case sales “volume bcs” as sales of packaged beverages in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases sold by us and our bottlers to retailers and independent distributors 

 

bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

consolidated operations 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operation for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

volume 

 

volume bcs increased 3 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 csds increased 4 and ncbs increased 2 the absence of hansen sales following the contract termination settlement in the united states and mexico negatively impacted both total volumes and csd volumes by 1 for the year ended december 31 2009 in csds dr pepper increased 2 led by the launch of the cherry line extensions and strength in diet dr pepper 7up sunkist soda aw and canada dry collectively our “core 4 brands” remained flat while squirt decreased 8 driven by expanded distribution the crush brand grew 198 which added an additional 48 million cases in 2009 in beverage concentrates and latin america beverages in ncbs 14 growth in hawaiian punch and 8 growth in mott’s were partially offset by declines of 11 in snapple and 1 in both aguafiel and clamato aguafiel declined 1 reflecting price increases and a more competitive environment snapple volumes declined primarily due to higher net pricing associated with the snapple premium product restage and the impact of a continued slowdown in consumer spending on premium beverage products in 2009 we extended and repositioned our snapple offerings to support the long term health of the brand 

 

in north america volume increased 3 and in mexico and the caribbean volume increased 2 

 

net sales 

 

net sales decreased 179 million or 3 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 the impact of the contract termination settlement with hansen reduced net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 by 218 million additionally the impact of foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 77 million these decreases were partially offset by price increases and an increase in volumes primarily driven by the expanded distribution of crush

gross profit increased 177 million or 6 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 the increase is a result of several factors including a decrease in commodity costs the impact of price increases and volume increases and the positive impact of the lifo adjustment partially offset by the impact of the hansen termination and foreign currency gross profit for the year ended december 31 2009 includes a lifo benefit of 10 million compared to a lifo expense of 20 million for the year ended december 31 2008 lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent goods manufactured are sold first which in periods of rising prices results in an expense that eliminates inflationary profits from net income gross margin was 59 and 55 for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

income loss from operations 

 

the 1253 million increase in income from operations for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 was primarily driven by the absence of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in 2009 an increase in gross profit a reduction in restructuring costs and onetime gains of 62 million primarily related to the termination of distribution agreements in october 2008 hansen notified us that it was terminating our agreements to distribute monster energy as well as other hansen’s branded beverages in the us effective november 10 2008 in december 2008 hansen notified us that it was were terminating the agreement to distribute monster energy drinks in mexico effective january 26 2009 

 

our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2009 resulted in no impairment charges for 2009 compared to noncash impairment charges of 1039 million for 2008 

 

the pretax impairment charges in 2008 consisted of 278 million related to the snapple brand 581 million of distribution rights and 180 million of goodwill related to the dsd reporting unit deteriorating economic market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 triggered higher discount rates as well as lower volume and growth projections which drove these impairments indicative of the economic and market conditions our average stock price declined 19 in the fourth quarter as compared to the average stock price from may 7 2008 the date of our separation from cadbury through september 30 2008 the impairment of the distribution rights was attributed to insufficient net economic returns above working capital fixed assets and assembled workforce 

 

there were no restructuring costs for the year ended december 31 2009 restructuring costs of 57 million for the year ended december 31 2008 were primarily due to a plan announced in october 2007 intended to create a more efficient organization that resulted in the reduction of employees in the company’s corporate sales and supply chain functions and the continued integration of dsd into our packaged beverages segment 

 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased for 2009 primarily due to an increase in compensationrelated costs and an increase in advertising and marketing of 53 million partially offset by decreased transportation and warehousing costs of 69 million driven by supply chain network optimization efforts in addition to a decrease in fuel costs and carrier rates in connection with our separation from cadbury we incurred transaction costs and other one time costs of 33 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

interest expense interest income and other income 

 

interest expense decreased 14 million compared with the year ago period interest expense for the year ended december 31 2009 reflects our capital structure as a standalone company and principally relates to our term loan a facility and senior unsecured notes as the term loan a was fully repaid prior to its maturity in december 2009 the company recorded a 30 million expense from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and 7 million expense from the dedesignation of a cash flow hedge associated with the term loan a in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred 26 million related to our bridge loan facility including 21 million of financing fees expensed when the bridge loan facility was terminated on april 30 2008 and additional interest expense on debt balances with subsidiaries of cadbury prior to our separation 

 

the 28 million decrease in interest income was primarily due to the loss of interest income earned on note receivable balances with subsidiaries of cadbury prior to our separation 

other income of 22 million in 2009 includes 6 million related to indemnity income associated with the tax sharing and indemnification agreement “tax indemnity agreement” with cadbury and an additional 16 million of onetime separation related items resulting from an audit settlement during the third quarter of 2009 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were 363 and 163 respectively the 2009 tax rate is higher than 2008 primarily because the 2008 tax rate reflects that the tax benefit provided on the 2008 impairment charge is at an effective rate lower than our statutory rate primarily due to limits on the tax benefit provided against goodwill however the 2009 tax rate also includes a reduced level of nonrecurring separation related costs benefits due to tax planning and decreased state tax rates which reduced our deferred tax liabilities these benefits were partly offset by additional tax expense related to a change in mexican tax law enacted in the fourth quarter

sales volumes increased 2 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in volumes was driven by additional distribution routes gains in crush with the introduction of new flavors in a 23 liter value offering which added an incremental 4 million cases in 2009 and gains in peñafiel which benefited from a new marketing campaign partially offset by declines in squirt 

 

net sales decreased 65 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency the termination of hansen’s distribution agreement early in the first quarter of 2009 and an unfavorable impact related to product mix partially offset by increases in sales volumes the termination of the hansen agreement reduced net sales by approximately 18 million 

 

sop decreased 32 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the devaluation of the mexican peso hansen’s termination which had a net impact of 5 million a shift to value products and an increase in costs associated with distribution route expansion partially offset by increased sales volume 

 

accounting for the separation from cadbury 

 

upon separation effective may 7 2008 we became an independent company which established a new consolidated reporting structure for the periods prior to may 7 2008 our consolidated financial information has been prepared on a “carveout” basis from cadbury’s consolidated financial statements using the historical results of operations assets and liabilities attributable to cadbury’s americas beverages business and including allocations of expenses from cadbury the results may not be indicative of our future performance and may not reflect our financial performance had we been an independent publiclytraded company during those prior periods 

items impacting the consolidated statements of operations 

 

the following transactions related to our separation from cadbury were included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

items impacting income taxes 

 

the consolidated financial statements present the taxes of our stand alone business and contain certain taxes transferred to us at separation in accordance with the tax indemnity agreement between us and cadbury this agreement provides for the transfer to us of taxes related to an entity that was part of cadbury’s confectionery business and therefore not part of our historical consolidated financial statements the consolidated financial statements also reflect that the tax indemnity agreement requires cadbury to indemnify us for these taxes these taxes and the associated indemnity may change over time as estimates of the amounts change changes in estimates will be reflected when facts change and those changes in estimate will be reflected in our statement of operations at the time of the estimate change in addition pursuant to the terms of the tax indemnity agreement if we breach certain covenants or other obligations or we are involved in certain changeincontrol transactions cadbury may not be required to indemnify us for any of these unrecognized tax benefits that are subsequently realized 

 

kraft acquired cadbury on february 2 2010 and therefore assumes responsibility for cadbury’s indemnity obligations under the terms of the tax indemnity agreement

volume 

 

volume bcs declined 2 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared with the year ended december 31 2007 csds declined 1 and ncbs declined 7 the absence of glaceau brand “glaceau” sales following the termination of the distribution agreement in 2007 negatively impacted total volumes and ncb volumes by 1 and 7 respectively in csds dr pepper declined 1 primarily due to continued declines in the “soda fountain classics” line our core 4 brands declined 2 primarily related to a 7 decline in 7up as the brand cycled the final stages of launch support for 7up with 100 natural flavors and the relaunch of diet 7up partially offset by a 3 increase in canada dry due to the launch of canada dry green tea ginger ale in ncbs 9 growth in hawaiian punch 6 growth in clamato and 2 growth in mott’s were more than offset by declines of 17 in aguafiel 7 in snapple and the loss of glaceau distribution rights aguafiel declined 17 reflecting price increases and a more competitive environment our snapple volumes were down 7 as the brand overlapped 5 growth in the prior year driven by aggressive promotional activity that we chose not to repeat in 2008 as well as the impact of a weakened retail environment on our premium products in north america volume declined 2 and in mexico and the caribbean volume declined 4 

net sales 

 

net sales increased 15 million for 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to price increases and an increase in concentrate sales as bottlers purchased more concentrate in advance of planned concentrate price increases concentrate price increases were effective in january 2009 compared with concentrate price increases which were made in february 2008 these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales volumes and an increase in discounts paid to customers the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement on november 2 2007 and the hansen distribution agreement in the united states on november 10 2008 reduced 2008 net sales by 227 million and 23 million respectively net sales resulting from the acquisition of seabev in july 2007 added an incremental 61 million to 2008 consolidated net sales 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit remained flat for 2008 compared with the prior year increased pricing largely offset the decrease in sales volumes increased customer discounts and increased commodity costs across our segments gross profit for the year ended december 31 2008 includes lifo expense of 20 million compared to 6 million in 2007 lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent goods manufactured are sold first which in periods of rising prices results in an expense that eliminates inflationary profits from net income gross margin was 55 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

loss income from operations 

 

the 1172 million decrease in income from operations for 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily driven by impairment charges of 1039 million in 2008 a one time gain we recognized in 2007 of 71 million in connection with the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement and higher sga expenses in 2008 partially offset by lower restructuring costs 

 

our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2008 resulted in noncash impairment charges of 1039 million for 2008 the pretax charges consisted of 278 million related to the snapple brand 581 million of distribution rights and 180 million of goodwill related to the dsd reporting unit deteriorating economic and market conditions in the fourth quarter triggered higher discount rates as well as lower volume and growth projections which drove these impairments indicative of the economic and market conditions our average stock price declined 19 in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the average stock price from may 7 2008 the date of our separation from cadbury through september 30 2008 the impairment of the distribution rights was attributed to insufficient net economic returns above working capital fixed assets and assembled workforce 

 

sga expenses increased for 2008 primarily due to separation related costs higher transportation costs and increased payroll and payroll related costs in connection with our separation from cadbury we incurred transaction costs and other one time costs of 33 million for 2008 we incurred higher transportation costs principally due to an increase of 22 million related to higher fuel prices these increases were partially offset by benefits from restructuring initiatives announced in 2007 lower marketing costs and 12 million in lower stockbased compensation expense 

 

restructuring costs of 57 million and 76 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively were primarily due to a plan announced in october 2007 intended to create a more efficient organization that resulted in the reduction of employees in the company’s corporate sales and supply chain functions and the continued integration of dsd into other operations of the company restructuring costs for 2007 were higher due to higher costs associated with the organizational restructuring as well as additional costs recognized for the integration of technology facilities and the closure of a facility 

 

the loss of the glaceau distribution agreement reduced 2008 income from operations by 40 million excluding the one time gain from the payment we received on termination 

interest expense interest income and other income 

 

interest expense increased 4 million reflecting our capital structure as a standalone company principally relating to our term loan a and unsecured notes interest expense for 2008 contained 26 million related to our bridge loan facility including 21 million of financing fees expensed when the bridge loan facility was terminated in 2008 we incurred 160 million less interest expense related to debt owed to cadbury and 19 million related to third party debt settlement 

 

the 32 million decrease in interest income was primarily due to the loss of interest income earned on note receivable balances with subsidiaries of cadbury partially offset as we earned interest income on the funds from the bridge loan facility and other cash balances 

 

other income of 18 million in 2008 primarily related to indemnity income associated with the tax indemnity agreement with cadbury 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 163 and 394 respectively the 2008 tax rate reflects that the tax benefit provided on the 2008 impairment charge is at an effective rate lower than our statutory rate primarily due to limits on the tax benefit provided against goodwill the 2008 tax benefit also reflects expense of 19 million related to items for which cadbury is obligated to indemnify us for under the tax indemnity agreement as well as additional tax expense of 16 million driven by separation transactions

liquidity and capital resources 

 

trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity 

 

customer and consumer demand for the company’s products may be impacted by recession or other economic downturn in the united states canada mexico or the caribbean which could result in a reduction in our sales volume similarly disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact the company’s ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers suppliers and creditors these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us thus reducing our cash flow or our vendors to timely supply materials 

 

the company could also face increased counterparty risk for our cash investments and our hedge arrangements declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect the company’s pension fund which in turn could increase funding requirements 

 

we believe that the following recent transactions and trends and uncertainties may impact liquidity

the indenture governing the 2011 and 2012 notes among other things limits the company’s ability to incur indebtedness secured by principal properties to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and to enter into certain mergers or transfers of substantially all of dps’ assets the 2011 and 2012 notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the company’s existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 

 

the 2013 2018 and 2038 notes 

 

during 2008 the company completed the issuance of 1700 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of the 2013 2018 and 2038 notes the weighted average interest rate of the 2013 2018 and 2038 notes was 68 for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 and is subject to adjustment interest expense was 117 million and 78 million which included amortization of deferred financing costs of 1 million each for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes among other things limits the company’s ability to incur indebtedness secured by principal properties to enter into certain sale and lease back transactions and to enter into certain mergers or transfers of substantially all of dps’ assets the senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the company’s existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 

bridge loan facility and separation from cadbury 

 

the company’s bridge credit agreement provided a senior unsecured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 1700 million with a term of 364 days from the date the bridge loan facility is funded 

 

on april 11 2008 dps borrowed 1700 million under the bridge loan facility to reduce financing risks and facilitate cadbury’s separation of the company all of the proceeds from the borrowings were placed into interestbearing collateral accounts on april 30 2008 borrowings under the bridge loan facility were released from the collateral account containing such funds and returned to the lenders and the 364day bridge loan facility was terminated for the year ended december 31 2008 the company incurred 24 million of costs associated with the bridge loan facility financing fees of 21 million which were expensed when the bridge loan facility was terminated and 5 million of interest expense were included as a component of interest expense these costs were partially offset as the company earned 2 million in interest income on the bridge loan while in escrow 

 

on may 7 2008 upon the company’s separation from cadbury the borrowings under the term loan a facility and the net proceeds of the senior unsecured notes were released to dps from collateral accounts and escrow accounts the company used the funds to settle with cadbury related party debt and other balances eliminate cadbury’s net investment in the company purchase certain assets from cadbury related to dps’ business and pay fees and expenses related to the company’s credit facilities 

 

use of proceeds 

 

we used the funds from the term loan a and the net proceeds of the 2013 2018 and 2038 notes to settle with cadbury related party debt and other balances eliminate cadbury’s net investment in us purchase certain assets from cadbury related to our business and pay fees and expenses related to our credit facilities we used the funds from the 2011 and 2012 notes to partially repay principal associated with the term loan a 

 

debt ratings 

 

as of december 31 2009 our debt ratings were baa3 with a stable outlook from moody’s investor service and bbbwith a positive outlook from standard  poor’s we are currently on positive watch by both rating agencies 

 

these debt ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements a downgrade of one or both of our debt ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations 

 

cash management 

 

prior to separation our cash was available for use and was regularly swept by cadbury operations in the united states at its discretion cadbury also funded our operating and investing activities as needed we earned interest income on certain related party balances our interest income has been reduced due to the settlement of the related party balances upon separation and accordingly we expect interest income for 2010 to be minimal 

 

post separation we fund our liquidity needs from cash flow from operations and amounts available under financing arrangements 

 

capital expenditures 

 

capital expenditures were 317 million 304 million and 230 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively capital expenditures for all periods primarily consisted of expansion of our capabilities in existing facilities cold drink equipment and it investments for new systems the increase in expenditures for 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily related to costs of a new manufacturing and distribution center in victorville california the increase in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily related to early stage costs of a new manufacturing and distribution center in victorville california we continue to expect to incur discretionary annual capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposals in an amount equal to approximately 5 of our net sales which we expect to fund through cash provided by operating activities 

restructuring 

 

we have implemented restructuring programs from time to time and have incurred costs that are designed to improve operating effectiveness and lower costs these programs have included closure of manufacturing plants reductions in force integration of back office operations and outsourcing of certain transactional activities we recorded 57 million and 76 million of restructuring costs for 2008 and 2007 respectively there were no significant restructuring costs in 2009 refer to note 13 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

liquidity 

 

based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our revolver 

 

the following table summarizes our cash activity for 2009 2008 and 2007 in millions 

 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 156 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 the 867 million increase in net income included a 1039 million decrease in the noncash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets a 62 million increase in the gain on the disposal of intangible assets primarily due to a onetime gain recorded in 2009 upon the termination of the hansen distribution agreement and an increase of 344 million in deferred income taxes driven by the impairment of intangible assets in 2008 changes in working capital included an 80 million favorable increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a decrease of 50 million in other noncurrent liabilities accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to higher accruals for customer promotion and employee compensation increased inventory purchases and improved cash management by paying vendors in accordance with invoice terms other noncurrent liabilities decreased primarily due to payments associated with the company’s pension and postretirement employee benefit plans 

 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was 709 million compared to 603 million in 2007 the 809 million decrease in net income included a 1033 million increase in the noncash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets an 83 million decrease in the gain on the disposal of assets due to a onetime gain recorded in 2007 upon the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement an increase of 39 million in depreciation and amortization expense driven by higher capital expenditures and the amortization of capitalized financing costs and the impact of the writeoff of 21 million of deferred financing costs related to our bridge loan facility these amounts were partially offset by a decrease of 296 million in deferred income taxes driven by the impairment of intangible assets changes in working capital included a 71 million favorable decrease in inventory primarily due to improved inventory management and lower sales volumes offset by an increase of 43 million in trade accounts receivable and a 43 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses trade accounts receivable increased despite reduced collection times due to an increase in sales in december 2008 accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased primarily due to lower inventory purchases as we focus on inventory management cash provided by operations was also impacted by our separation from cadbury 

net cash provided by investing activities 

 

the decrease of 1325 million in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 was primarily attributable to related party notes receivable due to the separation from cadbury during 2008 for 2008 cash provided by net repayments of related party notes receivable of 1375 million for 2008 we increased capital expenditures by 13 million in the current year primarily due to the build out of the new manufacturing and distribution center in victorville california capital asset investments for both years primarily consisted of expansion of our capabilities in existing facilities replacement of existing cold drink equipment it investments for new systems and upgrades to the vehicle fleet additionally cash used in investing activities for 2009 included 68 million in proceeds primarily from the termination of hansen’s distributor agreement 

 

the increase of 2161 million in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 compared with the year ended december 31 2007 was primarily attributable to related party notes receivable due to the separation from cadbury for 2007 cash used in net issuances of related party notes receivable totaled 929 million compared with cash provided by net repayments of related party notes receivable of 1375 million for 2008 we increased capital expenditures by 74 million in the current year primarily due to early stage costs of a new manufacturing and distribution center in victorville california capital asset investments for both years primarily consisted of expansion of our capabilities in existing facilities replacement of existing cold drink equipment it investments for new systems and upgrades to the vehicle fleet additionally cash used by investing activities for 2007 included 98 million in proceeds from the disposal of assets primarily attributable to the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement partially offset by net cash used in the acquisition of seabev 

 

net cash provided by financing activities 

 

the decrease of 1071 million in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 was driven by payments of third party longterm debt partially offset by the proceeds from senior unsecured notes and the revolver 

 

the following table summarizes the issuances and payments of third party and related party debt for 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

the increase of 2140 million in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 compared with the year ended december 31 2007 was driven by the change in cadbury’s investment as part of our separation from cadbury and payments of third party longterm debt this increase was partially offset by the issuances of third party longterm debt 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

 

cash and cash equivalents were 280 million as of december 31 2009 an increase of 66 million from 214 million as of december 31 2008 the increase was primarily due to our overall improvement in our operating activities during 2009 

 

our cash is used to fund working capital requirements scheduled debt and interest payments capital expenditures income tax obligations and in future years will be used for dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock cash available in our foreign operations may not be immediately available for these purposes foreign cash balances constitute approximately 32 of our total cash position as of december 31 2009 

 

dividends 

 

on november 20 2009 the company’s board declared our first dividend of 015 per share on outstanding common stock payable january 8 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 21 2009 

 

on february 3 2010 the company’s board declared a dividend of 015 per share on the common stock of the company payable on april 9 2010 to the stockholders of record at the close of business on march 22 2010 

 

common stock repurchases 

 

on november 20 2009 the board authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million of the company’s outstanding common stock over the next three years subsequent to the board’s authorization we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the remainder of 2009 subsequent to december 31 2009 the board authorized the repurchase of an additional 800 million of the company’s outstanding common stock for a total of 1 billion authorized 

contractual commitments and obligations 

 

we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies at december 31 2009 in millions based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize amounts available under our revolver refer to notes 9 and 15 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the items described in this table 

 

 

 

 

  

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” we had 534 million of unrecognized tax benefits related interest and penalties as of december 31 2009 classified as a longterm liability the table above does not reflect any payments related to tax reserves if it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

there are no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

 

other matters 

 

agreement with pepsico inc 

 

on december 8 2009 dps agreed to license certain brands to pepsico inc “pepsico” on closing of pepsico’s proposed acquisitions of pbg and pas 

 

under the new licensing agreements pepsico will distribute dr pepper crush and schweppes in the us territories where these brands are currently distributed by pbg and pas the same will apply for dr pepper crush schweppes vernors and sussex in canada and squirt and canada dry in mexico 

 

under the agreements dps will receive a onetime cash payment of 900 million the new agreement will have an initial period of twenty years with automatic twenty year renewal periods and will require pepsico to meet certain performance conditions the payment will be recorded as deferred revenue which will be recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated 25year life of the customer relationship 

 

additionally in us territories where it has a distribution footprint dps will begin distributing certain owned and licensed brands including sunkist soda squirt vernors canada dry and hawaiian punch that were previously distributed by pbg and pas 

 

on february 26 2010 the company completed the licensing of those brands to pepsico following pepsico’s acquisitions of pbg and pas 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary actual amounts may differ from these estimates and judgments we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting estimates see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred 1 delivery 2 persuasive evidence of an agreement exists 3 pricing is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the customer and us the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on contract terms for sales to customers that are designated in the contract as freeonboard destination revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to and accepted at the customer’s delivery site net sales are reported net of costs associated with customer marketing programs and incentives as described below as well as sales taxes and other similar taxes 

 

customer marketing programs and incentives 

 

the company offers a variety of incentives and discounts to bottlers customers and consumers through various programs to support the distribution of its products these incentives and discounts include cash discounts price allowances volume based rebates product placement fees and other financial support for items such as trade promotions displays new products consumer incentives and advertising assistance these incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales the aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately 3419 million 3057 million and 3159 million 

in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during 2009 the company upgraded its sap platform in dsd as part of the upgrade dps harmonized its gross list price structure across locations the impact of the change increased gross sales and related discounts by equal amounts on customer invoices net sales were not affected the amounts of trade spend are larger in our packaged beverages segment than those related to other parts of our business accruals are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms volumebased metrics andor historical trends and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels 

 

goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 

 

in accordance with us gaap we classify intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill the majority of our intangible asset balance is made up of brands which we have determined to have indefinite useful lives in arriving at the conclusion that a brand has an indefinite useful life management reviews factors such as size diversification and market share of each brand management expects to acquire hold and support brands for an indefinite period through consumer marketing and promotional support we also consider factors such as our ability to continue to protect the legal rights that arise from these brand names indefinitely or the absence of any regulatory economic or competitive factors that could truncate the life of the brand name if the criteria are not met to assign an indefinite life the brand is amortized over its expected useful life 

 

we conduct tests for impairment in accordance with us gaap for intangible assets with definite lives we conduct tests for impairment if conditions indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives we conduct tests for impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination and also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units we define reporting units as beverage concentrates latin america beverages and packaged beverages’ two reporting units dsd and wd 

 

the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is recorded the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges “step 1” if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is indicated and a second step “step 2” analysis must be performed 

 

the tests for impairment include significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets primarily by analyzing forecasts of future revenues and profit performance fair value is based on what the intangible asset would be worth to a third party market participant discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt adjusted with various risk premiums these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various of the risks discussed in “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

 

for our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2009 and 2008 methodologies used to determine the fair values of the assets included a combination of the income based approach and market based approach as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and our enterprise value management’s estimates which fall under level 3 are based on historical and projected operating performance recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples 

 

as of december 31 2009 the results of the step 1 analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values and therefore are not impaired 

 

the results of the step 1 analyses performed as of december 31 2008 indicated there was a potential impairment of goodwill in the dsd reporting unit as the book value exceeded the estimated fair value as a result step 2 of the goodwill impairment test was performed for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill 

determined in the step 2 analysis was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the applicable reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and related deferred taxes as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as a result of the step 2 analysis we impaired the entire dsd reporting unit’s goodwill 

 

the step 2 analysis in 2008 resulted in noncash charges of 1039 million which are reported in the line item impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in our consolidated statement of operations a summary of the impairment charges for 2008 is provided below in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table summarizes the critical assumptions that were used in estimating fair value for our annual impairment tests performed as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

for the dsd reporting unit’s goodwill keeping the residual operating income growth rate constant but changing the discount rate downward by 050 would indicate less of an impairment charge of approximately 60 million keeping the discount rate constant and increasing the residual operating income growth rate by 050 would indicate less of an impairment charge of approximately 10 million an increase of 050 in the estimated operating income growth rate would reduce the goodwill impairment charge by approximately 75 million 

 

for the snapple brand keeping the residual operating income growth rate constant but changing the discount rate by 050 would result in a 45 million to 50 million change in the impairment charge keeping the discount rate constant but changing the residual operating income growth rate by 050 would result in a 30 million to 35 million change in the impairment charge of the snapple brand a change of 025 in the estimated operating income growth rate would change the impairment charge by approximately 25 million 

a change in the critical assumptions detailed above would not result in a change to the impairment charge related to distribution rights 

 

the results of our annual impairment tests indicated that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill not discussed above exceeded their carrying values and therefore were not impaired 

 

based on triggering events in the second and third quarters of 2008 we performed interim impairment analyses of the snapple brand and the dsd reporting unit’s goodwill and concluded there was no impairment as of june 30 and september 30 2008 respectively however deteriorating economic and market conditions in the fourth quarter triggered higher discount rates as well as lower volume and growth projections which drove the impairments of the dsd reporting unit’s goodwill snapple brand and the dsd reporting unit’s distribution rights recorded in the fourth quarter indicative of the economic and market conditions our average stock price declined 19 in the fourth quarter as compared to the average stock price from may 7 2008 the date of our separation from cadbury through september 30 2008 the impairment of the distribution rights was attributed to insufficient net economic returns above working capital fixed assets and assembled workforce 

 

definite lived intangible assets 

 

definite lived intangible assets are those assets deemed by the management to have determinable finite useful lives identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives as follows 

 

 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for our stockbased compensation plans under us gaap which requires the recognition of compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value of employee sharebased awards determining the amount of expense for stockbased compensation as well as the associated impact to our balance sheets and statements of cash flows requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stockbased compensation expense the most significant factors of that expense that require estimates or projections include the expected volatility expected lives and estimated forfeiture rates of stockbased awards as we lack a meaningful set of historical data upon which to develop valuation assumptions we have elected to develop certain valuation assumptions based on information disclosed by similarlysituated companies including multinational consumer goods companies of similar market capitalization and large food and beverage industry companies which have experienced an initial public offering since june 2001 

 

in accordance with us gaap we recognize the cost of all unvested employee stock options on a straightline attribution basis over their respective vesting periods net of estimated forfeitures prior to our separation from cadbury we participated in certain employee share plans that contained inflation indexed earnings growth performance conditions these plans were accounted for under the liability method of us gaap in accordance with us gaap a liability was recorded on the balance sheet until and in calculating the income statement charge for share awards the fair value of each award was remeasured at each reporting date until awards vested we no longer participate in employee share plans that contain inflation indexed earnings growth performance conditions 

 

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

we have several pension and postretirement plans covering employees who satisfy age and length of service requirements there are eleven standalone noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and six standalone postretirement plans depending on the plan pension and postretirement benefits are based on a combination of factors which may include salary age and years of service 

pension expense has been determined in accordance with the principles of us gaap our policy is to fund pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions employee demographic data years of service compensation benefits and claims paid and employer contributions 

 

the expense related to the postretirement plans has been determined in accordance with us gaap we accrue the cost of these benefits during the years that employees render service to us in accordance with us gaap 

 

the calculation of pension and postretirement plan obligations and related expenses is dependent on several assumptions used to estimate the present value of the benefits earned while the employee is eligible to participate in the plans the key assumptions we use in determining the plan obligations and related expenses include 1 the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities 2 employee turnover retirement age and mortality and 3 the expected return on plan assets our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance due to the significant judgment required our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and postretirement obligations and expenses refer to note 15 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

the effect of a 1 increase or decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the pension benefit obligations for us plans would change the benefit obligation as of december 31 2009 by approximately 24 million and 26 million respectively the effect of a 1 increase or decrease in the weightedaverage assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended december 31 2009 by approximately 3 million each 

 

risk management programs 

 

we retain selected levels of property casualty workers’ compensation health and other business risks many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or selfinsured retentions accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty and health risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends these loss development factors are established in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries at december 31 2009 and 2008 we had accrued liabilities related to the retained risks of 68 million and 60 million respectively including both current and longterm liabilities prior to our separation from cadbury we participated in insurance programs placed by cadbury prior to and upon separation cadbury retained the risk and accrued liabilities for the exposures insured under these insurance programs 

 

we believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our selfinsured liabilities however the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known the final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents medical cost inflation legislative actions uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control 

 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are computed and reported on a separate return basis and accounted for using the asset and liability approach in accordance with us gaap this method involves determining the temporary differences between combined assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and the corresponding combined amounts recognized for tax purposes and computing the taxrelated carryforwards at the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the resulting amounts are deferred tax assets or liabilities and the net changes represent the deferred tax expense or benefit for the year the total of taxes currently payable per the tax return and the deferred tax expense or benefit represents the income tax expense or benefit for the year for financial reporting purposes 

we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings our estimate of current and expected future earnings prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and current and future ownership changes 

 

as of december 31 2009 and 2008 undistributed earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in nonus subsidiaries totaled approximately 115 million and 124 million respectively deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income as the company believes these earnings to be permanently reinvested it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on these undistributed foreign earnings 

 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to various factors including but not limited to total earnings and the mix of earnings by jurisdiction the timing of changes in tax laws and the amount of tax provided for uncertain tax positions

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including inflation movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading purposes 

 

foreign exchange risk 

 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in united states dollars however we do have some exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2009 the impact to net income of a 10 change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately 14 million 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variable rate debt 

 

we are subject to floating interest rate risk with respect to amounts borrowed under our unsecured revolver we incurred 405 million of debt with floating interest rates under this facility a change in the estimated interest rate on the outstanding balance of borrowings under the unsecured revolver up or down by 1 will increase or decrease our earnings before provision for income taxes by approximately 4 million respectively on an annual basis we will also have interest rate exposure for any additional amounts we may borrow in the future under the revolver 

 

interest rate fair value hedges 

 

dps enters into interest rate swaps to convert fixedrate longterm debt to floatingrate debt these swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges under us gaap these fair value hedges qualify for the shortcut method of recognition therefore no portion of these swaps is treated as ineffective 

in december 2009 the company entered into two interest rate swaps having an aggregate notional amount of 850 million and durations ranging from two to three years in order to convert fixedrate longterm debt to floating rate debt these swaps were entered into at the inception of the 2011 and 2012 notes see notes 9 and 10 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

as a result of these interest rate swaps the company pays an average floating rate which fluctuates semiannually based on libor the average floating rate to be paid by the company as of december 31 2009 was less than 10 the average fixed rate to be received by the company as of december 31 2009 was 20 

 

interest rate economic hedge 

 

the company had an interest rate swap originally designated as a cash flow hedge effective december 31 2009 with a duration of 12 months and a 750 million notional amount that amortizes at the rate of 100 million every quarter and converts variable interest rates to fixed rates of 373 as of december 31 2009 the cash flow hedging was discontinued but the interest rate swap had not been terminated borrowings under the revolver have similar terms to the term loan a in this case there exists a natural hedging relationship in which changes in the fair value of the instruments act as an economic offset to changes in the fair value of the underlying items changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded as interest expense throughout the term of the derivative instrument and are reported in the same line item as the hedged transaction 

 

commodity risks 

 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of aluminum corn for high fructose corn syrup natural gas for use in processing and packaging pet and fuel 

 

we utilize commodities forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2009 was an asset of 10 million 

 

as of december 31 2009 the impact to net income of a 10 change in market prices of these commodities is estimated to be approximately 22 million

focus on opportunities in high growth and high margin categories we are focused on driving growth in our business in selected profitable and emerging categories these categories include readytodrink teas energy drinks and other beverages we also intend to capitalize on opportunities in these categories through brand extensions new product launches and selective acquisitions of brands and distribution rights for example we believe we are wellpositioned to enter into new distribution agreements for emerging highgrowth third party brands in new categories that can use our bottling and distribution network we can provide these new brands with distribution capability and resources to grow and they provide us with exposure to growing segments of the market with relatively low risk and capital investment 

 

increase presence in high margin channels and packages we are focused on improving our product presence in high margin channels such as convenience stores vending machines and small independent retail outlets through increased selling activity and significant investments in coolers and other cold drink equipment we intend to significantly increase the number of our branded coolers and other cold drink equipment over the next few years which we believe will provide an attractive return on investment we also intend to increase demand for high margin products like singleserve packages for many of our key brands through increased promotional activity

manufacturing 

 

as of december 31 2008 we operated 24 manufacturing facilities across the united states and mexico almost all of our csd beverage concentrates are manufactured at a single plant in st louis missouri all of our manufacturing facilities are either regional manufacturing facilities with the capacity and capabilities to manufacture many brands and packages facilities with particular capabilities that are dedicated to certain brands or products or smaller bottling plants with a more limited range of packaging capabilities we intend to build and open a new multiproduct manufacturing facility in southern california within the next two years

raw materials 

 

the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paper products sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients the cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially in addition we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses 

 

under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging manufacturing costs for our finished goods segment where we manufacture and bottle finished beverages are higher as a percentage of our net sales than our beverage concentrates segment as the finished goods segment requires the purchase of a much larger portion of the packaging and ingredients although we have contracts with a relatively small number of suppliers we have generally not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required amount of raw materials 

 

when appropriate we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process through the use of futures contracts and supplier pricing agreements the intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure

our research and development team is composed of scientists and engineers in the united states and mexico who are focused on developing high quality products which have broad consumer appeal can be sold at competitive prices and can be safely and consistently produced across a diverse manufacturing network our research and development team engages in activities relating to product development microbiology analytical chemistry process engineering sensory science nutrition knowledge management and regulatory compliance we have particular expertise in flavors and sweeteners research and development costs amounted to 17 million in 2008 and totaled 14 million for each of 2007 and 2006 net of allocations to cadbury additionally we incurred packaging engineering costs of 4 million 5 million and 3 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business regulations apply to many aspects of our business including our products and their ingredients manufacturing safety labeling transportation recycling advertising and sale for example our products and their manufacturing labeling marketing and sale in the united states are subject to various aspects of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal trade commission act the lanham act state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws in canada and mexico the manufacture distribution marketing and sale of our many products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations 

 

we and our bottlers use various refillable and nonrefillable recyclable bottles and cans in the united states and other countries various states and other authorities require deposits ecotaxes or fees on certain containers similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local state and federal levels both in the united states and elsewhere in mexico the government has encouraged the soft drinks industry to comply voluntarily with collection and recycling programs of plastic material and we have taken steps to comply with these programs 

 

environmental health and safety matters 

 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to a variety of federal state and local environment health and safety laws and regulations we maintain environmental health and safety policies and a quality environmental health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations the cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations 

 

available information 

 

our web site address is wwwdrpeppersnapplegroupcom we make available free of charge through this web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 

 

market and industry data 

 

the market and industry data in this annual report on form 10k is from independent industry sources including the nielsen company and beverage digest although we believe that these independent sources are reliable we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of this data or any assumptions underlying such data 

 

the nielsen company is a marketing information provider primarily serving consumer packaged goods manufacturers and retailers we use the nielsen company data as our primary management tool to track market performance because it has broad and deep data coverage is based on consumer transactions at retailers and is reported to us monthly the nielsen company data provides measurement and analysis of marketplace trends such as market share retail pricing promotional activity and distribution across various channels retailers and geographies measured categories provided to us by the nielsen company scantrack include flavored noncola carbonated soft drinks “csds” energy drinks singleserve bottled water nonalcoholic mixers and noncarbonated beverages including readytodrink teas singleserve and multiserve juice and juice drinks and 

sports drinks the nielsen company also provides data on other food items such as apple sauce the nielsen company data we present in this report is from the nielsen company’s scantrack service which compiles data based on scanner transactions in certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers drug chains convenience stores and gas stations however this data does not include the fountain or vending channels walmart or small independent retail outlets which together represent a meaningful portion of the united states liquid refreshment beverage market and of our net sales and volume 

 

beverage digest is an independent beverage research company that publishes an annual beverage digest fact book we use beverage digest primarily to track market share information and broad beverage and channel trends this annual publication provides a compilation of data supplied by beverage companies beverage digest covers the following categories csds energy drinks bottled water and noncarbonated beverages including readytodrink teas juice and juice drinks and sports drinks beverage digest data does not include multiserve juice products or bottled water in packages of 15 liters or more data is reported for certain sales channels including grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores drug chains convenience stores gas stations fountains vending machines and the “upanddownthestreet” channel consisting of small independent retail outlets 

 

we use both the nielsen company and beverage digest to assess both our own and our competitors’ performance and market share in the united states different market share rankings can result for a specific beverage category depending on whether data from the nielsen company or beverage digest is used in part because of the differences in the sales channels reported by each source for example because the fountain channel where we have a relatively small business except for dr pepper is not included in the nielsen company data our market share using the nielsen company data is generally higher for our csd portfolio than the beverage digest data which does include the fountain channel 

 

in this annual report on form 10k all information regarding the beverage market in the united states is from beverage digest and except as otherwise indicated is from 2007 all information regarding our brand market positions in the us is from the nielsen company and is based on retail dollar sales in 2008

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

risks related to our business 

 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties could harm our business and financial condition 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

 

our industry is highly competitive we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources including cocacola and pepsico and their related affiliated systems these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products reducing prices or increasing promotional activities we also compete against a variety of smaller regional and private label manufacturers smaller companies may be more innovative better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets our inability to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales as a result we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing advertising and product innovation any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences trends health concerns and other factors 

 

consumers’ preferences can change due to a variety of factors including aging of the population social trends negative publicity economic downturn or other factors for example consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness and demand for regular csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards low or no calorie soft drinks and increasingly to ncbs such as water readytodrink teas and sports drinks if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences then quickly develop new products in 

response our sales could suffer developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales 

 

food and beverage retailers in the united states have been consolidating resulting in large sophisticated retailers with increased buying power they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices they also have leverage to require us to provide larger more tailored promotional and product delivery programs if we and our bottlers and distributors do not successfully provide appropriate marketing product packaging pricing and service to these retailers our product availability sales and margins could suffer certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products’ retail volume including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors for example walmart stores inc the largest retailer of our products represented approximately 11 of our net sales in 2008 some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands the loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

 

we depend on third party bottling and distribution companies for a substantial portion of our business 

 

we generate a substantial portion of our net sales from sales of beverage concentrates to third party bottling companies during 2008 approximately twothirds of our beverage concentrates volume was sold to bottlers that we do not own some of these bottlers are partly owned by our competitors and much of their business comes from selling our competitors’ products in addition some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties as independent companies these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions they may have the right to determine whether and to what extent they produce and distribute our products our competitors’ products and their own products they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands in most cases they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party bottlers any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had 86 billion of total assets of which approximately 57 billion were intangible assets intangible assets include goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with brands bottler agreements distribution rights and customer relationships we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of december 31 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2008 resulted in pretax noncash impairment charges of 1039 million for additional information about these intangible assets see “critical accounting estimates — goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets” in item 7 and our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k 

 

the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of intangible assets since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles will occur in the future any such impairment would result in us recognizing a charge to our operating results which may adversely affect our financial performance 

we have a significant amount of outstanding debt which could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

as of december 31 2008 our total indebtedness was 3524 million this significant amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors including 

 

  

to the extent we become more leveraged or experience deteriorating economic conditions the risks described above would increase additionally it may become more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures other corporate purposes and to grow our business could be reduced and the future credit ratings of our debt could be downgraded which could increase future debt costs our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt 

 

in addition the credit agreement governing our debt contains covenants that among other things limit our ability to incur debt at subsidiaries that are not guarantors incur liens merge or sell transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into agreements restricting our ability to incur liens or the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions the agreement also requires us to comply with certain affirmative and financial covenants 

 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by the recent global financial events 

 

the recent global financial events have resulted in the consolidation failure or near failure of a number of institutions in the banking insurance and investment banking industries and have substantially reduced the ability of companies to obtain financing these events have also led to a substantial reduction in stock market valuations these events could have a number of different effects on our business including 

 

  

other events or conditions may arise directly or indirectly from the global financial events that could negatively impact our business 

 

litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

 

we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings we evaluate these claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate if possible the amount of potential losses we may establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies 

we base our assessments estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates actual settlements judgments or resolutions of these claims or proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance for more information see note 22 of the notes to our audited consolidated financials statements 

 

benefits cost increases could reduce our profitability 

 

our profitability is substantially affected by the costs of pension postretirement and employee medical costs and employee other benefits in recent years these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities although we actively seek to control increases in costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in costs could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial performance 

 

costs for our raw materials may increase substantially 

 

the principal raw materials we use in our business are aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles and caps paperboard packaging sweeteners juice fruit water and other ingredients additionally conversion of raw materials into our products for sale also uses electricity and natural gas the cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially we are significantly impacted by increases in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses under many of our supply arrangements the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs such as aluminum in the case of cans natural gas in the case of glass bottles resin in the case of pet bottles and caps corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging continued price increases could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

certain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur 

 

some raw materials we use such as aluminum cans and ends glass bottles pet bottles sweeteners and other ingredients are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases changing suppliers can require long lead times the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons including fires natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease crop failure strikes transportation interruption government regulation political instability and terrorism a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties including bankruptcy some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or lessdeveloped countries or regions any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance 

 

substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur 

 

a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility which manufactures almost all of our concentrates could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers bottlers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation interruption government regulation or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading 

 

we have an ongoing program of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing distribution and other facilities we expect to incur substantial costs to upgrade or keep uptodate various facilities and equipment or 

restructure our operations including closing existing facilities or opening new ones if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected 

 

we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we could experience strikes 

 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 5000 of our employees many of whom are at our key manufacturing locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all this could result in strikes or work stoppages which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales the terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency 

 

our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated 

 

we have adopted various quality environmental health and safety standards however our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers distributors or suppliers this could result in expensive production interruptions recalls and liability claims moreover negative publicity could be generated from false unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property including termination of distribution rights could harm our business 

 

we possess intellectual property that is important to our business this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets see “intellectual property and trademarks” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information we and third parties including competitors could come into conflict over intellectual property rights litigation could disrupt our business divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our brands products and business could be harmed 

 

we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties in some countries other companies own a particular trademark which we own in the united states canada or mexico for example the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by cocacola in certain other countries adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could affect our use of the trademark and negatively impact our brands 

 

in some cases we license products from third parties which we distribute the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance for example in letters dated october 10 2008 and december 11 2008 we received formal notification from hansen natural corporation terminating our agreements to distribute monster energy as well as other hansen’s beverage brands in certain markets in the united states and mexico effective november 10 2008 and january 26 2009 respectively 

 

we may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations and they could change 

 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the united states canada mexico and other countries in which we do business these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture safety labeling transportation advertising and sale of our products see “regulatory matters” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding many of these laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation andor result in regulatory actions 

with substantial penalties in addition any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures for example changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs regulatory focus on the health safety and marketing of food products is increasing certain state warning and labeling laws such as california’s “prop 65” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects could become applicable to our products some local and regional governments and school boards have enacted or have proposed to enact regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in schools any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or disrupt the production or distribution of our products and negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

we may not realize benefits of acquisitions 

 

we have recently acquired various bottling and distribution businesses and are integrating their operations into our business we may pursue further acquisitions of independent bottlers distributors and distribution rights to complement our existing capabilities and further expand the distribution of our brands we may also pursue acquisition of brands and products to expand our brand portfolio the failure to successfully identify make and integrate acquisitions may impede the growth of our business the timing or success of any acquisition and integration is uncertain requires significant expenses and diverts financial and managerial resources away from our existing businesses we also may not be able to raise the substantial capital or debt required for acquisitions and integrations on satisfactory terms if at all in addition even after an acquisition we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business or brand or realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition all of which could have a negative effect on our business and financial performance 

 

we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel 

 

our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees both individually and as a group and our ability to retain and motivate them our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected we do not have “key person” life insurance for any of our executive officers or key employees 

 

we depend on key information systems and third party service providers 

 

we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business provide information to management and prepare financial reports we rely on third party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services including hosting our primary data center and processing various accounting order entry and other transactional services these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from among other things natural disasters terrorist attacks software equipment or telecommunications failures processing errors computer viruses hackers other security issues or supplier defaults security backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors processing inefficiencies security breaches inability to use the systems or process transactions loss of customers or other business disruptions all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

 

weather and climate changes could adversely affect our business 

 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials energy and fuel and demand for our products unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance

the periods presented in this section are the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 which we refer to as “2008” “2007” and “2006” respectively the following discussion and analysis includes the effects of the restatement of net sales as discussed in note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 

 

business overview 

 

we are a leading integrated brand owner bottler and distributor of nonalcoholic beverages in the united states canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored csds and ncbs including readytodrink teas juices juice drinks and mixers our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper 7up sunkist aw canada dry schweppes squirt and peñafiel and ncb brands such as snapple mott’s hawaiian punch clamato mr  mrs t margaritaville and rose’s our largest brand dr pepper is a leading flavored csd in the united states according to the nielsen company we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers 

 

we operate primarily in the united states mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean in 2008 89 of our net sales were generated in the united states 4 in canada and 7 in mexico and the caribbean 

 

our business model 

 

we operate as a brand owner a bottler and a distributor 

 

our brand ownership businesses as a brand owner we build our brands by promoting brand awareness through marketing advertising and promotion and by developing new and innovative products and product line extensions that address consumer preferences and needs as the owner of the formulas and proprietary knowhow required for the preparation of beverages we manufacture sell and distribute beverage concentrates and syrups used primarily to produce csds and we manufacture bottle sell and distribute primarily finished ncbs most of our sales of beverage concentrates are to bottlers who manufacture bottle sell and distribute our branded products into retail channels we also manufacture sell and distribute syrups for use in beverage fountain dispensers to restaurants and retailers as well as to fountain wholesalers who resell it to restaurants and retailers in addition we distribute finished ncbs through ourselves and through third party distributors 

 

our beverage concentrates and syrup brand ownership businesses are characterized by relatively low capital investment raw materials and employee costs although the cost of building or acquiring an established brand can be significant established brands typically do not require significant ongoing expenditures other than marketing and therefore generate relatively high margins our finished beverages brand ownership business has characteristics of both of our beverage concentrates and syrup brand ownership businesses as well as our bottling and distribution businesses discussed below 

 

our bottling and distribution businesses we manufacture bottle sell and distribute finished csds from concentrates and finished ncbs and products mostly from ingredients other than concentrates we sell and distribute finished beverages and other products primarily into retail channels either directly to retail shelves or to warehouses through our large fleet of delivery trucks or through third party logistics providers 

 

our bottling and distribution businesses are characterized by relatively high capital investment raw material selling and distribution costs in each case compared to our beverage concentrates and syrup brand ownership 

businesses our capital costs include investing in and maintaining our manufacturing and warehouse equipment and facilities our raw material costs include purchasing concentrates ingredients and packaging materials from a variety of suppliers our selling and distribution costs include significant costs related to operating our large fleet of delivery trucks and employing a significant number of employees to sell and deliver finished beverages and other products to retailers as a result of the high fixed costs associated with these types of businesses we are focused on maintaining an adequate level of volumes as well as controlling capital expenditures raw material selling and distribution costs in addition geographic proximity to our customers is a critical component of managing the high cost of transporting finished beverages relative to their retail price the profitability of the bottling and distribution businesses is also dependent upon our ability to sell our products into higher margin channels as a result of these factors the margins of our bottling and distribution businesses are significantly lower than those of our brand ownership businesses in light of the largely fixed cost nature of the bottling and distribution businesses increases in costs for example raw materials tied to commodity prices could have a significant negative impact on the margins of our businesses 

 

approximately 89 of our 2008 bottling group net sales of branded products come from our own brands with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as monster energy drink fiji mineral water and arizona tea in addition a small portion of our bottling group sales come from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others for a fee 

 

integrated business model we believe our brand ownership bottling and distribution are more integrated than the united states operations of our principal competitors and that this differentiation provides us with a competitive advantage we believe our integrated business model 

 

  

trends affecting our business 

 

according to data from beverage digest in 2007 the united states csd market segment grew by 27 in retail sales despite a 23 decline in total csd volume the united states ncb volume and retail sales increased by 64 and 96 respectively in 2007 in addition ncbs experienced strong growth over the last five years with their volume share of the overall us liquid refreshment beverage market increasing from 130 in 2002 to 170 in 2007 

 

we believe the key trends influencing the north american liquid refreshment beverage market include 

 

 23 

 

  

seasonality 

 

the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 

 

segments 

 

we report our business in four segments beverage concentrates finished goods bottling group and mexico and the caribbean 

 

  

due to our integrated business model we manage our business to maximize profitability for our company as a whole as a result profitability trends in individual segments may not be consistent with the profitability of our company or comparable to our competitors for example following the bottling acquisitions in 2006 as described below we changed certain funding and manufacturing arrangements between our beverage concentrates and finished goods segments and our newly acquired bottling companies which reduced the profitability of our bottling group segment while benefiting our other segments 

 

we have significant intersegment transactions for example our bottling group purchases concentrates at an arm’s length price from our beverage concentrates segment we expect these purchases to account for approximately onethird of our beverage concentrates segment annual net sales and therefore drive a similar proportion of our beverage concentrates segment profitability in addition our bottling group segment purchases finished beverages from our finished goods segment all intersegment transactions are eliminated in preparing our consolidated results of operations 

 

we incur selling general and administrative expenses in each of our segments in our segment reporting the selling general and administrative expenses of our bottling group and mexico and the caribbean segments relate primarily to those segments however as a result of our historical segment reporting policies certain combined 

selling activities that support our beverage concentrates and finished goods segments have not been proportionally allocated between those two segments we also incur certain centralized functional and corporate costs that support our entire business which have not been directly allocated to our respective segments but rather have been allocated primarily to our beverage concentrates segment 

 

the key financial measures management uses to assess the performance of our segments are net sales and underlying operating profit loss “uop” 

 

the impact of foreign currency is excluded from segments’ net sales and is included as a component of intersegment eliminations and impact of foreign currency in the reconciliation to reported consolidated net sales 

 

significant acquisitions 

 

on may 2 2006 we acquired approximately 55 of the outstanding shares of dpsubg which combined with our preexisting 45 ownership resulted in our full ownership of dpsubg dpsubg’s results have been included in the individual line items within our consolidated financial statements beginning on may 2 2006 prior to this date the existing investment in dpsubg was accounted for under the equity method and reflected in the line item captioned equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations in addition on june 9 2006 we acquired the assets of all american bottling company on august 7 2006 we acquired seven up bottling company of san francisco and on july 11 2007 we acquired southeastatlantic beverage corporation “seabev” each of these acquisitions is included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on its date of acquisition refer to note 5 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information

in evaluating our performance we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates and syrups or finished beverages 

 

beverage concentrates sales volume 

 

in our beverage concentrates and syrup businesses we measure our sales volume in two ways 1 “concentrates case sales” and 2 “bottler case sales” the unit of measurement for both concentrates case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage or 24 twelve ounce servings 

 

concentrates case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates and syrups sold by us to our bottlers and distributors a concentrates case is the amount of concentrates needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrates our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates cases sold 

 

although our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates case sales we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of our finished beverages into retail channels 

 

finished beverages sales volume 

 

in our finished beverages businesses we measure volume as case sales to customers a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage sold by us case sales include both our ownedbrands and certain brands licensed to andor distributed by us 

 

volume in bottler case sales 

 

in addition to sales volume we also measure volume in bottler case sales “volume bcs” as sales of finished beverages in equivalent 288 ounce cases sold by us and our bottlers to retailers and independent distributors 

 

bottler case sales and concentrates and finished beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels which can be affected by seasonality bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions 

recent developments 

 

formation of the company and separation from cadbury 

 

on may 7 2008 cadbury separated its americas beverages business from its global confectionery business by contributing the subsidiaries that operated its americas beverages business to us in return for the transfer of the americas beverages business we distributed our common stock to cadbury plc shareholders as of the date of distribution a total of 800 million shares of our common stock par value 001 per share and 15 million shares of our undesignated preferred stock were authorized on the date of distribution 2537 million shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock were issued on may 7 2008 we became an independent publiclytraded company listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “dps” we entered into a separation and distribution agreement transition services agreement tax sharing and indemnification agreement “tax indemnity agreement” and employee matters agreement with cadbury each dated as of may 1 2008 

 

new financing arrangements 

 

during 2008 we entered into financing arrangements including a 27 billion senior unsecured credit agreement that provides a 22 billion term loan a facility and a 500 million revolving credit facility we completed the issuance of 17 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of 250 million aggregate principal amount of 612 senior notes due 2013 12 billion aggregate principal amount of 682 senior notes due 2018 and 250 million aggregate principal amount of 745 senior notes due 2038 

 

2008 impairment 

 

our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2008 resulted in net noncash impairment charges of 696 million for 2008 1039 million net of tax benefit of 343 million the pretax charges consisted of 278 million related to the snapple brand 581 million related to the bottling group’s distribution rights and 180 million related to the bottling group’s goodwill deteriorating economic and market conditions in the fourth quarter triggered higher discount rates as well as lower volume and growth projections which drove these impairments indicative of the economic and market conditions our average stock price declined 19 in the fourth quarter as compared to the average stock price from may 7 2008 the date of our separation from cadbury through september 30 2008 

 

hansen natural distribution agreement termination 

 

in letters dated october 10 2008 and december 11 2008 we received formal notification from hansen natural corporation “hansen” terminating our agreements to distribute monster energy as well as other hansen’s beverage brands in certain markets in the united states and mexico effective november 10 2008 and january 26 2009 respectively the termination of the hansen distribution agreement in the united states reduced 2008 net sales by 23 million during 2008 our bottling group generated approximately 197 million and 38 million in net sales and operating profits respectively from sales of hansen brands to third parties in the united states and our mexico and the caribbean segment generated approximately 19 million and 6 million in net sales and operating profits respectively from sales of hansen natural brands to third parties in mexico 

 

results of operations 

 

for the periods prior to may 7 2008 our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a “carveout” basis from cadbury’s consolidated financial statements using historical results of operations assets and liabilities attributable to cadbury’s americas beverages business and including allocations of expenses from cadbury the historical cadbury’s americas beverages information is our predecessor financial information we eliminate from our financial results all intercompany transactions between entities included in the combination and the intercompany transactions with our equity method investees on may 7 2008 we became an independent company

consolidated operations 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operation for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

volume 

 

volume bcs declined 2 csds declined 1 and ncbs declined 7 the absence of glaceau brand “glaceau” sales following the termination of the distribution agreement in 2007 negatively impacted total volumes and ncb volumes by 1 percentage point and 7 percentage points respectively in csds dr pepper declined 1 primarily due to continued declines in the “soda fountain classics” line our “core 4” brands which include 7up sunkist aw and canada dry declined 2 primarily related to a 7 decline in 7up as the brand cycled the final stages of launch support for 7up with 100 natural flavors and the relaunch of diet 7up partially offset by a 3 increase in canada dry due to the launch of canada dry green tea ginger ale in ncbs 9 growth in hawaiian punch 6 growth in clamato and 2 growth in mott’s were more than offset by declines of 17 in aguafiel 7 in snapple and the loss of glaceau distribution rights aguafiel declined 17 reflecting price increases and a more competitive environment our snapple volumes were down 7 as the brand overlapped 5 growth in the prior year driven by aggressive promotional activity that we chose not to repeat in 2008 as well as the impact of a weakened retail environment on our premium products in north america volume declined 2 and in mexico and the caribbean volume declined 4 

 

net sales 

 

net sales increased 15 million for 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to price increases and an increase in concentrate sales as bottlers purchased more concentrate in advance of planned concentrate price increases concentrate price increases will be effective in january 2009 compared with concentrate price increases which were made in february 2008 these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales volumes and an increase in discounts paid to customers the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement on november 2 2007 and the hansen distribution agreement in the united states on november 10 2008 reduced 2008 net sales by 227 million and 23 million respectively net sales resulting from the acquisition of seabev in july 2007 added an incremental 61 million to 2008 consolidated net sales 

gross profit 

 

gross profit remained flat for 2008 compared with the prior year increased pricing largely offset the decrease in sales volumes increased customer discounts and increased commodity costs across our segments gross profit for the year ended december 31 2008 includes lifo expense of 20 million compared to 6 million in 2007 lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent goods manufactured are sold first which in periods of rising prices results in an expense that eliminates inflationary profits from net income gross margin was 55 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

loss income from operations 

 

the 1172 million decrease in income from operations for 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily driven by impairment charges of 1039 million in 2008 a one time gain we recognized in 2007 of 71 million in connection with the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement and higher selling general and administrative “sga” expenses in 2008 partially offset by lower restructuring costs 

 

our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2008 resulted in noncash impairment charges of 1039 million for 2008 the pretax charges consisted of 278 million related to the snapple brand 581 related to the bottling group’s distribution rights and 180 million related to the bottling group’s goodwill deteriorating economic and market conditions in the fourth quarter triggered higher discount rates as well as lower volume and growth projections which drove these impairments indicative of the economic and market conditions our average stock price declined 19 in the fourth quarter as compared to the average stock price from may 7 2008 the date of our separation from cadbury through september 30 2008 the impairment of the distribution rights was attributed to insufficient net economic returns above working capital fixed assets and assembled workforce 

 

sga expenses increased for 2008 primarily due to separation related costs higher transportation costs and increased payroll and payroll related costs in connection with our separation from cadbury we incurred transaction costs and other one time costs of 33 million for 2008 we incurred higher transportation costs principally due to an increase of 22 million related to higher fuel prices these increases were partially offset by benefits from restructuring initiatives announced in 2007 lower marketing costs and 12 million in lower stockbased compensation expense 

 

restructuring costs of 57 million and 76 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively were primarily due to a plan announced in october 2007 intended to create a more efficient organization that resulted in the reduction of employees in the company’s corporate sales and supply chain functions and the continued integration of our bottling group into existing businesses restructuring costs for 2007 were higher due to higher costs associated with the organizational restructuring as well as additional costs recognized for the integration of technology facilities and the closure of a facility 

 

the loss of the glaceau distribution agreement reduced 2008 income from operations by 40 million excluding the one time gain from the payment we received on termination 

 

interest expense interest income and other income 

 

interest expense increased 4 million reflecting our capital structure as a standalone company principally relating to our term loan a and unsecured notes interest expense for 2008 contained 26 million related to our bridge loan facility including 21 million of financing fees expensed when the bridge loan facility was terminated in 2008 we incurred 160 million less interest expense related to debt owed to cadbury and 19 million related to third party debt settlement 

 

the 32 million decrease in interest income was primarily due to the loss of interest income earned on note receivable balances with subsidiaries of cadbury partially offset as we earned interest income on the funds from the bridge loan facility and other cash balances 

 

other income of 18 million in 2008 primarily related to indemnity income associated with the tax indemnity agreement with cadbury 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 163 and 394 respectively the 2008 tax rate reflects that the tax benefit provided on the 2008 impairment charge is at an effective rate lower than our statutory rate primarily 

due to limits on the tax benefit provided against goodwill the 2008 tax benefit also reflects expense of 19 million related to items cadbury is obligated to indemnify us for under the tax indemnity agreement as well as additional tax expense of 16 million driven by separation transactions 

 

results of operations by segment

the following table details our beverage concentrates segment’s net sales and uop for 2008 and 2007 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

net sales for 2008 increased 12 million compared with 2007 primarily due to price increases and a favorable timing change of concentrate sales as bottlers purchased more concentrate in advance of planned concentrate price increases concentrate price increases will be effective in january 2009 compared with price increases which were effective in february 2008 these increases were partially offset by a decline in volumes and an increase in fountain food service channel discounts volumes declined 1 primarily resulting from lower intersegment sales partially offset by a 1 increase in fountain food service sales volumes and additional volumes gains due to the change in timing of concentrate prices 

 

uop increased 47 million for 2008 as compared with 2007 driven by lower personnel costs primarily due to savings generated from restructuring initiatives lower marketing costs and the increase in net sales 

 

volume bcs declined 2 in 2008 dr pepper declined 1 driven primarily by continued declines in the “soda fountain classics” line the “core 4” brands which include 7up sunkist aw and canada dry decreased 2 driven primarily by 7up as the brand cycled the final stages of launch support for 7up with 100 natural flavors and the relaunch of diet 7up partially offset by a 3 increase in canada dry resulting from the launch of canada dry green tea 

finished goods 

 

the following table details our finished goods segment’s net sales and uop for 2008 and 2007 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

net sales increased 62 million for 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 2 increase in sales volumes and price increases the increase in sales volumes was led by hawaiian punch with growth of 18 recently launched products including venom energy and aw and sunkist readytodrink floats as well as growth of 2 and 1 in clamato and mott’s respectively snapple sales volumes decreased by 10 as we chose not to repeat aggressive promotional activity used in 2007 and from the impact of a weakened retail environment on our premium products the increase in prices was primarily driven by our mott’s brand 

 

uop increased 24 million for 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the growth in net sales combined with lower marketing costs as we cycled the introduction of accelerade and savings generated from restructuring initiatives these increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs and higher distribution costs 

 

bottling group 

 

the following table details our bottling group segment’s net sales and uop for 2008 and 2007 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

net sales decreased 41 million in 2008 compared with 2007 reflecting price increases offset by a 1 volume decline the sales volume decline was driven by the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement on november 2 2007 and the hansen distribution agreement on november 10 2008 the termination of the glaceau and hansen agreements reduced 2008 net sales by 227 million and 23 million respectively a decline in external sales was partially offset by an increase of 10 in intersegment sales as we increased bottling group’s manufacturing of company owned brands seabev which was acquired in july 2007 added an incremental 82 million to our net sales in 2008 

 

uop decreased by 112 million primarily due to declines in net sales combined with higher commodity and component costs higher distribution costs and increased wage and benefit costs the termination of the glaceau agreement reduced uop by 40 million excluding a one time gain of 13 million from the payment we received on termination the termination of the hansen agreement reduced uop by 3 million 

 

during 2008 our bottling group generated approximately 197 million and 38 million in net sales and operating profits respectively from sales of hansen brands to third parties in the united states 

mexico and the caribbean 

 

the following table details our mexico and the caribbean segment’s net sales and uop for 2008 and 2007 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

net sales increased 9 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to price increases and a favorable channel and product mix partially offset by a decline in volumes sales volumes decreased 4 principally driven by the performance of aguafiel and peñafiel due to aggressive price competition 

 

uop decreased 14 million in 2008 due to an increase in raw material costs combined with higher distribution and wage costs and volume declines partially offset by the increase in net sales and lower marketing costs raw material costs were negatively affected both by higher costs of packaging materials and the mexican peso devaluation in the fourth quarter of 2008 an increase in distribution costs and wages resulted from additional distribution routes added during the year 

 

in a letter dated december 11 2008 we received formal notification from hansen natural corporation terminating our agreements to distribute monster energy in mexico effective january 26 2009 during 2008 our mexico and the caribbean segment generated approximately 19 million and 6 million in net sales and operating profits respectively from sales of hansen natural brands to third parties in mexico 

 

accounting for the separation from cadbury 

 

upon separation effective may 7 2008 we became an independent company which established a new consolidated reporting structure for the periods prior to may 7 2008 our consolidated financial information has been prepared on a “carveout” basis from cadbury’s consolidated financial statements using the historical results of operations assets and liabilities attributable to cadbury’s americas beverages business and including allocations of expenses from cadbury the results may not be indicative of our future performance and may not reflect our financial performance had we been an independent publiclytraded company during those prior periods

the consolidated financial statements present the taxes of our stand alone business and contain certain taxes transferred to us at separation in accordance with the tax indemnity agreement agreed between us and cadbury this agreement provides for the transfer to us of taxes related to an entity that was part of cadbury’s confectionery business and therefore not part of our historical consolidated financial statements the consolidated financial statements also reflect that the tax indemnity agreement requires cadbury to indemnify us for these taxes these taxes and the associated indemnity may change over time as estimates of the amounts change changes in estimates will be reflected when facts change and those changes in estimate will be reflected in our statement of operations at the time of the estimate change in addition pursuant to the terms of the tax indemnity agreement if we breach certain covenants or other obligations or we are involved in certain changeincontrol transactions cadbury may not be required to indemnify us for any of these unrecognized tax benefits that are subsequently realized

results of operations for 2007 compared to 2006 

 

combined operations 

 

the following table sets forth our combined results of operation for 2007 and 2006 in millions 

 

 

 

volume 

 

volume bcs increased 1 an 8 increase in ncbs was partially offset by a 1 decline in csds in csds dr pepper declined 2 driven by declines in the “soda fountain classics” line extensions which were introduced nationally in 2005 our “core 4” brands which include 7up sunkist aw and canada dry increased 1 consistent with the consumer shift from colas to flavored csds sales of glaceau products had a 5 favorable impact on ncb growth additionally in ncbs growth of 4 10 32 and 3 in snapple mott’s aguafiel and clamato respectively was partially offset by a 13 decrease in hawaiian punch our snapple volumes increase was driven by aggressive promotional activity and pricing activity in 2007 volumes increased 1 in both north america and in mexico and the caribbean 

 

net sales 

 

net sales increased 995 million for 2007 compared with 2006 driven by increases in our bottling group segment which contributed an additional 931 million mainly due to the inclusion of our bottling acquisitions higher pricing and improved sales mix in all remaining segments increased net sales by 3 despite lower volumes 

the disposal of the grandma’s molasses brand in january 2006 and the slush puppie business in may 2006 reduced net sales by less than 1 

 

gross profit 

 

the 390 million increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in our bottling group segment which contributed an additional 359 million mainly due to the inclusion of our bottling acquisitions the remaining increase was primarily due to net sales growth across our remaining segments partially offset by increases in commodity costs including sweeteners and apple juice concentrate as well as inventory writeoffs related to accelerade 

 

the decrease in gross margin from 58 in 2006 to 55 in 2007 was due primarily to the inclusion of our bottling acquisitions for the full year 2007 as compared to partial periods in 2006 as bottling operations generally have lower margins than our other businesses 

 

income from operations 

 

income from operations decreased 14 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily driven by an increase in sga expenses higher restructuring charges an increase in depreciation and amortization and a 6 million impairment charge partially offset by the increase in gross profit and gains recorded as the result of the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement 

 

sga expense increased primarily due to the inclusion of our bottling acquisitions wage and benefit inflation higher transportation costs as well as higher operating expense allocations from cadbury partially offset by a reduction in annual management incentive plan accruals marketing expenses was up slightly in 2007 to support new product launches including accelerade mott’s line extensions and peñafiel in the united states higher depreciation on property plant and equipment and an increase in amortization of definitelived intangibles was also related to our bottling acquisitions in 2007 we recorded impairment charges of 6 million of which 4 million was related to the accelerade brand 

 

restructuring costs for 2007 were primarily due to a plan announced in october 2007 intended to create a more efficient organization that resulted in the reduction of employees in the company’s corporate sales and supply chain functions and the continued integration of our bottling group into existing businesses the restructuring costs in 2006 were primarily related to the integration of our bottling group into existing businesses as well as various other cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to align management information systems consolidate back office operations from acquired businesses eliminate duplicate functions and relocate employees 

 

income from operations in 2007 included an incremental 39 million of onetime gains as we recognized a 71 million gain upon the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement in 2007 as compared to a 32 million gain on disposals of the grandma’s molasses brand and the slush puppie business in 2006 

 

interest expense and interest income 

 

interest expense decreased 4 million in 2007 primarily due to a reduction in interest paid on a lawsuit settled in june 2007 and the settlement of third party debt partially offset by an increase in interest paid to cadbury 

 

the 18 million increase in interest income was primarily due to higher note receivable balances with subsidiaries of cadbury 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were 394 and 370 respectively the increase in the effective rate for 2007 was primarily due to a lower benefit from foreign operations

beverage concentrates 

 

the following table details our beverage concentrates segment’s net sales and uop for 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

net sales increased 12 million primarily due to price increases which more than offset the impact of a 1 volume decline the volume decline was due primarily to a 3 decline in dr pepper partially offset by single digit percentage increases in sunkist schweppes and aw the dr pepper decline was primarily a result of the launch of “soda fountain classics” line line extensions are usually offered for a limited time period and their volumes typically decline in the years subsequent to the year of launch as was the case with the “soda fountain classics” line in 2007 for 2006 net sales included 8 million for the slush puppie business which was disposed of in may 2006 

 

uop increased 21 million primarily due to higher net sales and lower marketing expenses particularly advertising costs partially offset by increased sweetener and flavor costs and increased selling general and administrative expenses the lower marketing expenses were primarily a result of a reduction in costs to support new product initiatives including 25 million for the launch of accelerade selling general and administrative expenses were higher due primarily to increased corporate costs following our bottler acquisitions a sales reorganization and general inflationary increases which were partially offset by lower management annual incentive plan accruals 

volume bcs declined 2 in 2007 due primarily to a 3 decline in dr pepper and a single and double digit percentage decline in 7up and diet rite respectively the dr pepper decline results from comparisons to strong volumes in 2006 driven by the “soda fountain classics” line which was introduced nationally in 2005 the 7up decline primarily reflects the discontinuance of 7up plus as well as the comparison to strong volumes in 2006 driven by the third quarter launch of 7up “with natural flavors” and heavy promotional support for 7up and other brands the diet rite decline was due to the shift of marketing investment from diet rite to other diet brands such as diet sunkist diet aw and diet canada dry these declines were partially offset by single digit percentage increases in sunkist and canada dry which are consistent with the consumer shift from colas to flavored csds 

 

finished goods 

 

the following table details our finished goods segment’s net sales and uop for 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

net sales increased 46 million for 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to price increases and a favorable shift towards higher priced products such as snapple and mott’s these increases were partially offset by a 2 decrease in sales volumes and higher product placement costs associated with new product launches the decrease in volumes primarily resulted from a decrease in hawaiian punch volumes due to a price increase in april 2007 which more than offset growth from snapple and mott’s snapple volumes increased primarily due to the launch of antioxidant waters and the continued growth from super premium teas mott’s volumes increased due primarily to the new product launches of mott’s for tots juice and mott’s scooby doo apple sauce and increased consumer demand for apple juice 

 

uop decreased 7 million in 2007 due primarily to a 55 million operating loss from accelerade partially offset by the strong performance of mott’s and snapple products the 55 million operating loss attributable to accelerade was primarily due to new product launch expenses such as significant product placement and marketing investments in 2007 we had no net sales for accelerade as gross sales were more than offset by product placement fees uop was also negatively impacted by higher packaging and commodity costs as well as the launches of mott’s line extensions and peñafiel in the united states these decreases in uop were partially offset by the elimination of copacking fees previously charged by the bottling group segment and lower sga expenses in connection with a sales reorganization 

 

bottling group 

 

the following table details our bottling group segment’s net sales and uop for 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

the results of operations for 2006 only include eight months of results from dpsubg which was acquired in may 2006 approximately seven months of results from all american bottling corp which was acquired in june 2006 and approximately five months of results from seven up bottling company of san francisco which was acquired in august 2006 2007 includes a full year of results of operations for these businesses and approximately six months of results from seabev which was acquired in july 2007 

 

net sales increased 1142 million for 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the bottling acquisitions described above price increases and a favorable sales mix of higher priced ncbs 

uop increased 2 million in 2007 compared with 2006 in 2007 uop included 13 million of the 71 million gain from the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement the associated profit from the increased net sales were more than offset by an increase in postacquisition employee benefit costs wage inflation costs higher sweetener costs the elimination of copacking fees in 2007 which were previously earned on manufacturing for the finished goods segment and an increase in investments in new markets 

 

mexico and the caribbean 

 

the following table details our mexico and caribbean segment’s net sales and uop for 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

net sales increased 10 million for 2007 compared with 2006 due to volume growth of 2 and increased pricing despite challenging market conditions and adverse weather the volume growth was due to double digit percentage increases in aguafiel and clamato foreign currency translation negatively impacted net sales by 6 million 

 

uop decreased 2 million in 2007 despite the increase in net sales primarily due to an increase in raw material costs particularly sweeteners and higher distribution costs 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity 

 

recent global financial events have resulted in the consolidation failure or near failure of a number of institutions in the banking insurance and investment banking industries and have substantially reduced the ability of companies to obtain financing we have assessed the implications of the recent financial events on our current business and determined that these market disruptions have not had a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity as of december 31 2008 however there can be no assurance that these events will not have an impact on our future financial position results of operations or liquidity as these events could have a number of different effects on our business including 

 

  

we believe that the following recent transactions and trends and uncertainties may impact liquidity

we are required to pay annual amortization in equal quarterly installments on the aggregate principal amount of the term loan a equal to i 10  or 220 million per year for installments due in the first and second years following the initial date of funding ii 15 or 330 million per year for installments due in the third and fourth years following the initial date of funding and iii 50 or 11 billion for installments due in the fifth year following the initial date of funding because of prepayments made during 2008 we have no required principal payments due in 2009 

 

the revolving credit facility has an aggregate principal amount of 500 million with a maturity in 2013 the revolving credit facility was undrawn as of december 31 2008 except to the extent utilized by letters of credit up to 75 million of the revolving credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit of which 38 million was utilized as of december 31 2008 principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due and payable in full at maturity we may use borrowings under the revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes 

 

the senior unsecured credit facility requires us to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio covenant and a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant as defined in the credit agreement the senior unsecured credit facility also contains certain usual and customary representations and warranties affirmative covenants and events of default as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all covenant requirements based on our current and anticipated level of operations we expect to be in compliance with all covenant requirements in the near and long term 

 

senior unsecured notes 

 

we completed the issuance of 17 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of 250 million aggregate principal amount of 612 senior notes due 2013 12 billion aggregate principal amount of 682 senior notes due 2018 and 250 million aggregate principal amount of 745 senior notes due 2038 the weighted average interest cost of the senior unsecured notes is 68 interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 and is subject to adjustment as defined 

 

the indenture governing the notes among other things limits our ability to incur indebtedness secured by principal properties to incur certain sale and lease back transactions and to enter into certain mergers or transfers of 

substantially all of our assets the notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 

 

use of proceeds 

 

we used the funds from the term loan a facility and the net proceeds of the senior unsecured notes to settle with cadbury related party debt and other balances eliminate cadbury’s net investment in us purchase certain assets from cadbury related to our business and pay fees and expenses related to our credit facilities 

 

debt ratings 

 

as of december 31 2008 our debt ratings were baa3 with a stable outlook from moody’s investor service and bbbwith a negative outlook from standard  poor’s these debt ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangement a downgrade of one or both of our debt ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations 

 

cash management 

 

prior to separation our cash was available for use and was regularly swept by cadbury operations in the united states at its discretion cadbury also funded our operating and investing activities as needed we earned interest income on certain related party balances our interest income has been reduced due to the settlement of the related party balances upon separation and accordingly we expect interest income for 2009 to be minimal 

 

post separation we fund our liquidity needs from cash flow from operations and amounts available under financing arrangements 

 

capital expenditures 

 

capital expenditures were 304 million 230 million and 158 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively capital expenditures for all periods primarily consisted of expansion of our capabilities in existing facilities cold drink equipment and it investments for new systems the increase in expenditures for 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily related to early stage costs of a new manufacturing and distribution center in victorville california the increase in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to investments and improvements in newly acquired bottling operations we continue to expect to incur discretionary annual capital expenditures in an amount equal to approximately 5 of our net sales which we expect to fund through cash provided by operating activities 

 

restructuring 

 

we have implemented restructuring programs from time to time and have incurred costs that are designed to improve operating effectiveness and lower costs these programs have included closure of manufacturing plants reductions in force integration of back office operations and outsourcing of certain transactional activities we recorded 57 million 76 million and 27 of restructuring costs for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and we do not expect to incur significant restructuring charges over the next 12 months refer to note 14 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

acquisitions 

 

we may make further acquisitions for example we may make further acquisitions of regional bottling companies distributors and distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage any acquisitions may require future capital expenditures and restructuring expenses 

 

liquidity 

 

based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs we may utilize amounts available under our revolving credit facility 

the following table summarizes our cash activity for 2008 2007 and 2006 in millions 

 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 106 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared with the year ended december 31 2007 the 809 million decrease in net income included a 1033 million increase in the noncash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets an 83 million decrease in the gain on the disposal of assets due to a onetime gain recorded in 2007 upon the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement an increase of 39 million in depreciation and amortization expense driven by higher capital expenditures and the amortization of capitalized financing costs and the impact of the writeoff of 21 million of deferred financing costs related to our bridge loan facility these amounts were partially offset by a decrease of 296 million in deferred income taxes driven by the impairment of intangible assets changes in working capital included a 71 million favorable decrease in inventory primarily due to improved inventory management and lower sales volumes offset by an increase of 43 million in trade accounts receivable and a 43 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses trade accounts receivable increased despite reduced collection times due to an increase in sales in december 2008 accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased primarily due to lower inventory purchases as we focus on inventory management cash provided by operations was also impacted by our separation from cadbury 

 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was 603 million compared to 581 million in 2006 the 22 million increase was primarily due to changes in noncash adjustments and working capital improvements the increase in working capital was primarily the result of a 99 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a 74 million decrease in trade accounts receivable these changes were partially offset by increases in related party receivables of 55 million other accounts receivable of 84 million and inventories of 27 million 

 

net cash provided by investing activities 

 

the increase of 2161 million in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 compared with the year ended december 31 2007 was primarily attributable to related party notes receivable due to the separation from cadbury for the 2007 cash used in net issuances of related party notes receivable totaled 929 million compared with cash provided by net repayments of related party notes receivable of 1375 million for 2008 we increased capital expenditures by 74 million in the current year primarily due to early stage costs of a new manufacturing and distribution center in victorville california capital asset investments for both years primarily consisted of expansion of our capabilities in existing facilities replacement of existing cold drink equipment it investments for new systems and upgrades to the vehicle fleet additionally cash used by investing activities for 2007 included 98 million in proceeds from the disposal of assets primarily attributable to the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement partially offset by net cash used in the acquisition of seabev 

 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 1087 million compared to 502 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase of 585 million was primarily attributable to the issuance of notes receivable for 1846 million partially offset by 842 million due to the repayment of notes receivable and a decrease of 405 million for acquisitions principally the acquisition in 2006 of the remaining 55 interest in dpsubg additionally cash used by investing activities for 2007 included 98 million in proceeds from the disposal of assets primarily attributable to the termination of the glaceau distribution agreement partially offset by net cash used in the acquisition of seabev 

 

net cash provided by financing activities 

 

the increase of 2140 million in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 compared with the year ended december 31 2007 was driven by the change in cadbury’s investment as part of our 

separation from cadbury and payments of third party longterm debt this increase was partially offset by the issuances of third party longterm debt 

 

the following table summarizes the issuances and payments of third party and related party debt for 2008 and 2007 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 515 million compared to 72 million used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 the 587 million increase in 2007 was due to higher levels of debt issuances and net investment transactions with cadbury partially offset by increases in debt repayment 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

 

cash and cash equivalents were 214 million as of december 31 2008 an increase of 147 million from 67 million as of december 31 2007 the increase was primarily due to our separation from cadbury as prior to separation our excess cash was regularly swept by cadbury 

 

our cash balances are used to fund working capital requirements scheduled debt and interest payments capital expenditures and income tax obligations cash available in our foreign operations may not be immediately available for these purposes foreign cash balances constitute approximately 32 of our total cash position as of december 31 2008 

 

contractual commitments and obligations 

 

we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies at december 31 2008 in millions based on our current and anticipated level of operations we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 

we may utilize amounts available under our revolving credit facility refer to notes 11 and 15 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the items described in this table 

 

 

 

 

  

in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement 109  we had 515 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2008 classified as a longterm liability the table above does not reflect any payments related to tax reserves if it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

there are no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult subjective or complex estimates and assessments these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary actual amounts may differ from these estimates and judgments we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting estimates see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred 1 delivery 2 persuasive evidence of an agreement exists 3 pricing is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the customer and us the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on contract terms for sales to customers that are designated in the contract as freeonboard destination revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to and accepted at the customer’s delivery site net sales are reported net of costs associated with customer marketing programs and incentives as described below as well as sales taxes and other similar taxes 

 

customer marketing programs and incentives 

 

we offer a variety of incentives and discounts to bottlers customers and consumers through various programs to support the distribution of our products these incentives and discounts include cash discounts price allowances volume based rebates product placement fees and other financial support for items such as trade promotions displays new products consumer incentives and advertising assistance these incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales the aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately 3057 million 3159 million and 2440 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively trade spend for 2008 and 2007 reflect a full year of trade spend costs from our bottling group while 2006 includes the effect of our bottling group’s trade spend only from the date of the acquisition of the remaining 55 of dpsubg the amounts of trade spend are larger in our bottling group than those related to other parts of our business our customer incentive programs are generally based on annual targets accruals are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms volumebased metrics andor historical trends and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels 

 

goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 

 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  “sfas 142” we classify intangible assets into three categories 1 intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization 2 intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and 3 goodwill the majority of our intangible asset balance is made up of brands which we have determined to have indefinite useful lives in arriving at the conclusion that a brand has an indefinite useful life management reviews factors such as size diversification and market share of each brand management expects to acquire hold and support brands for an indefinite period through consumer marketing and promotional support we also consider factors such as our ability to continue to protect the legal rights that arise from these brand names indefinitely or the absence of any regulatory economic or competitive factors that could truncate the life of the brand name if the criteria are not met to assign an indefinite life the brand is amortized over its expected useful life 

 

we conduct tests for impairment in accordance with sfas 142 for intangible assets with definite lives we conduct tests for impairment if conditions indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives we conduct tests for impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination and also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units we define reporting units as our business segments our equity method investees also perform such tests for impairment for intangible assets andor goodwill if an impairment charge was recorded by our equity method investee we would record our proportionate share of such charge 

 

the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is recorded the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible 

asset impairment charges “step 1” if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is indicated and a second step analysis must be performed 

 

the tests for impairment include significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets primarily by analyzing future revenues and profit performance fair value is based on what the intangible asset would be worth to a third party market participant discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt adjusted with various risk premiums these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various of the risks discussed in “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

 

our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2008 resulted in noncash charges of 1039 million for 2008 which are reported in the line item impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in our consolidated statement of operations a summary of the impairment charges is provided below in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

for our annual impairment analysis performed as of december 31 2008 methodologies used to determine the fair values of the assets included a combination of the income based approach and market based approach as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and our enterprise value 

 

the results of the step 1 analyses performed as of december 31 2008 indicated there was a potential impairment of goodwill in the bottling group reporting unit as the book value exceeded the estimated fair value as a result the second step “step 2” of the goodwill impairment test was performed for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill determined in the step 2 analysis was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the applicable reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and related deferred taxes as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as a result of the step 2 analysis we impaired the entire bottling group goodwill 

 

the following table summarizes the critical assumptions that were used in estimating fair value for our annual impairment tests performed as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

 46 

 

  

for the bottling group goodwill keeping the residual operating income growth rate constant but changing the discount rate downward by 050 would indicate less of an impairment charge of approximately 60 million keeping the discount rate constant and increasing the residual operating income growth rate by 050 would indicate less of an impairment charge of approximately 10 million an increase of 050 in the estimated operating income growth rate would reduce the goodwill impairment charge by approximately 75 million 

 

for the snapple brand keeping the residual operating income growth rate constant but changing the discount rate by 050 would result in a 45 million to 50 million change in the impairment charge keeping the discount rate constant but changing the residual operating income growth rate by 050 would result in a 30 million to 35 million change in the impairment charge of the snapple brand a change of 025 in the estimated operating income growth rate would change the impairment charge by approximately 25 million 

 

a change in the critical assumptions detailed above would not result in a change to the impairment charge related to distribution rights 

 

the results of our annual impairment tests indicated that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill not discussed above exceeded their carrying values and therefore are not impaired 

 

based on triggering events in the second and third quarters of 2008 we performed interim impairment analyses of the snapple brand and the bottling group goodwill and concluded there was no impairment as of june 30 and september 30 2008 respectively however deteriorating economic and market conditions in the fourth quarter triggered higher discount rates as well as lower volume and growth projections which drove the impairments of the bottling group goodwill snapple brand and the bottling group’s distribution rights recorded in the fourth quarter indicative of the economic and market conditions our average stock price declined 19 in the fourth quarter as compared to the average stock price from may 7 2008 the date of our separation from cadbury through september 30 2008 the impairment of the distribution rights was attributed to insufficient net economic returns above working capital fixed assets and assembled workforce 

 

in 2007 we recorded impairment charges of 6 million of which 4 million was related to the accelerade brand 

 

definite lived intangible assets 

 

definite lived intangible assets are those assets deemed by the management to have determinable finite useful lives identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives as follows 

 

 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for our stockbased compensation plans under sfas no 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” sfas 123r requires the recognition of compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations related to the fair value of employee sharebased awards determining the amount of expense for stockbased compensation as well as the associated impact to our balance sheets and statements of cash flows requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stockbased compensation expense the most significant factors of that expense that require estimates or projections include the expected volatility expected lives and estimated forfeiture rates of stockbased awards as we lack a meaningful set of historical data upon which to develop valuation assumptions we have elected to develop certain valuation assumptions based on information disclosed by 

similarlysituated companies including multinational consumer goods companies of similar market capitalization and large food and beverage industry companies which have experienced an initial public offering since june 2001 

 

in accordance with sfas 123r we recognize the cost of all unvested employee stock options on a straightline attribution basis over their respective vesting periods net of estimated forfeitures prior to our separation from cadbury we participated in certain employee share plans that contained inflation indexed earnings growth performance conditions these plans were accounted for under the liability method of sfas 123r in accordance with sfas 123r a liability was recorded on the balance sheet until and in calculating the income statement charge for share awards the fair value of each award was remeasured at each reporting date until awards vested we no longer participate in employee share plans that contain inflation indexed earnings growth performance conditions 

 

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

we have several pension and postretirement plans covering employees who satisfy age and length of service requirements there are twelve standalone noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and six standalone postretirement plans depending on the plan pension and postretirement benefits are based on a combination of factors which may include salary age and years of service 

 

pension expense has been determined in accordance with the principles of sfas no 87  employers’ accounting for pensions as amended by sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of financial accounting standards board statements no 87 88 106 and 132r “sfas 158” our policy is to fund pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions employee demographic data years of service compensation benefits and claims paid and employer contributions 

 

the expense related to the postretirement plans has been determined in accordance with sfas no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions “sfas 106” as amended by sfas no 158 as stated in sfas 106 we accrue the cost of these benefits during the years that employees render service to us 

 

the calculation of pension and postretirement plan obligations and related expenses is dependent on several assumptions used to estimate the present value of the benefits earned while the employee is eligible to participate in the plans the key assumptions we use in determining the plan obligations and related expenses include 1 the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities 2 employee turnover retirement age and mortality and 3 the expected return on plan assets our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance due to the significant judgment required our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and postretirement obligations and expenses refer to note 15 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

the effect of a 1 increase or decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the pension benefit obligations for us plans would change the benefit obligation as of december 31 2008 by approximately 26 million and 29 million respectively the effect of a 1 change in the weightedaverage assumptions used to determine the net periodic costs would change the costs for the year ended december 31 2008 by approximately 3 million 

 

risk management programs 

 

we retain selected levels of property casualty workers’ compensation and other business risks many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or selfinsured retentions accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends these loss development factors are established in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries at december 31 2008 we had accrued liabilities related to the retained risks of 60 million including both current and longterm liabilities at december 31 2007 we had accrued liabilities of 49 million primarily related to retained risks to cover longterm 

selfinsured liabilities for our bottling group prior to participation in the cadbury placed insurance programs prior to our separation from cadbury we participated in insurance programs placed by cadbury prior to and upon separation cadbury retained the risk and accrued liabilities for the exposures insured under these insurance programs 

 

we believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our selfinsured liabilities however the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known the final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents medical cost inflation legislative actions uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control 

 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are computed and reported on a separate return basis and accounted for using the asset and liability approach under sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes “sfas 109” this method involves determining the temporary differences between combined assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and the corresponding combined amounts recognized for tax purposes and computing the taxrelated carryforwards at the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the resulting amounts are deferred tax assets or liabilities and the net changes represent the deferred tax expense or benefit for the year the total of taxes currently payable per the tax return and the deferred tax expense or benefit represents the income tax expense or benefit for the year for financial reporting purposes 

 

we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings our estimate of current and expected future earnings prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and current and future ownership changes 

 

as of december 31 2008 undistributed earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in nonus subsidiaries totaled approximately 124 million deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income as the company believes these earnings to be permanently reinvested it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on these undistributed foreign earnings 

 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to various factors including but not limited to total earnings and the mix of earnings by jurisdiction the timing of changes in tax laws and the amount of tax provided for uncertain tax positions

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including inflation movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices 

 

foreign exchange risk 

 

the majority of our net sales expenses and capital purchases are transacted in united states dollars however we do have some exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2008 the impact to net income of a 10 change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately 17 million 

interest rate risk 

 

we centrally manage our debt portfolio and monitor our mix of fixedrate and variable rate debt 

 

we are subject to floating interest rate risk with respect to our longterm debt under the credit facilities the principal interest rate exposure relates to amounts borrowed under our term loan a facility we incurred 22 billion of debt with floating interest rates under this facility a change in the estimated interest rate on the outstanding 18 billion of borrowings under the term loan a facility up or down by 1 will increase or decrease our earnings before provision for income taxes by approximately 18 million respectively on an annual basis we will also have interest rate exposure for any amounts we may borrow in the future under the revolving credit facility 

 

we utilize interest rate swaps to convert variable interest rates to fixed rates in order to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates the swaps were effective as of september 30 2008 the notional amount of the swaps is 500 million and 1200 million with a duration of six months and 15 months respectively and convert variable interest rates to fixed rates of 48075 and 527125 respectively in february of 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap effective december 31 2009 with a duration of 12 months the notional amount of the swap amortizes over the term of the swap from 750 million to 450 million and converts variable interest rates to fixed rates of 373 

 

commodity risks 

 

we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of aluminum corn for high fructose corn syrup natural gas for use in processing and packaging pet and fuel 

 

we utilize commodities forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities the fair market value of these contracts as of december 31 2008 was a liability of 8 million 

 

as of december 31 2008 the impact to net income of a 10 change in market prices of these commodities is estimated to be approximately 28 million
