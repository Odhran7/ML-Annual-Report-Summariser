competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses private equity firms and online lending companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

we describe below and in note 28 regulatory capital requirements and other restrictions to financial statements included in the 2021 annual report to shareholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as nonus governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies bhcs is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services make acquisitions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a 

result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections in the 2021 annual report to shareholders for additional information 

general 

parent bank holding company as a bhc the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by its primary regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company with securities listed on the new york stock exchange nyse the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies

parent bank holding company activities 

“financial in nature” requirement we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bhc for purposes of various frb regulations as a bhc that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company other than a bhc bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company 

to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bhc bank or savings association in addition the frb has implemented a final rule under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act that also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bhcs banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act cra performance is also taken into account by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches in addition if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bhc may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bhc not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines subject to the same deposit limits noted above thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

  

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital requirements for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 28 regulatory capital requirements and other restrictions to financial statements included in the 2021 annual report to shareholders 

furthermore under a support agreement dated june 28 2017 as amended and restated on june 26 2019 the “support agreement” among the parent wfc holdings llc an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the parent the “ihc” wells fargo bank na wells fargo securities llc wells fargo clearing services llc and certain other subsidiaries of the parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan the ihc may be restricted from making dividend payments to the parent if certain liquidity andor capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the us bankruptcy code any such restriction could materially and adversely impact the parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations as well as its ability to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2021 annual report to shareholders for additional information on the support agreement 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb requires large bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans describing planned capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the frb also finalized rules implementing in the united states the basel committee on banking supervision’s regulatory capital rules including the reforms known as basel iii which established various capital requirements for us banking organizations moreover federal banking regulators have finalized rules that require leverage and supplementary leverage ratio requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those us banking organizations such as the company that are designated as global systemically important banks gsibs the failure to meet any of these requirements could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions 

in addition the frb’s enhanced supervision regulations for large bhcs like wells fargo impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers for more information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries see the “capital management” “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2021 annual report to shareholders 

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks   the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms the company is also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers directors and principal shareholders of the parent and its subsidiary banks 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

  

depositor preference   in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors including the parent and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

  

liability of commonly controlled institutions   the company’s subsidiaries include banks in the us such as wells fargo bank na that are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bhc and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bhc “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act and the numerous rules to implement its provisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision of large bhcs such as wells fargo this includes among other things rules to promote financial stability and prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or 

failure of a large bhc enhance consumer protections prohibit proprietary trading and implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs regarding riskbased capital and leverage risk and liquidity management stress testing and recovery and resolution planning the doddfrank act including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules has affected and we expect will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity for more information about the doddfrank act and its effect on our business see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2021 annual report to shareholders 

capital and liquidity requirements and capital planning 

the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by federal banking regulators the capital rules among other things establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures federal banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a leverage and supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions and to implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio the frb has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured longterm debt a gsib must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 

from time to time federal banking regulators propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital requirements and related reporting instructions in addition the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal banking regulators to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management federal banking regulators are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

in addition the frb’s capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases by certain bhcs including wells fargo federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions 

for more information on our capital requirements and planning see the “capital management” section of the 2021 annual report to shareholders 

deposit insurance assessments 

the company’s subsidiaries include banks such as wells fargo bank na that are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our insured banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the dif through assessments on member banks to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate 

the fdic has adopted a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management targeting a designated reserve ratio of 2 for the year ended december 31 2021 the companys fdic deposit insurance assessments totaled 666 million 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution or its directors have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or have violated any applicable law regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

  

fiscal and monetary policies 

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on affiliate marketing 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires the implementation of policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

future legislation or regulation 

economic market and political conditions during the past several years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the us and abroad affecting the financial services industry as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses private equity firms and online lending companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of 

depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

we describe below and in note 28 regulatory capital requirements and other restrictions to financial statements included in the 2020 annual report to shareholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as nonus governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies bhcs is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services make acquisitions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections in the 2020 annual report to shareholders for additional information 

  

general 

parent bank holding company as a bhc the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by its primary regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company with securities listed on the new york stock exchange nyse the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies 

  

subsidiary banks   our subsidiary national banks and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and also by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic the frb the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the sec and the commodities futures trading commission cftc the nonus branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective financial regulators as well as by the occ and the frb nonus subsidiaries of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business 

  

nonbank subsidiaries many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies as well as the frb our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra and in some cases the cftc and the municipal securities rulemaking board and state securities regulators our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states as well as nonus countries in which they conduct business 

parent bank holding company activities 

“financial in nature” requirement we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bhc for purposes of other frb regulations as a bhc that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company other than a bhc bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bhc bank or savings association in addition the frb has implemented a final rule under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act that also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bhcs banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act cra performance is also taken into account by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches in addition if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bhc may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bhc not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless 

the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines subject to the same deposit limits noted above thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

  

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

  

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital requirements for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 28 regulatory capital requirements and other restrictions to financial statements included in the 2020 annual report to shareholders 

furthermore under a support agreement dated june 28 2017 as amended and restated on june 26 2019 the “support agreement” among the parent wfc holdings llc an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the parent the “ihc” wells fargo bank na wells fargo securities llc wells fargo clearing services llc and certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the parent designated as material entities for resolution planning purposes or identified as related support entities in our resolution plan the ihc may be restricted from making dividend payments to the parent if certain liquidity andor capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the us bankruptcy code any such restriction could materially and adversely impact the parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations as well as its ability to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2020 annual report to shareholders for additional information on the support agreement 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb requires large bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans describing planned capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the frb also finalized rules implementing in the 

united states the basel committee on banking supervision’s regulatory capital rules including the reforms known as basel iii which established various capital requirements for us banking organizations moreover federal banking regulators have finalized rules that require leverage and supplementary leverage ratio requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those us banking organizations such as the company that are designated as global systemically important banks gsibs the failure to meet any of these requirements could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions 

in addition the frb’s enhanced supervision regulations for large bhcs like wells fargo impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers for more information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries see the “capital management” “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2020 annual report to shareholders 

  

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks   the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms the company is also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers directors and principal shareholders of the parent and its subsidiary banks 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

  

depositor preference   in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors 

including the parent and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

  

liability of commonly controlled institutions   all of the company’s subsidiary banks in the us are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bhc and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bhc “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

  

doddfrank act   

the doddfrank act and the numerous rules to implement its provisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision of large bhcs such as wells fargo this includes among other things rules to promote financial stability and prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bhc enhance consumer protections prohibit proprietary trading and implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs regarding riskbased capital and leverage risk and liquidity management stress testing and recovery and resolution planning the doddfrank act including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules has affected and we expect will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity for more information about the doddfrank act and its effect on our business see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2020 annual report to shareholders 

    

capital and liquidity requirements and capital planning 

the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by federal banking regulators the capital rules among other things establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures federal banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a leverage and supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions and to implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio the frb has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured longterm debt a gsib must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 

from time to time federal banking regulators propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital requirements and related reporting instructions in addition the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal banking regulators to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset 

quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

in addition the frb’s capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases by certain bhcs including wells fargo federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions 

for more information on our capital requirements and planning see the “capital management” section of the 2020 annual report to shareholders 

deposit insurance assessments 

our subsidiary banks in the us including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the dif through assessments on member banks to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate 

the fdic has adopted a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management targeting a designated reserve ratio of 2 for the year ended december 31 2020 the companys fdic deposit insurance assessments totaled 650 million 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

  

fiscal and monetary policies 

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on affiliate marketing 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of 

banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

  

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires the implementation of policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

future legislation or regulation 

economic market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the us and abroad affecting the financial services industry as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive

competition 

  

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance 

 

companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses private equity firms and online lending companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

  

we describe below and in note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and note 29 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2019 annual report to shareholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as nonus governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections in the 2019 annual report to shareholders for additional information

parent bank holding company activities 

  

“financial in nature” requirement we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the frb has implemented a final rule under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act that also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than 

 

satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in march 2017 we announced that the occ had downgraded our most recent cra rating which covers the years 20092012 to “needs to improve” due to previously issued regulatory consent orders and thus we are subject to among other things the prohibitions noted above in addition if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act for more information about our cra rating see the regulatory matters and risk factors sections of the 2019 annual report to shareholders 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines subject to the same deposit limits noted above thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

  

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

  

dividend restrictions 

  

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s 

subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2019 annual report to shareholders 

furthermore under a support agreement dated june 28 2017 as amended and restated on june 26 2019 the “support agreement” among the parent wfc holdings llc an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the parent the “ihc” wells fargo bank na wells fargo securities llc wells fargo clearing services llc and certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the parent designated as material entities for resolution planning purposes or identified as related support entities in our resolution plan the ihc may be restricted from making dividend payments to the parent if certain liquidity andor capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the us bankruptcy code any such restriction could materially and adversely impact the parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations as well as its ability to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2019 annual report to shareholders for additional information on the support agreement 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb requires large bank holding companies bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the frb also finalized rules implementing in the united states the basel committee on banking supervision’s regulatory capital guidelines including the reforms known as basel iii which established various capital requirements for us banking organizations moreover federal banking regulators have finalized a rule that enhances the supplementary leverage ratio requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those us banking organizations such as the company that are designated as global systemically important banks gsibs the failure to maintain any of these minimum capital ratios leverage ratios or buffers could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions 

in addition the frbs enhanced supervision regulations for large bhcs like wells fargo impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers for more information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries see the “capital management” “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2019 annual report to shareholders 

  

 

holding company structure 

  

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks   the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms the company is also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers directors and principal shareholders of the parent and its subsidiary banks 

  

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

  

depositor preference   in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors including the parent and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

  

liability of commonly controlled institutions   all of the company’s subsidiary banks in the us are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

  

doddfrank act   

  

the doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 has resulted in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s the doddfrank act and the numerous rules to implement its provisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision of large bhcs such as wells fargo this includes among other things rules to promote financial stability and prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bhc enhance consumer protections prohibit proprietary trading and implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs regarding riskbased capital and leverage risk and liquidity management stress testing and recovery and resolution planning the doddfrank act including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules has affected and we expect will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity for more information about the doddfrank act and its effect on our business see the “regulatory matters” and risk factors sections of the 2019 annual report to shareholders 

    

capital requirements and planning 

  

the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators these capital rules among other things establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures federal banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions and to implement a liquidity coverage ratio the frb has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured longterm debt a gsib must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal banking regulators to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will 

 

depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

in addition the frbs capital plan rule requires large bhcs to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb has any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhc’s risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions 

for more information on our capital requirements and planning see the “capital management” section of the 2019 annual report to shareholders 

  

deposit insurance assessments 

  

our subsidiary banks in the us including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the dif through assessments on member banks to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to consolidated average assets less average tangible equity and mandated a minimum designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr of 135 in addition to ensuring that the dif reserve ratio reached the statutory minimum of 135 by september 30 2020 the fdic board also finalized a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management whereby the drr has been targeted at 2 

in addition to the base assessments and any surcharge to maintain the dif all fdicinsured depository institutions were required to pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance agency in december 2018 the federal housing finance agency finalized a rule which among other things determined that the final assessment on fico bonds would be paid in march 2019 based on the second quarter assessment percentage this assessment was 014 of the assessable deposit base for first quarter 2019 and 012 for second quarter 2019  for the year ended december 31 2019  the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 526 million  

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

  

fiscal and monetary policies 

  

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the 

united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on affiliate marketing 

  

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

  

patriot act 

  

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct 

 

terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires the implementation of policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

  

future legislation or regulation 

  

economic market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the us and abroad affecting the financial services industry as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

  

we describe below and in note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and note 28 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2018  annual report to shareholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as foreign governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “regulatory matters” and risk factors sections in the 2018  annual report to shareholders for additional information

parent bank holding company activities 

  

“financial in nature” requirement  we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the frb has implemented a final rule under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act that also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or 

 

acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in march 2017 we announced that the occ had downgraded our most recent cra rating which covers the years 20092012 to needs to improve due to previously issued regulatory consent orders and thus we are subject to among other things the prohibitions noted above in addition if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act for more information about our cra rating see the regulatory matters and risk factors sections of the 2018  annual report to shareholders 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines subject to the same deposit limits noted above thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

  

regulatory approval  in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

  

dividend restrictions 

  

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal banking regulators 

have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2018  annual report to shareholders 

furthermore under a support agreement the “support agreement” dated june 28 2017 among the parent wfc holdings llc an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the parent the “ihc” and wells fargo bank na wells fargo securities llc and wells fargo clearing services llc each an indirect subsidiary of the parent the ihc may be restricted from making dividend payments to the parent if certain liquidity andor capital metrics fall below defined triggers any such restriction could materially and adversely impact the parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations as well as its ability to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2018  annual report to shareholders for additional information on the support agreement 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb requires large bank holding companies bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the frb also finalized rules implementing in the united states the basel committee on banking supervision’s regulatory capital guidelines including the reforms known as basel iii which established various capital requirements for us banking organizations moreover federal banking regulators have finalized a rule that enhances the supplementary leverage ratio requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those us banking organizations such as the company that are designated as global systemically important banks gsibs the failure to maintain any of these minimum capital ratios leverage ratios or buffers could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions 

in addition the frbs enhanced supervision regulations for large bhcs like wells fargo impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers for more information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries see the “capital management” “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2018 annual report to shareholders 

  

holding company structure 

  

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks   the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well 

 

as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

  

source of strength  the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

  

depositor preference   in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors including the parent and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

  

liability of commonly controlled institutions   all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

  

doddfrank act     

  

the doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 has resulted in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s the doddfrank act and the numerous rules to implement its provisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision of large bhcs such as wells fargo this includes among other things rules to promote financial stability and prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bhc enhance consumer protections prohibit proprietary trading and implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs regarding riskbased capital and leverage risk and liquidity management 

stress testing and recovery and resolution planning the doddfrank act including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules has affected and we expect will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity for more information about the doddfrank act and its effect on our business see the “regulatory matters” and risk factors sections of the 2018  annual report to shareholders 

    

capital requirements and planning 

  

the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators these capital rules among other things establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures federal banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs like wells fargo and our insured depository institutions and to implement a liquidity coverage ratio the frb has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured longterm debt a gsib must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal banking regulators to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

in addition the frbs capital plan rule requires large bhcs to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb has any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhc’s risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions 

for more information on our capital requirements and planning see the “capital management” section of the 2018  annual report to shareholders 

  

 

deposit insurance assessments 

  

our subsidiary banks including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the dif through assessments on member banks to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to consolidated average assets less average tangible equity and mandated a minimum designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr of 135 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 as required by the doddfrank act and in march 2016 issued a final rule to meet this drr level the final rule which became effective on july 1 2016 imposed on insured depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets such as wells fargo a surcharge of 45 cents per 100 of their assessment base after making certain adjustments the surcharge was in addition to the base assessments paid by the affected institutions the surcharge was completed in third quarter 2018 in addition to ensuring that the dif reserve ratio reached the statutory minimum of 135 by september 30 2020 the fdic board also finalized a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management whereby the drr has been targeted at 2 

in addition to the base assessments and any surcharge all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board this assessment was 046 of the assessable deposit base for first quarter 2018  044 for second quarter 2018 and was 032 for the third and fourth quarters of 2018  for the year ended december 31 2018  the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 11 billion 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

  

fiscal and monetary policies 

  

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans 

and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on affiliate marketing 

  

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

  

patriot act 

  

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires the implementation of policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers 

 

the patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

  

future legislation or regulation 

  

economic market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the us and abroad affecting the financial services industry as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

description of business 

  

general 

  

we are a diversified financial services company we provide retail commercial and corporate banking services through banking locations and offices the internet and other distribution channels to individuals businesses and institutions in all 50 states the district of columbia and in other countries we provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses principally wholesale banking mortgage banking consumer finance equipment leasing agricultural finance commercial finance securities brokerage and investment banking computer and data processing services trust services investment advisory services mortgagebacked securities servicing and venture capital investment

competition 

  

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses private equity firms and online lending companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

  

we describe below and in note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and note 27 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2017  annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as foreign governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “regulatory matters” and risk factors sections in the 2017  annual report to stockholders for additional information

parent bank holding company activities 

  

“financial in nature” requirement  we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the frb has implemented a final rule under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act that also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in march 2017 we announced that the occ had downgraded our most recent cra rating which covers the years 20092012 to needs to improve due to previously issued regulatory consent orders and thus we are subject to among other things the prohibitions noted above in addition if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new 

activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act for more information about our cra rating see the regulatory matters and risk factors sections of the 2017 annual report to stockholders 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines subject to the same deposit limits noted above thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

  

regulatory approval  in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

  

dividend restrictions 

  

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2017  annual report to stockholders 

furthermore under a support agreement the “support agreement” dated june 28 2017 among the parent wfc holdings llc an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the parent the “ihc” and wells fargo bank 

 

na wells fargo securities llc and wells fargo clearing services llc each an indirect subsidiary of the parent the ihc may be restricted from making dividend payments to the parent if certain liquidity andor capital metrics fall below defined triggers any such restriction could materially and adversely impact the parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations as well as its ability to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock see the “regulatory matters” and “risk factors” sections of the 2017 annual report to stockholders for additional information on the support agreement 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb requires large bank holding companies bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the frb also finalized rules implementing in the united states the basel committee on banking supervision’s regulatory capital guidelines including the reforms known as basel iii which established various capital requirements for us banking organizations moreover federal banking regulators have finalized a rule that enhances the supplementary leverage ratio requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions the rule which became effective on january 1 2018 requires a covered bhc to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 5 comprised of a 3 minimum requirement and a supplementary leverage buffer of 2 to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments the rule also requires that all of our insured depository institutions maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6 under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those us banking organizations such as the company that are designated as global systemically important banks gsibs the failure to maintain any of these minimum capital ratios and capital buffers could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions 

in addition the frbs enhanced supervision regulations for large bhcs like wells fargo impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers 

  

holding company structure 

  

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks   the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

  

source of strength  the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

  

depositor preference   in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors including the parent and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

  

liability of commonly controlled institutions   all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

  

doddfrank act     

  

the doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 has resulted in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s the doddfrank act and the numerous rules to implement its provisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision of large bhcs such as wells fargo this includes among other things rules to promote financial stability and prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bhc enhance consumer protections prohibit proprietary trading and implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs regarding riskbased capital and leverage risk and liquidity management stress testing and recovery and resolution planning the doddfrank act including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules has affected and we expect will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity for more information about the doddfrank act and its effect on our business see the “regulatory matters” and risk factors sections of the 2017  annual report to stockholders 

    

 

capital requirements and planning 

  

the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators these capital rules among other things establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures federal banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs like wells fargo and our insured depository institutions and to implement a liquidity coverage ratio the frb has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured longterm debt a gsib must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal banking regulators to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

in addition the frbs capital plan rule requires large bhcs to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb has any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhc’s risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions 

for more information on our capital requirements and planning see the “capital management” section of the 2017  annual report to stockholders 

  

deposit insurance assessments 

  

our subsidiary banks including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the dif through assessments on member banks to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif changed the assessment base from domestic 

deposits to consolidated average assets less average tangible equity and mandated a minimum designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr of 135 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 as required by the doddfrank act and in march 2016 issued a final rule to meet this drr level the final rule which became effective on july 1 2016 imposes on insured depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets such as wells fargo a surcharge of 45 cents per 100 of their assessment base after making certain adjustments the surcharge is in addition to the base assessments paid by the affected institutions and could significantly increase the overall amount of their deposit insurance assessments the fdic expects the surcharge to be in effect for approximately two years however if the dif reserve ratio does not reach 135 by december 31 2018 the final rule provides that the fdic will impose a shortfall assessment on any bank that was subject to the surcharge in addition to ensuring that the dif reserve ratio reaches the statutory minimum of 135 by september 30 2020 the fdic board has also finalized a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management whereby the drr has been targeted at 2 

in addition to the base assessments and any surcharge all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board this assessment was 056 of the assessable deposit base for first quarter 2017  and was 054 for the second third and fourth quarters of 2017  for the year ended december 31 2017  the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 13 billion 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

  

fiscal and monetary policies 

  

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

 

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on affiliate marketing 

  

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

  

patriot act 

  

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires the implementation of policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

  

future legislation or regulation 

  

economic market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the us and abroad affecting the financial services industry as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

description of business 

  

general 

  

we are a diversified financial services company we provide retail commercial and corporate banking services through banking locations and offices the internet and other distribution channels to individuals businesses and institutions in all 50 states the district of columbia and in other countries we provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses principally wholesale banking mortgage banking consumer finance equipment leasing agricultural finance commercial finance securities brokerage and investment banking insurance agency and brokerage services computer and data processing services trust services investment advisory services mortgagebacked securities servicing and venture capital investment 

we have three operating segments for management reporting purposes community banking wholesale banking and wealth and investment management the 2016  annual report to stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments 

  

competition 

  

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses private equity firms and online lending companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

  

we describe below and in note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and note 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2016  annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as foreign governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “regulatory matters” and risk factors sections in the 2016  annual report to stockholders for additional information 

  

general 

  

parent bank holding company  as a bank holding company the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by its primary regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company with securities listed on the new york stock exchange nyse the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies

regulated by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra and in some cases the cftc and the municipal securities rulemaking board and state securities regulators our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states as well as foreign countries in which they conduct business 

  

parent bank holding company activities 

  

“financial in nature” requirement  we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the frb has implemented a final rule under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act that also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in 

activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines subject to the same deposit limits noted above thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

  

regulatory approval  in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

  

dividend restrictions 

  

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2016  annual report to stockholders 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb requires large bank holding companies bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the frb also finalized rules implementing in the united states the basel committee on banking supervision’s regulatory capital guidelines including the reforms known as basel iii which established various capital requirements for us banking organizations moreover federal banking regulators have finalized a rule that enhances the 

 

supplementary leverage ratio requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions the rule which becomes effective on january 1 2018 will require a covered bhc to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 5 comprised of a 3 minimum requirement and a supplementary leverage buffer of 2 to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments the rule will also require that all of our insured depository institutions maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6 under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those us banking organizations such as the company that are designated as global systemically important banks gsibs the failure to maintain any of these minimum capital ratios and capital buffers could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions 

in addition the frbs enhanced supervision regulations for large bhcs like wells fargo impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers 

  

holding company structure 

  

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks   the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

  

source of strength  the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

  

depositor preference   in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured 

creditors including the parent and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

  

liability of commonly controlled institutions   all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

  

doddfrank act     

  

the doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 has resulted in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s the doddfrank act and the numerous rules to implement its provisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision of large bhcs such as wells fargo this includes among other things rules to promote financial stability and prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bhc enhance consumer protections prohibit proprietary trading and implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs regarding riskbased capital and leverage risk and liquidity management stress testing and recovery and resolution planning the doddfrank act including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules has affected and we expect will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity for more information about the doddfrank act and its effect on our business see the “regulatory matters” and risk factors sections of the 2016  annual report to stockholders 

    

capital requirements and planning 

  

the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators these capital rules among other things establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures federal banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs like wells fargo and our insured depository institutions and to implement a liquidity coverage ratio the frb has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured longterm debt a gsib must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if 

 

implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal banking regulators to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

in addition the frbs capital plan rule requires large bhcs to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb has any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhc’s risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions 

for more information on our capital requirements and planning see the “capital management” section of the 2016  annual report to stockholders 

  

deposit insurance assessments 

  

our subsidiary banks including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the dif through assessments on member banks to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to consolidated average assets less average tangible equity and mandated a minimum designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr of 135 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 as required by the doddfrank act and in march 2016 issued a final rule to meet this drr level the final rule which became effective on july 1 2016 imposes on insured depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets such as wells fargo a surcharge of 45 cents per 100 of their assessment base after making certain adjustments the surcharge is in addition to the base assessments paid by the affected institutions and could significantly increase the overall amount of their deposit insurance assessments the fdic expects the surcharge to be in effect for approximately two years however if the dif reserve ratio does not reach 135 by december 31 2018 the final rule provides that the fdic will impose a shortfall assessment on any bank that was subject to the surcharge in addition to ensuring that the dif reserve ratio reaches the statutory minimum of 135 by september 30 2020 the fdic board has also finalized a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management whereby the drr has been targeted at 2 

in addition to the base assessments and any surcharge all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board this assessment was 058 of the assessable deposit base for first quarter 2016  and was 056 for the second third and fourth quarters of 2016 for the year ended december 31 2016  the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 12 billion 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

  

fiscal and monetary policies 

  

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on affiliate marketing 

  

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies 

 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

  

patriot act 

  

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires the implementation of policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

  

future legislation or regulation 

  

economic market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the us and abroad affecting the financial services industry as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

description of business 

  

general 

  

we are a diversified financial services company we provide retail commercial and corporate banking services through banking stores and offices the internet and other distribution channels to individuals businesses and institutions in all 50 states the district of columbia and in other countries we provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses principally wholesale banking mortgage banking consumer finance equipment leasing agricultural finance commercial finance securities brokerage and investment banking insurance agency and brokerage services computer and data processing services trust services investment advisory services mortgagebacked securities servicing and venture capital investment 

we have three operating segments for management reporting purposes community banking wholesale banking and wealth and investment management the 2015  annual report to stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments 

  

competition 

  

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses private equity firms and online lending companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

  

we describe below and in note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and note 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2015  annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as foreign governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “regulatory reform” and risk factors sections in the 2015  annual report to stockholders for additional information

parent bank holding company activities 

  

“financial in nature” requirement  we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the frb has implemented a final rule under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act that also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in 

activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines subject to the same deposit limits noted above thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

  

regulatory approval  in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

  

dividend restrictions 

  

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2015  annual report to stockholders 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb requires large bank holding companies bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the frb also finalized rules implementing in the united states the basel committee on banking supervision’s regulatory capital guidelines including the reforms known as basel iii which established various capital requirements for us banking organizations moreover federal banking regulators have finalized a rule that enhances the 

 

supplementary leverage ratio requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions the rule which becomes effective on january 1 2018 will require a covered bhc to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 5 comprised of a 3 minimum requirement and a supplementary leverage buffer of 2 to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments the rule will also require that all of our insured depository institutions maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6 under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those us banking organizations such as the company that are designated as global systemically important banks gsibs the failure to maintain any of these minimum capital ratios and capital buffers could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions 

in addition the frbs enhanced supervision regulations for large bhcs like wells fargo impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers 

  

holding company structure 

  

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks   the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

  

source of strength  the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

  

depositor preference   in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured 

creditors including the parent and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

  

liability of commonly controlled institutions   all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

  

doddfrank act     

  

the doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 has resulted in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s federal regulatory agencies have issued numerous rulemakings to implement its provisions but a number of the provisions of the doddfrank act still require final rulemaking or additional guidance and interpretation by these agencies or will be implemented over time as a result the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act is not yet known but it has affected and we expect it will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity at the enterprise level the frb has finalized a number of regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bhc these rules implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo regarding riskbased capital and leverage risk and liquidity management and stress testing and would impose debttoequity limits on any bhc that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states the frb has also proposed but not yet finalized additional enhanced prudential standards that would implement single counterparty credit limits and establish remediation requirements for large bhcs experiencing financial distress the occ under separate authority has also finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as wells fargo bank na 

in addition to rules for the enhanced supervision and regulation of large bhcs and other systemically important firms the fdic and frb have implemented rules under the doddfrank act requiring large bhcs like wells fargo to prepare and submit resolution plans known as “living wills” to facilitate the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material distress or its failure we must also prepare and submit to the frb on an annual basis a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support and the occ has published a notice of proposed rulemaking on guidelines to establish standards for recovery planning by large insured national banks such as wells fargo bank na the fdic also released a notice regarding a proposed resolution strategy known as “single point of entry” designed to resolve a 

 

large financial institution in a manner that holds management responsible for its failure maintains market stability and imposes losses on shareholders and creditors in accordance with statutory priorities without imposing a cost on us taxpayers 

federal regulatory agencies have also finalized rules to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act known as the “volcker rule” the volcker rule substantially restricts banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning any interest in or sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund a private equity fund or certain structured transactions that are deemed covered funds 

with respect to consumer protection maters the doddfrank act established the cfpb to ensure consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and to protect consumers from hidden fees and unfair or abusive practices the cfpb concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgagerelated topics required under the doddfrank act including abilitytorepay and qualified mortgage standards mortgage servicing standards loan originator compensation standards highcost mortgage requirements appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higherpriced mortgages the cfpb finalized rules integrating disclosures required of lenders and settlement agents under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act in addition to the exercise of its rulemaking authority the cfpb is continuing its ongoing examination activities with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products including mortgage lending and servicing fair lending requirements student lending activities and auto finance 

federal regulatory agencies issued numerous other rules and proposals to implement various other requirements of the doddfrank act for example federal regulatory agencies have adopted rules establishing a comprehensive framework for regulating overthecounter derivatives in addition federal regulatory agencies have issued rules to implement the doddfrank act’s requirement that sponsors of assetbacked securities abs retain at least a 5 ownership stake in the abs the sec has also adopted a rule governing money market mutual funds that among other things requires significant structural changes to these funds including requiring nongovernmental institutional money market funds to maintain a variable net asset value and providing for the imposition of liquidity fees and redemption gates for all nongovernmental money market funds during periods in which they experience liquidity impairments of a certain magnitude 

for more information about the doddfrank act and its effect on our business see the “regulatory reform” section of the 2015  annual report to stockholders 

    

capital requirements and planning 

  

the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators these capital rules among other things establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures federal banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs like wells fargo and our insured depository institutions and to implement a liquidity coverage ratio the frb has also proposed rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured longterm debt a gsib must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal banking regulators to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

in addition the frbs capital plan rule requires large bhcs to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb has any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhc’s risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions 

for more information on our capital requirements and planning see the “capital management” section of the 2015  annual report to stockholders 

  

deposit insurance assessments 

  

our subsidiary banks including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the dif through assessments on member banks to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to consolidated average assets less average tangible equity and mandated a minimum designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr of 135 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 as required by the doddfrank act and in october 2015 issued a proposed rule to meet this drr level the proposed rule would impose on insured depository institutions with 10 billion or more in assets such as wells fargo a surcharge of 45 cents per 100 of their assessment base after making certain adjustments the proposed surcharge would be in addition to the base assessments paid by the affected institutions and could significantly increase the overall amount of their deposit insurance assessments the fdic board has also finalized a 

 

comprehensive longrange plan for dif management whereby the fdic board set the drr at 2 

in addition to the base assessments and any proposed surcharge all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board this assessment was 060 of the assessable deposit base for the first second and fourth quarters of 2015  and was 058 for third quarter 2015 the assessment is 058 of the assessable deposit base for first quarter 2016  for the year ended december 31 2015  the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 973 million 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

  

fiscal and monetary policies 

  

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on affiliate marketing 

  

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different 

affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

  

patriot act 

  

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act required us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

  

future legislation or regulation 

  

in light of recent conditions in the us and global financial markets and the us and global economy legislators the presidential administration and regulators have continued their increased focus on regulation of the financial services industry proposals that further increase regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the us congress in state legislatures and abroad in addition not all regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act have been proposed finalized or implemented further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and 

 

other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition the same uncertainty exists with respect to regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act but that have not yet been proposed or finalized

description of business 

  

general 

  

we are a diversified financial services company we provide retail commercial and corporate banking services through banking stores and offices the internet and other distribution channels to individuals businesses and institutions in all 50 states the district of columbia and in other countries we provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses principally wholesale banking mortgage banking consumer finance equipment leasing agricultural finance commercial finance securities brokerage and investment banking insurance agency and brokerage services computer and data processing services trust services investment advisory services mortgagebacked securities servicing and venture capital investment 

we have three operating segments for management reporting purposes community banking wholesale banking and wealth brokerage and retirement the 2014 annual report to stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments 

  

competition 

  

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

  

we describe below and in note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and note 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2014 annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as foreign governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “regulatory reform” and risk factors sections in the 2014 annual report to stockholders for additional information

parent bank holding company activities 

  

“financial in nature” requirement  we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the frb has implemented a final rule under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act that also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in 

activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines subject to the same deposit limits noted above thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

  

regulatory approval  in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

  

dividend restrictions 

  

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2014 annual report to stockholders 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb requires large bank holding companies bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the frb also finalized rules in july 2013 implementing in the united states the basel committee on banking supervision’s regulatory capital guidelines including the reforms known as basel iii these rules introduce new capital conservation buffer requirements moreover federal banking regulators have finalized a rule that enhances the 

 

supplementary leverage ratio requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo and their insured depository institutions the rule which becomes effective on january 1 2018 will require a covered bhc to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 5 to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments the rule will also require that all of our insured depository institutions maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6 in order to be considered well capitalized in december 2014 the frb also proposed rules to implement an additional capital surcharge on those us banking organizations such as the company that are designated as global systemically important banks the failure to maintain any of these minimum capital ratios and capital buffers could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions 

in addition the frbs enhanced supervision regulations for large bhcs like wells fargo impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers 

  

holding company structure 

  

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks   the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

  

source of strength  the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

  

depositor preference   in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors including the parent and depositors whose deposits 

are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

  

liability of commonly controlled institutions   all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

  

doddfrank act     

  

the doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 has resulted in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s federal regulatory agencies have issued numerous rulemakings to implement its provisions but a number of the provisions of the doddfrank act still require final rulemaking or additional guidance and interpretation by these agencies as a result the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act is not yet known but it has affected and we expect it will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity at the enterprise level the frb has finalized a number of regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bhc these rules implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo regarding riskbased capital and leverage risk and liquidity management and stress testing and would impose debttoequity limits on any bhc that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states the frb has also proposed but not yet finalized additional enhanced prudential standards that would implement single counterparty credit limits and establish remediation requirements for large bhcs experiencing financial distress the occ under separate authority has also finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as wells fargo bank na 

in addition to rules for the enhanced supervision and regulation of large bhcs and other systemically important firms the fdic and frb have implemented rules under the doddfrank act requiring large bhcs like wells fargo to prepare and submit resolution plans known as “living wills” to facilitate the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material distress or its failure the fdic also released a notice regarding a proposed resolution strategy known as “single point of entry” designed to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that holds management responsible for its failure maintains market stability and imposes losses on shareholders and creditors in accordance with statutory priorities without imposing a cost on us taxpayers 

federal regulatory agencies have also finalized rules to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act known as the “volcker rule” the volcker rule substantially restricts banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or 

 

owning any interest in or sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund a private equity fund or certain structured transactions that are deemed covered funds 

with respect to consumer protection maters the doddfrank act established the cfpb to ensure consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and to protect consumers from hidden fees and unfair or abusive practices the cfpb concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgagerelated topics required under the doddfrank act including abilitytorepay and qualified mortgage standards mortgage servicing standards loan originator compensation standards highcost mortgage requirements appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higherpriced mortgages the cfpb also recently finalized rules integrating disclosures required of lenders and settlement agents under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act in addition to the exercise of its rulemaking authority the cfpb is continuing its ongoing examination activities with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products including mortgage lending and servicing fair lending requirements student lending activities and auto finance 

federal regulatory agencies issued numerous other rules and proposals to implement various other requirements of the doddfrank act for example federal regulatory agencies have adopted rules establishing a comprehensive framework for regulating overthecounter derivatives in addition federal regulatory agencies have issued rules to implement the doddfrank act’s requirement that sponsors of assetbacked securities abs retain at least a 5 ownership stake in the abs the sec has also adopted a rule governing money market mutual funds that among other things requires significant structural changes to these funds including requiring institutional prime money market funds to maintain a variable net asset value and providing for the imposition of liquidity fees and redemption gates for all nongovernmental money market funds during periods in which they experience liquidity impairments of a certain magnitude 

for more information about the doddfrank act and its effect on our business see the “regulatory reform” section of the 2014 annual report to stockholders 

    

capital requirements and planning 

  

the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators these capital rules among other things establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures federal banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs like wells fargo and our insured depository institutions and to implement a liquidity coverage ratio the frb has also indicated that it is in the process of considering new rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured debt a company must hold to facilitate its orderly liquidation often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if 

implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal banking regulators to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

in addition the frbs capital plan rule requires large bhcs to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb has any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhc’s risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions 

for more information on our capital requirements and planning see the “capital management” section of the 2014 annual report to stockholders 

  

deposit insurance assessments 

  

our bank subsidiaries including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the dif through assessments on member banks 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to consolidated average assets less average tangible equity and mandated a minimum designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr of 135 in october 2010 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 as required by the doddfrank act the fdic board has also finalized a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management whereby the fdic board set the drr at 2 

in february 2011 the fdic board approved a final rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate for large and highly complex institutions those that are very large and are structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique challenges and risks in the case of failure the assessment rate is determined by combining supervisory ratings and certain financial measures into scorecards the score received by an institution is converted into an assessment rate for the institution the fdic retains the ability to adjust the total score of large and highly complex institutions based upon quantitative or qualitative measures not adequately captured in the scorecards 

all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds 

 

issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were used to capitalize the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation this assessment was 062 of the assessable deposit base during 2014 and is 060 of the assessable deposit base for first quarter 2015 for the year ended december 31 2014 the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 928 million 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

  

fiscal and monetary policies 

  

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on crossselling 

  

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of crossselling products and services between those affiliated companies 

  

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

  

patriot act 

  

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act required us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

  

future legislation or regulation 

  

in light of recent conditions in the us and global financial markets and the us and global economy legislators the presidential administration and regulators have continued their increased focus on regulation of the financial services industry proposals that further increase regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the us congress in state legislatures and abroad in addition not all regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act have been proposed or finalized by federal regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our 

 

business results of operations or financial condition the same uncertainty exists with respect to regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act but that have not yet been proposed or finalized

description of business   

general 

  

we are a diversified financial services company we provide retail commercial and corporate banking services through banking stores and offices the internet and other distribution channels to individuals businesses and institutions in all 50 states the district of columbia and in other countries we provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses principally wholesale banking mortgage banking consumer finance equipment leasing agricultural finance commercial finance securities brokerage and investment banking insurance agency and brokerage services computer and data processing services trust services investment advisory services mortgagebacked securities servicing and venture capital investment 

we have three operating segments for management reporting purposes community banking wholesale banking and wealth brokerage and retirement the 2013 annual report to stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments 

  

competition 

  

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

  

  

 

  

  

regulation and supervision 

  

we describe below and in notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2013 annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as foreign governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “risk factors” section in the 2013 annual report to stockholders for additional information

parent bank holding company activities 

  

“financial in nature” requirement we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is not generally required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

  

 

  

  

  

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

  

regulatory approval   in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

  

dividend restrictions 

  

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2013 annual report to stockholders 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb finalized rules in late december 2011 that require large bank holding companies bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the frb also finalized rules in july 2013 implementing in the united states the basel committee on banking supervision’s regulatory capital guidelines including the reforms known as basel iii these rules introduce new capital conservation buffer requirements the failure to maintain the capital buffers once effective could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions 

a number of regulatory proposals are also under consideration that could further limit our ability to pay dividends in late 2011 the frb proposed enhanced regulations for large bhcs like wells fargo that would impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers federal banking regulators are also considering proposals that would impose an enhanced supplementary leverage ratio requirement on large bhcs like wells fargo and our insured depository institutions under the proposal we would be required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 5 in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments 

  

holding company structure 

  

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks   the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

  

source of strength   the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

  

depositor preference   in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors including the parent and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

  

liability of commonly controlled institutions   all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository 

  

 

  

  

institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

  

doddfrank act 

  

the doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 will result in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s federal regulatory agencies have issued numerous rulemakings to implement its provisions but a number of the provisions of the doddfrank act still require final rulemaking or additional guidance and interpretation by these agencies as a result the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act is not yet known but it has affected and we expect it will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity at the enterprise level the frb has finalized a number of regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bhc these rules implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs like wells fargo regarding riskbased capital and leverage risk and liquidity management and stress testing and would impose debttoequity limits on any bhc that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states the frb has also proposed but not yet finalized additional enhanced prudential standards that would implement single counterparty credit limits and establish remediation requirements for large bhcs experiencing financial distress 

in addition to requiring rules for the enhanced supervision and regulation of large bhcs and other systemically important firms the doddfrank act also requires the fdic and frb to implement rules requiring large bhcs like wells fargo to prepare and submit resolution plans known as “living wills” to facilitate the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material distress or its failure under the rules implemented by the fdic and frb in this regard wells fargo submitted its resolution plan on june 29 2013 if the frb and fdic determine that our resolution plan is deficient the doddfrank act authorizes the frb and fdic to impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth or activities until we submit a plan remedying the deficiencies if the frb and fdic ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy the deficiencies they could order us to divest assets or operations in order to facilitate our orderly resolution in the event of our material distress or failure our national bank subsidiary wells fargo bank na is also required to prepare a resolution plan for the fdic under separate regulatory authority and submitted the plan on june 29 2013 

the fdic also recently released a notice regarding a proposed resolution strategy known as “single point of entry” designed to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that holds management responsible for its failure maintains market stability and imposes losses on shareholders and creditors in accordance with statutory priorities without imposing a cost on us taxpayers implementation of the strategy would require that institutions maintain a sufficient amount of available equity and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries the fdic has requested public comment on this proposed resolution strategy 

federal regulatory agencies have also recently finalized rules to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act known as the “volcker rule” the volcker rule substantially restricts banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning any interest in or sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund a private equity fund or certain structured transactions that are deemed covered funds wells fargo is not required to come into compliance with the volcker rule’s restrictions until july 21 2015 but we will be required to report certain trading metrics beginning june 30 2014 during the conformance period banking entities are expected to engage in “good faith” planning efforts appropriate for their activities and investments to enable them to conform all of their activities and investments to the volcker rule’s restrictions by no later than july 21 2015 as a banking entity with more than 50 billion in consolidated assets wells fargo will also be subject to enhanced compliance program requirements 

with respect to consumer protection maters the doddfrank act established the cfpb to ensure consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and to protect consumers from hidden fees and unfair or abusive practices the cfpb concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgagerelated topics required under the doddfrank act including abilitytorepay and qualified mortgage standards mortgage servicing standards loan originator compensation standards highcost mortgage requirements appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higherpriced mortgages the cfpb also recently finalized rules integrating disclosures required of lenders and settlement agents under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act in addition to the exercise of its rulemaking authority the cfpb is continuing its ongoing examination activities with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products including credit card addon products fair lending requirements and student lending activities 

federal regulatory agencies issued numerous other proposals to implement various other requirements of the doddfrank act including rules issued by the cftc and sec establishing a comprehensive framework for regulating overthecounter derivatives many other proposals have not yet been finalized including proposed rules requiring sponsors of assetbacked securities abs to retain an ownership stake in the abs in addition both the financial stability oversight council and the sec are considering additional regulations to address perceived risks that money market mutual funds may pose to the financial stability of the united states although we have analyzed these and other proposed rules the absence of final rules makes it difficult for us to fully estimate their impact on the company  

  

capital requirements 

  

the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators in july 2013 federal banking regulators issued final rules that substantially amended the riskbased capital rules for banking organizations the rules implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms in the us comply with 

  

 

  

  

changes required by the doddfrank act and replace the existing basel ibased capital requirements these final capital rules among other things establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures we were required to begin complying with the rules on january 1 2014 subject to phasein periods that are scheduled to be fully phased in by january 1 2022 federal banking regulators have also issued proposals to impose a supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs like wells fargo and our insured depository institutions and to implement a liquidity coverage ratio our capital adequacy assessment process contemplates a wide range of risks that the company is exposed to and also takes into consideration our performance under a variety of stressed economic conditions as well as regulatory expectations and guidance rating agency viewpoints and the view of capital markets participants 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal banking regulators to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

  

capital planning 

  

in late 2011 the frb finalized rules to require large bhcs to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb had any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhc’s risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions 

on march 14 2013 the frb notified us that it did not object to our 2013 capital plan included in the 2013 comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar since the frb notification the company took several capital actions including increasing its quarterly common stock dividend rate to 030 per share redeeming wachovia preferred funding corp preferred securities that will no longer count as tier 1 capital under the doddfrank act and the final basel iii capital standards and repurchasing shares of our common stock 

our 2014 ccar which was submitted on january 3 2014 included a comprehensive capital plan supported by an assessment of expected uses and sources of capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios similar to the process the frb used to conduct the ccar in 2013 as part of the 2014 ccar the frb also generated a supervisory stress test which assumed a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the company to estimate performance the frb is expected to review the supervisory stress results both as required under the doddfrank act using a common set of capital actions for all large bhcs and by taking into account the company’s proposed capital actions the frb has indicated that it will publish its supervisory stress test results as required under the doddfrank act and the related ccar results taking into account the company’s proposed capital actions in march 2014 

  

deposit insurance assessments 

  

our bank subsidiaries including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor the dif was formed march 31 2006 upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 the fdir act the fdir act established a range of 115 to 150 within which the fdic board of directors may set the designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr the fdir act also granted the fdic board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif raised the minimum drr to 135 and removed the upper limit of the range in october 2010 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 as required by the doddfrank act at the same time the fdic board proposed a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management in december 2010 as part of the comprehensive plan the fdic board adopted a final rule to set the drr at 2 and in february 2011 the fdic board approved the remainder of the comprehensive plan 

on february 7 2011 the fdic board approved a final rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing that took effect on april 1 2011 to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate generally the assessment base is an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity for large and highly complex institutions those that are very large and are structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique challenges and risks in the case of failure the assessment rate is determined by combining supervisory ratings and certain financial measures into scorecards the score received by an institution is converted into an assessment rate for the institution the fdic retains the ability to adjust the total score of large and highly complex institutions based upon quantitative or qualitative measures not adequately captured in the scorecards 

all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were used to capitalize the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation this assessment was 064 of the assessable deposit base during 2013 and 

  

 

  

  

is 062 of the assessable deposit base for first quarter 2014 for the year ended december 31 2013 the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 10 billion 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

  

fiscal and monetary policies 

  

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on crossselling 

  

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of crossselling products and services between those affiliated companies 

  

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

  

patriot act 

  

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act required us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

  

future legislation or regulation 

  

in light of recent conditions in the us and global financial markets and the us and global economy legislators the presidential administration and regulators have continued their increased focus on regulation of the financial services industry proposals that further increase regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the us congress in state legislatures and abroad in addition not all regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act have been proposed or finalized by federal regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition the same uncertainty exists with respect to regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act but that have not yet been proposed or finalized

description of business 

general 

we are a diversified financial services company we provide retail commercial and corporate banking services through banking stores and offices the internet and other distribution channels to individuals businesses and institutions in all 50 states the district of columbia and in other countries we provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses principally wholesale banking mortgage banking consumer finance equipment leasing agricultural finance commercial finance securities brokerage and investment banking insurance agency and brokerage services computer and data processing services trust services investment advisory services mortgagebacked securities servicing and venture capital investment 

we have three operating segments for management reporting purposes community banking wholesale banking and wealth brokerage and retirement the 2012 annual report to stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments 

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

 

  

regulation and supervision 

we describe below and in notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2012 annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies as well as foreign governments and financial regulators and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “risk factors” section in the 2012 annual report to stockholders for additional information 

general 

parent bank holding company as a bank holding company the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by its primary regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company with securities listed on the new york stock exchange nyse the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies 

subsidiary banks our subsidiary national banks and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and also by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic the frb the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the sec and the commodities futures trading commission cftc the foreign branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective foreign financial regulators as well as by the occ and the frb foreign subsidiaries of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which they conduct business our statechartered bank is subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the fdic and in addition is regulated and examined by its state banking department 

nonbank subsidiaries many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies as well as the frb our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra and in some cases the cftc and the municipal securities rulemaking board and state securities regulators our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states as well as foreign countries in which they conduct business 

parent bank holding company activities 

“financial in nature” requirement we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is not generally required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into 

 

  

an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states 

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend 

restrictions to financial statements included in the 2012 annual report to stockholders 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb finalized rules in late december 2011 that require large bank holding companies bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends in late 2011 the frb also proposed additional regulations that could restrict or prohibit our ability to pay dividends these rules which have not been finalized would impose capital distribution restrictions including on the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers 

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

depositor preference in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of deposits payable in the united states including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails claims of insured and uninsured us depositors along with claims of the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors including the parent and depositors whose deposits 

 

  

are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s nonus offices 

liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 will result in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s financial regulatory agencies have issued numerous rulemakings to implement its provisions but a number of rulemakings required by the doddfrank act have either not yet been proposed or have not been finalized as a result the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act is not yet known but it has affected and we expect it will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity at the enterprise level the frb published proposed rules in december 2011 to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act regarding enhanced supervision and regulation of large bhcs like wells fargo and other systemically significant firms the proposed rules included new riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements counterparty credit exposure limits risk management requirements stress testing requirements debttoequity requirements and early remediation requirements in october 2012 the frb issued final rules regarding stress testing requirements which became effective on november 15 2012 the occ issued and finalized similar rules during 2012 for stress testing of large national banks these stress testing rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities large bhcs and banks must undertake as well as rules governing testing controls oversight and disclosure requirements until the remaining provisions of the december 2011 frb proposal are finalized we are unable to fully estimate their impact on the company but we expect the final rules will significantly increase our compliance and regulatory requirements 

in addition to requiring rules for the enhanced supervision and regulation of large bhcs and other systemically significant firms the doddfrank act also requires the fdic and frb to implement rules requiring large bhcs like wells fargo to prepare and submit resolution plans known as “living wills” to facilitate the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material distress or its failure under the rules implemented by the fdic and frb in this regard wells fargo is 

required to submit its resolution plan to the fdic and frb on or before july 1 2013 this date is also the deadline for the submission of a resolution plan for our principal banking subsidiary wells fargo bank national association wfbna pursuant to its general rulemaking authority the fdic also requires large banks like wfbna to prepare resolution plans 

federal regulatory agencies issued numerous other rulemakings in 2011 and 2012 to implement various other requirements of the doddfrank act but many of these other proposed rules remain open for comment agencies have proposed rules establishing a comprehensive framework for the regulation of derivatives restricting banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning interests in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds the volcker rule and requiring sponsors of assetbacked securities abs to retain an ownership stake in the abs in november 2012 the financial stability oversight council proposed new regulations for addressing perceived risks that money market mutual funds may pose to the financial stability of the united states once final recommendations are issued the sec is required to adopt the recommendations or explain its reasons for not implementing the recommendations although we have analyzed these and other proposed rules the absence of final rules and the complexity of some of the proposed rules make it difficult for the company to estimate the financial compliance or operational impacts of the proposals 

the doddfrank act also established the cfpb to ensure consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and to protect consumers from hidden fees and unfair or abusive practices the cfpb which has now been in operation for over a year has begun exercising supervisory review of banks under its jurisdiction and has concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgagerelated topics required under the doddfrank act including abilitytorepay and qualified mortgage standards mortgage servicing standards loan originator compensation standards highcost mortgage requirements appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higherpriced mortgages several of the cfpb’s rulemakings were issued in january 2013 and we continue to analyze their requirements to determine the impact of the rules to our businesses during 2013 we expect the cfpb to focus its rulemaking efforts on integrating disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents and expanding the scope of information lenders must report in connection with mortgage and other housingrelated loan applications in addition to the exercise of its rulemaking authority the cfpb is continuing its ongoing examination activities with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products 

capital requirements 

we are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb which are substantially similar to those imposed by the occ and the fdic on depository institutions within their jurisdictions under these guidelines a depository institution’s or a holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories tier 1 capital is considered core capital 

 

  

and generally includes common stockholders’ equity qualifying preferred stock and trust preferred securities and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries reduced by goodwill net of related taxes certain intangible and other assets in excess of prescribed limitations and adjusted for the aggregate impact of certain items included in other comprehensive income total capital includes tier 1 capital subordinated debt and other components that do not qualify for tier 1 capital and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a specified percentage of riskweighted assets in addition to measures of tier 1 and total capital an additional measure of capital tier 1 common equity reflects common equity and retained earnings less goodwill and certain other deductions 

national banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain tier 1 and total capital equal to at least 4 and 8 respectively of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit the riskbased capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad creditrisk considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be exposed to eg interest rate market liquidity and operational risks the frb may therefore set higher capital requirements for categories of banks eg systematically important firms or for an individual bank as situations warrant for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets for these reasons we are expected to operate with a capital position well above the minimum ratios with the amount of capital held to be determined by us through an internal capital assessment that corresponds to our broad risk exposure 

the regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders’ equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements during 2009 in conjunction with the frb’s scap stress test process the ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital there is currently no mandated minimum ratio 

in june 2004 the basel committee on bank supervision bcbs published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital that were designed to be more risk sensitive and to promote enhanced risk management practices among large internationally active banking organizations the united states federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a final rule similar to the international guidelines in november 2007 this advanced capital adequacy framework is known as “basel ii” and is intended to more closely align regulatory capital requirements with actual risks basel ii incorporates three pillars that address a capital adequacy b supervisory review which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline through increased disclosure requirements embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy measurement and management that relate to credit risk market risk and operational risk banking organizations are required to enhance the measurement and 

management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for calculating riskbased capital requirements basel ii includes safeguards that include a requirement that banking organizations conduct a parallel run over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital under the new regulatory capital rules and the existing general riskbased capital rules before solely operating under the basel ii framework a requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before operating under basel ii without floors and a commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to ensure basel ii is working as intended however the federal bank regulators adopted a final rule in 2011 to replace the transitional floors in the advanced approaches with a permanent capital floor equal to the riskbased capital requirements under the basel i capital adequacy guidelines wells fargo is implementing the advanced approaches under basel ii and entered the parallel run in july 2012 with regulatory approval 

in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for banks that meet certain specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 4 our tier 1 and total riskbased capital ratios and leverage ratio as of december 31 2012 are included in note 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2012 annual report to stockholders at december 31 2012 the company and each of its subsidiary banks were “well capitalized” under the applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines 

in december 2010 the bcbs finalized a set of international guidelines for determining regulatory capital known as “basel iii” these guidelines were developed in response to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and were intended to address many of the weaknesses identified in the banking sector as contributing to the crisis including excessive leverage inadequate and low quality capital and insufficient liquidity buffers the basel iii guidelines would 

      the bcbs has also proposed additional tier 1 common equity surcharge requirements for global systemically important banks gsibs the surcharge ranges from 10 to 35 of risk 

 

  

weighted assets depending on the bank’s systemic importance which is determined under an indicatorbased approach that would consider five broad categories crossjurisdictional activity size interconnectedness substitutabilityfinancial institution infrastructure and complexity these additional capital requirements for gsibs which would be phased in beginning in january 2016 and become fully effective on january 1 2019 would be in addition to the minimum basel iii 70 tier 1 common equity requirement finalized in december 2010 the financial stability board fsb in an updated list published in november 2012 based on yearend 2011 data identified the company as one of the 28 gsibs and provisionally determined that the company’s surcharge would be 10 the fsb may revise the list of gsibs and their required surcharges prior to implementation based on additional or future data 

us regulatory authorities have been considering the bcbs capital guidelines and proposals and in june 2012 the us banking regulators jointly issued three notices of proposed rulemaking that are essentially intended to implement the bcbs capital guidelines for us banks together these notices of proposed rulemaking would among other things 

    although the proposals contemplated an effective date of january 1 2013 with phased in compliance requirements the rules have not yet been finalized by the us banking regulators due to the volume of comments received and concerns expressed during the comment period the notices of proposed rulemaking did not address the bcbs capital surcharge proposals for gsibs or the proposed basel iii liquidity standards us regulatory authorities have indicated that these proposals will be addressed at a later date the us banking regulators have approved a final rule to implement changes to the market risk capital rule which requires banking organizations with significant trading activities to adjust their capital requirements to better account for the market risks of those activities 

although uncertainty exists regarding final capital rules we evaluate the impact of basel iii on our capital ratios based on our interpretation of the proposed capital requirements and we estimate that our tier 1 common equity ratio under the basel iii proposals exceeded the fully phasedin minimum of 70 by 119 basis points at december 31 2012 the proposed basel iii 

capital rules and interpretations and assumptions used in estimating our basel iii calculations are subject to change depending on final promulgation of basel iii capital rulemaking 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb has closely monitored capital levels of the institutions it supervises during the ongoing financial disruption and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the federal deposit insurance act fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

capital planning 

in late 2011 the frb finalized rules to require large bhcs to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb had any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhc’s risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions 

on march 13 2012 the frb notified us that it did not object to our 2012 capital plan included in the 2012 comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar since the frb notification the company took several capital actions during 2012 including increasing its quarterly common stock dividend rate to 022 per share completing the redemption of 27 billion of trust preferred securities that will no longer count as tier 1 capital under the doddfrank act and the proposed basel iii capital standards repurchasing shares of our common stock and purchasing an aggregate of 22 billion of our subordinated debt with an effective yield of 202 in tender offers for such securities in first quarter 2013 the company increased its dividend to 025 per share and submitted for redemption an additional 28 billion of trust preferred securities each of these actions was contemplated by the capital plan included in the 2012 ccar 

under the frb’s capital plan rule our 2013 ccar included a comprehensive capital plan supported by an assessment of expected uses and sources of capital over a given planning 

 

  

horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios similar to the process the frb used to conduct a ccar in 2012 as part of the 2013 ccar the frb also generated a supervisory stress test driven by a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the company to estimate performance the frb is expected to review the supervisory stress results both as required under the doddfrank act using a common set of capital actions for all large bhcs and by taking into account the company’s proposed capital actions we submitted our board approved 2013 capital plan to the frb on january 4 2013 the frb has indicated that it will publish its supervisory stress test results as required under the doddfrank act on march 7 2013 and the related ccar results taking into account the company’s proposed capital actions on march 14 2013 

deposit insurance assessments 

our bank subsidiaries including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor the dif was formed march 31 2006 upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 the fdir act the fdir act established a range of 115 to 150 within which the fdic board of directors may set the designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr the fdir act also granted the fdic board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif raised the minimum drr to 135 and removed the upper limit of the range in october 2010 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 as required by the doddfrank act at the same time the fdic board proposed a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management in december 2010 as part of the comprehensive plan the fdic board adopted a final rule to set the drr at 2 and in february 2011 the fdic board approved the remainder of the comprehensive plan the restoration plan eliminated a 3 basis point increase in the annual assessment rates that was to take effect january 1 2011 

in 2009 the fdic undertook several measures in an effort to replenish the dif on february 27 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule modifying the riskbased assessment system and set new initial base assessment rates beginning april 1 2009 rates ranged from a minimum of 12 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized institutions with the highest credit ratings to 45 cents per 100 for those institutions posing the most risk to the dif riskbased adjustments to the initial assessment rate could have lowered the rate to 7 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized banks with the highest credit ratings or raised the rate to 775 cents per 100 for depository institutions posing the most risk to the dif on may 22 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured 

depository institution’s assets minus tier 1 capital as of june 30 2009 the amount of the special assessment for any institution was limited to 10 basis points times the institution’s assessment base for the second quarter 2009 on november 17 2009 the fdic amended its regulations to require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for fourth quarter 2009 and all of 2010 2011 and 2012 for purposes of determining the prepayment the fdic used the institution’s assessment rate in effect on september 30 2009 the combined prepayment amount for our banking subsidiaries was 39 billion any unused prepaid assessment will be refunded on june 28 2013 

on february 7 2011 the fdic board approved a final rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing that took effect on april 1 2011 to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate generally the assessment base is an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity for large and highly complex institutions those that are very large and are structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique challenges and risks in the case of failure the assessment rate is determined by combining supervisory ratings and certain financial measures into scorecards the score received by an institution will be converted into an assessment rate for the institution the fdic retains the ability to adjust the total score of large and highly complex institutions based upon quantitative or qualitative measures not adequately captured in the scorecards 

all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 100 to 102 cents per 100 of assessable deposits during the first nine months of 2011 to coincide with doddfrank act mandated changes to the insurance assessment base the fdic established lower fico assessment rates 066 cents per 100 of assessment base for 2012 and 064 cents per 100 of assessment base for first quarter 2013 for the year ended december 31 2012 the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 14 billion 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

fiscal and monetary policies 

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 

 

  

we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on crossselling 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of crossselling products and services between those affiliated companies 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act required us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

future legislation or regulation 

in light of recent conditions in the us and global financial markets and the us and global economy legislators the presidential administration and regulators have continued their increased focus on regulation of the financial services industry proposals that further increase regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the us congress in state legislatures and abroad in addition not all regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act have been proposed or finalized by federal regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition the same uncertainty exists with respect to regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act but that have not yet been proposed or finalized

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

 

  

regulation and supervision 

we describe below and in notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2011 annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “risk factors” section in the 2011 annual report to stockholders for additional information 

general 

parent bank holding company as a bank holding company the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by its primary regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a company with securities listed on the new york stock exchange nyse the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies 

subsidiary banks our subsidiary national banks and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and also by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the frb the foreign branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective foreign financial regulators as well as by the occ and the frb foreign subsidiaries of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which they conduct business our statechartered banks are subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the fdic and in addition are regulated and examined by their respective state banking departments 

nonbank subsidiaries many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies our insurance subsidiaries are subject 

to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies as well as the frb our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra and in some cases the municipal securities rulemaking board and state securities regulators our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states as well as foreign countries in which they conduct business 

parent bank holding company activities 

“financial in nature” requirement we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is not generally required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior notice to the frb may be required however if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act also prohibits our ability to merge acquire all or substantially all of the assets of or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be 

 

  

prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

interstate banking under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those states 

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system 

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2011 annual report to stockholders 

in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us the frb finalized rules in late december 2011 that require large bank holding companies bhcs including wells fargo to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends in late 2011 the frb also proposed additional regulations that would restrict or prohibit our ability to pay dividends upon the occurrence of capital stress test risk management or liquidity risk management triggers 

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

capital loans by the parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition in the event of the parent’s bankruptcy any commitment by the parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act fdi act provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have 

 

  

priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 

liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 will result in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s although a number of its provisions are effective many of these provisions require the issuance of rules or other agency guidance which remain open to public comment and are not final as a result much of the impact of the doddfrank act is not yet known but we anticipate the doddfrank act will affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity at the enterprise level the frb recently proposed rules to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act regarding enhanced supervision and regulation of large bhcs like wells fargo and other systemically significant firms the proposed rules include new riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements counterparty credit exposure limits risk management requirements stress testing requirements debttoequity requirements and early remediation requirements the frb published the proposed rules in december 2011 until the proposed rules are final we are unable to accurately estimate their impact on the company but we expect the final rules will significantly increase our compliance and regulatory requirements 

in addition to proposing rules in 2011 for the enhanced supervision and regulation of large bhcs and other systemically significant firms federal financial regulators also implemented rules to facilitate the resolution of financial companies at the end of 2011 the fdic and frb finalized regulations requiring large bhcs like wells fargo to prepare and periodically revise resolution plans in the event of material distress or failure the fdic also finalized rules implementing provisions of the doddfrank act authorizing it to resolve some financial companies and under its authority as the agency responsible for insuring deposits with banks the fdic implemented rules requiring large 

banks to prepare resolution plans the fdic also implemented rules shifting the basis for calculating fdic assessments from deposits to assets and imposing a separate riskbased assessment on large banks 

during 2011 the frb finalized rules implementing other provisions of the doddfrank act including for the regulation of interchange fees the durbin amendment and for the repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on business checking accounts the final rules implementing the durbin amendment establish a maximum fee that we may generally receive for electronic debit transactions and the repeal of the prohibition on payment of interest on business checking accounts required changes to our affected products 

federal regulatory agencies issued numerous other rulemakings in 2011 to implement various other requirements of the doddfrank act but many of these other proposed rules remain open for comment agencies have proposed rules establishing a comprehensive framework for the regulation of derivatives prohibiting banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning interests in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds the volcker rule and requiring sponsors of assetbacked securities abs to retain an ownership stake in the abs although we have analyzed these and other proposed rules the absence of final rules and the complexity of some of the proposed rules make it difficult for the company to estimate the financial compliance or operational impacts 

the doddfrank act also established the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb to ensure consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and to protect consumers from hidden fees and unfair or abusive practices the cfpb has begun exercising supervisory review of banks under its jurisdiction and is expected to focus its rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgagerelated topics such as the steering of consumers toward certain products abusive or unfair lending practices disclosure requirements mortgage underwriting standards and mortgage servicing standards proposed regulations have been issued on several topics including minimum mortgage underwriting standards however the content of final rules and impacts to our businesses are uncertain at this time 

capital requirements 

we are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb which are substantially similar to those imposed by the occ and the fdic on depository institutions within their jurisdictions under these guidelines a depository institution’s or a holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories tier 1 capital is considered core capital and generally includes common stockholders’ equity qualifying preferred stock and trust preferred securities and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries reduced by goodwill net of related taxes certain intangible and other assets in excess of prescribed limitations and adjusted for the aggregate impact of certain items included in other comprehensive income total capital includes tier 1 capital subordinated debt and other components that do not qualify for 

 

  

tier 1 capital and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a specified percentage of riskweighted assets in addition to measures of tier 1 and total capital a further measure of capital tier 1 common capital reflects common equity and retained earnings less goodwill and certain other deductions 

during 2011 we redeemed 92 billion of our trust preferred securities as a result of a provision of the doddfrank act known as the collins amendment that phases out trust preferred securities from the calculation of tier 1 capital we will be required to phase existing trust preferred securities out of tier 1 capital over three years beginning january 1 2013 we expect proposed rules implementing the collins amendment to provide additional clarity regarding the timing of the phase out 

national banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain tier 1 and total capital equal to at least 4 and 8 respectively of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit the riskbased capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad creditrisk considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be exposed to eg interest rate market liquidity and operational risks the frb may therefore set higher capital requirements for categories of banks eg systematically important firms or for an individual bank as situations warrant for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets for these reasons we are expected to operate with a capital position well above the minimum ratios with the amount of capital held to be determined by us through an internal capital assessment that corresponds to our broad risk exposure 

the regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders’ equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements during 2009 in conjunction with the frb’s scap stress test process the ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital there is currently no mandated minimum ratio 

in june 2004 the basel committee on bank supervision bcbs published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital that are designed to be more risk sensitive than the existing framework and to promote enhanced risk management practices among large internationally active banking organizations the united states federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a final rule similar to the international guidelines in november 2007 this advanced capital adequacy framework is known as “basel ii” and is intended to more closely align regulatory capital requirements with actual risks basel ii incorporates three pillars that address a capital adequacy b supervisory review which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline through increased disclosure requirements embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy measurement and management that relate to credit risk market risk and operational risk banking organizations 

are required to enhance the measurement and management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for calculating riskbased capital requirements basel ii includes safeguards that include a requirement that banking organizations conduct a parallel run over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital under the new regulatory capital rules and the existing general riskbased capital rules before solely operating under the basel ii framework a requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before operating under basel ii without floors and a commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to ensure basel ii is working as intended however the federal bank regulators adopted a final rule in 2011 to replace the transitional floors in the advanced approaches with a permanent capital floor equal to the riskbased capital requirements under the basel i capital adequacy guidelines wells fargo is implementing the advanced approach under basel ii and has established a project management infrastructure to implement the regulations and enter the parallel run in 2012 with regulatory approval our delayed entry into the parallel run phase was approved by the frb in 2010 as a result of our acquisition of wachovia 

in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for banks that meet certain specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 4 our tier 1 and total riskbased capital ratios and leverage ratio as of december 31 2011 are included in note 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2011 annual report to stockholders at december 31 2011 the company and each of its subsidiary banks were “well capitalized” under the applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines 

in december 2010 the bcbs finalized a set of international guidelines for determining regulatory capital known as “basel iii” these guidelines were developed in response to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and address many of the weaknesses identified in the banking sector as contributing to the crisis including excessive leverage inadequate and low quality capital and insufficient liquidity buffers basel iii fundamentals 

 

 

  

    the us regulatory bodies are reviewing the final international standards and final us rulemaking is expected to be completed in 2012 

the bcbs proposed additional tier 1 common equity surcharge requirements for global systemically important banks gsibs the surcharge ranges from 10 to 35 depending on the bank’s systemic importance to be determined under an indicatorbased approach that would consider five broad categories crossjurisdictional activity size interconnectedness substitutabilityfinancial institution infrastructure and complexity these additional capital requirements which would be phased in beginning in january 2016 and become fully effective on january 1 2019 would be in addition to the minimum basel iii 70 tier 1 common equity requirement finalized in december 2010 the financial stability board has determined that the company is one of the initial 29 gsibs that would be subject to the surcharge but has not yet determined the surcharge amount for us and the other banks 

in december 2011 the frb issued proposed rules requiring large bhcs like wells fargo to submit annual capital plans demonstrating their ability to maintain capital above existing minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a tier 1 common ratio of 5 under both expected and stressed conditions over at least a ninequarter period the proposed rule did not include basel iii capital requirements or a surcharge for gsibs the frb however did indicate it is continuing to implement basel iii capital reforms and expects to adopt rules in 2014 that will implement a gsib surcharge consistent with the bcbs approach 

although uncertainty exists regarding final capital rules including the frb’s approach to capital requirements we evaluate the impact of basel iii on our capital ratios based on our interpretation of the proposed capital requirements and we estimate that our tier 1 common equity ratio under the basel iii proposal exceeded the fully phasedin minimum of 70 by 50 basis points at the end of 2011 this estimate is subject to change depending on final promulgation of basel iii capital rulemaking and interpretations thereof by regulatory authorities 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb has closely monitored capital levels of the institutions it supervises during the ongoing financial disruption and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital 

safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

capital planning 

in connection with its increased focus on the adequacy of regulatory capital and risk management for large financial firms the frb required large banks to submit a capital plan in early 2011 as part of its comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar following submission of our capital plan on january 7 2011 the frb notified us on march 18 2011 that it did not object to our 2011 capital plan since that notification the company took several capital actions in 2011 including increasing the quarterly common stock dividend to 012 a share repurchasing 24 billion of our common stock and redeeming 92 billion of trust preferred securities that will no longer count as tier 1 capital under the doddfrank act and the proposed basel iii capital standards 

in late 2011 the frb finalized rules to require large bhcs to submit capital plans annually and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhc’s risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions 

under the frb’s new capital plan rule 2012 ccar will include a bhc’s comprehensive capital plan supported by an assessment of expected uses and sources of capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios similar to the process the frb relied upon to conduct the 2011 ccar as part of the 2012 ccar the frb will also generate a supervisory stress test driven by a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the bhc to estimate performance the frb has indicated it will publish its estimates of performance under this scenario on a bhcspecific basis we submitted our boardapproved 2012 capital plan to the frb on january 6 2012 we expect the frb’s response to our submission in march 2012 

deposit insurance assessments 

our bank subsidiaries including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor the dif was formed march 31 2006 upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 the fdir act the fdir act established a range of 115 to 150 within which 

 

  

the fdic board of directors may set the designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr the fdir act also granted the fdic board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif raised the minimum drr to 135 and removed the upper limit of the range in october 2010 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 as required by the doddfrank act at the same time the fdic board proposed a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management in december 2010 as part of the comprehensive plan the fdic board adopted a final rule to set the drr at 2 and in february 2011 the fdic board approved the remainder of the comprehensive plan the restoration plan eliminated a 3 basis point increase in the annual assessment rates that was to take effect january 1 2011 

in 2009 the fdic undertook several measures in an effort to replenish the dif on february 27 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule modifying the riskbased assessment system and set new initial base assessment rates beginning april 1 2009 rates ranged from a minimum of 12 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized institutions with the highest credit ratings to 45 cents per 100 for those institutions posing the most risk to the dif riskbased adjustments to the initial assessment rate could have lowered the rate to 7 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized banks with the highest credit ratings or raised the rate to 775 cents per 100 for depository institutions posing the most risk to the dif on may 22 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution’s assets minus tier 1 capital as of june 30 2009 the amount of the special assessment for any institution was limited to 10 basis points times the institution’s assessment base for the second quarter 2009 on november 17 2009 the fdic amended its regulations to require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for fourth quarter 2009 and all of 2010 2011 and 2012 for purposes of determining the prepayment the fdic used the institution’s assessment rate in effect on september 30 2009 the combined prepayment amount for our banking subsidiaries was 39 billion of which 14 billion remains available to offset future assessments 

on february 7 2011 the fdic board approved a final rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing that took effect on april 1 2011 to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate generally the assessment base is an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity for large and highly complex institutions those that are very large and are structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique challenges and risks in the case of failure the assessment rate is determined by combining supervisory ratings and certain financial measures into scorecards the score received by an institution will be converted into an assessment rate for the institution the fdic retains the ability to adjust the total score 

of large and highly complex institutions based upon quantitative or qualitative measures not adequately captured in the scorecards 

all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 100 to 102 cents per 100 of assessable deposits during the first nine months of 2011 to coincide with doddfrank act mandated changes to the insurance assessment base the fdic established lower fico assessment rates 68 cents per 100 of assessment base for the fourth quarter of 2011 and 66 cents per 100 of assessment base for first quarter 2012 for the year ended december 31 2011 the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 13 billion 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

fiscal and monetary policies 

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on crossselling 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information 

 

  

is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of crossselling products and services between those affiliated companies 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act required us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

future legislation or regulation 

in light of recent conditions in the us and global financial markets and the us and global economy legislators the presidential administration and regulators have continued their increased focus on regulation of the financial services industry proposals that further increase regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be 

introduced in the us congress in state legislatures and abroad only a small percentage of the regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act have been proposed or finalized by federal regulators further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that they or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition the same uncertainty exists with respect to regulations authorized or required under the doddfrank act but that have not yet been proposed or finalized

description of business 

general 

we are a diversified financial services company we provide retail commercial and corporate banking services through banking stores located in 39 states and the district of columbia 

 

we provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses principally wholesale banking mortgage banking consumer finance equipment leasing agricultural finance commercial finance securities brokerage and investment banking insurance agency and brokerage services computer and data processing services trust services investment advisory services mortgagebacked securities servicing and venture capital investment 

we have three operating segments for management reporting purposes community banking wholesale banking and wealth brokerage and retirement the 2010 annual report to stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments 

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

we describe below and in notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2010 annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and policies that are described banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “risk factors” section in the 2010 annual report to stockholders for additional information 

general 

parent bank holding company as a bank holding company the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by its primary regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a listed company on the new york stock exchange nyse the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies 

subsidiary banks our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and also by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the frb the foreign branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective foreign financial regulators as well as by the occ and the frb our statechartered banks are subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the fdic and in addition are regulated and examined by their respective state banking departments

parent bank holding company activities 

“financial in nature” requirement we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association 

because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that any of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those states 

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities 

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2010 annual report to stockholders 

the parent’s board reduced its quarterly common stock dividend to 005 per share in second quarter 2009 to retain current period earnings and build common equity as a participant in the supervisory capital assessment program scap the parent must consult with the federal reserve staff before increasing the level of dividends the frb published clarifying supervisory guidance in first quarter 2009 sr 094 applying supervisory guidance and regulations on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases at bank holding companies pertaining to the frb’s criteria assessment and approval process for reductions in capital as with all 19 participants in the scap under this supervisory letter before raising our common stock dividend the parent must consult with the federal reserve staff and demonstrate that its actions are consistent with the existing supervisory guidance including demonstrating that its internal capital assessment process is consistent with the complexity of its activities and risk profile in november 2010 the frb updated the sr 094 guidance to require the original 19 scap participants including the company to submit a capital plan review cpr proposal to the frb no later than january 7 2011 the company has submitted a cpr to the frb that outlines proposed capital actions by the company including per share dividend increases and share repurchases from the company’s benefit plans and in the open market the company cannot guarantee whether or when the frb will approve its cpr or what other conditions the frb may impose on the company in order for the company to increase its common stock dividend or repurchase shares 

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

capital loans by the parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition in the event of the parent’s bankruptcy any commitment by the parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act fdi act provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 

liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

doddfrank act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act enacted on july 21 2010 will result in broad changes to the us financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s although much of the impact is not yet known we anticipate the doddfrank act will affect most of our businesses in some way either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks capital or liquidity at the enterprise level the many provisions of the doddfrank act regarding enhanced supervision and regulation of large banking organizations and other systemically significant firms are expected to significantly increase our compliance and regulatory requirements 

the doddfrank act authorizes or requires numerous rulemakings by federal regulatory agencies on a wide range of topics including the enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically significant firms the establishment of the bureau of consumer financial protection the financial stability oversight council and the office of financial research the application of federal preemption on national banks and their operating subsidiaries the development of the fdic’s orderly liquidation authority for covered financial companies the exclusion of trust preferred securities from treatment as tier 1 capital the collins amendment changes to the method of calculating fdic assessments the adoption of a number of corporate governance and executive compensation reforms the regulation of debit card interchange fees the durbin amendment the regulation of swaps and other derivative activities the repeal of limits on the payment of interest on business deposit accounts changes to assetbacked securities markets restrictions on proprietary trading by financial institutions the volcker rule additional regulation of securities brokers and investment advisers and additional regulation of the residential mortgage business although a number of rulemaking proposals have already been issued by regulatory agencies the great majority of the rulemakings required or authorized under the doddfrank act will not become effective until well into 2011 or thereafter we have done considerable analysis to estimate the level of operational or compliance impact of these rulemakings on different parts of our organization however in the absence of specific final rules we cannot quantify the financial impacts of these rulemakings on the company 

capital requirements 

we are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb which are substantially similar to those imposed by the occ and the fdic on depository institutions within their jurisdictions under these guidelines a depository institution’s or a holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories tier 1 capital is considered core capital and generally includes common stockholders’ equity qualifying preferred stock and trust preferred securities and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries reduced by goodwill net of related taxes certain intangible and other assets in excess of prescribed limitations and adjusted for the aggregate impact of certain items included in other comprehensive income total capital includes tier 1 capital subordinated debt and other components that do not qualify for tier 1 capital and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a specified percentage of riskweighted assets in addition to measures of tier 1 and total capital a further measure of capital tier 1 common capital reflects common equity and retained earnings less goodwill and certain other deductions 

under the doddfrank act trust preferred securities will be excluded from the calculation of tier 1 capital pursuant to a provision known as the collins amendment we will be required to phase existing trust preferred securities out of tier 1 capital over three years beginning january 1 2013 we expect proposed rules implementing the collins amendment to provide additional clarity regarding the timing of the phase out 

national banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain tier 1 and total capital equal to at least 4 and 8 respectively of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit the riskbased capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad creditrisk considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be exposed to eg interest rate market liquidity and operational risks the frb may therefore set higher capital requirements for categories of banks eg systematically important firms or for an individual bank as situations warrant for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets for these reasons we are expected to operate with a capital position well above the minimum ratios with the amount of capital held to be determined by us through an internal capital assessment that corresponds to our broad risk exposure 

the regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders’ equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements during 2009 in conjunction with the frb’s scap stress test process the ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital there is currently no mandated minimum ratio 

in june 2004 the basel committee on bank supervision published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital that are designed to be more risk sensitive than the existing framework and to promote enhanced risk management practices among large internationally active banking organizations the united states federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a final rule similar to the international guidelines in november 2007 this advanced capital adequacy framework is known as “basel ii” and is intended to more closely align regulatory capital requirements with actual risks basel ii incorporates three pillars that address a capital adequacy b supervisory review which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline through increased disclosure requirements embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy measurement and management that relate to credit risk market risk and operational risk banking organizations are required to enhance the measurement and management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for calculating riskbased capital requirements basel ii includes safeguards that include a requirement that banking organizations conduct a parallel run over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital under the new regulatory capital rules and the existing general riskbased capital rules before solely operating under the basel ii framework a requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before operating under basel ii without floors and a commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to ensure basel ii is working as intended following a successful parallel run period a banking organization would have to progress through three transitional periods each lasting at least one year during which there would be floors on potential declines in riskbased capital requirements as calculated under the current rules those transitional floors provide for 

maximum cumulative reductions of required riskbased capital of 5 during the first year of implementation 10 in the second year and 15 in the third year a banking organization will need approval from its primary federal regulator to move into each of the transitional floor periods and at the end of the third transitional floor period to move to full implementation wells fargo is implementing the advanced approach under basel ii and has established a project management infrastructure to implement the regulations and enter the parallel run in 2012 with regulatory approval our delayed entry into the parallel run phase was approved by the frb in 2010 as a result of our acquisition of wachovia 

in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for banks that meet certain specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 4 our tier 1 and total riskbased capital ratios and leverage ratio as of december 31 2010 are included in note 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2010 annual report to stockholders at december 31 2010 the company and each of its subsidiary banks were “well capitalized” under the applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines 

in july 2009 the basel committee on bank supervision published an additional set of international guidelines for review known as basel iii which were finalized in december 2010 the additional guidelines were developed in response to the financial crisis of 2008  2010 and address many of the weaknesses identified in the banking sector as contributing to the crisis including excessive leverage inadequate and low quality capital and insufficient liquidity buffers basel iii fundamentals 

      the us regulatory bodies are reviewing the final basel iii international standards and final us rulemaking is expected to be completed in 2011 although uncertainty exists regarding the final us rules we have used our best efforts to interpret and estimate the effects of basel iii on our capital ratios 

in december 2010 the frb determined to conduct a second stress test survey of the 19 original scap participants to forecast capital levels for financial institutions under a frbdefined set of adverse economic assumptions the stress test survey also required us to provide forecasts under two additional firmdefined scenarios and provide a list of capital actions including dividend increases share repurchases and securities redemptions that the company would pursue if results of the stress test survey were approved by the frb the company submitted its cpr by the january 7 2011 deadline the company cannot guarantee whether or when the frb will approve its cpr or what other conditions the frb may impose in order for the company to pursue its proposed capital actions 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb has closely monitored capital levels of the institutions it supervises during the ongoing financial disruption and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

deposit insurance assessments 

our bank subsidiaries including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor the dif was formed march 31 2006 upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 the act the act established a range of 115 to 150 within which the fdic board of directors may set the designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr the act also granted the fdic board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio 

the doddfrank act gave the fdic greater discretion to manage the dif raised the minimum drr to 135 and removed the upper limit in october 2010 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 as required by the doddfrank act at the same time the fdic board proposed a comprehensive longrange plan for dif management in december 2010 as part of the comprehensive plan the fdic board adopted a final rule to set the drr at 2 and in february 2011 the fdic board approved the remainder of the comprehensive plan the restoration plan foregoes a 3 basis point increase in the annual assessment rates that was to take effect january 1 2011 

to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on their deposits assessment base and their institutional risk category assessment rate the fdic determines an institution’s risk category by combining its supervisory ratings with its financial ratios and other risk measures for large institutions assets of 10 billion or more the fdic generally determines risk by combining supervisory ratings the institution’s longterm debt issuer ratings and beginning april 1 2009 certain financial ratios 

in 2009 the fdic undertook several measures in an effort to replenish the dif on february 27 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule modifying the riskbased assessment system and set new initial base assessment rates beginning april 1 2009 rates range from a minimum of 12 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized institutions with the highest credit ratings to 45 cents per 100 for those institutions posing the most risk to the dif riskbased adjustments to the initial assessment rate may lower the rate to 7 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized banks with the highest credit ratings or raise the rate to 775 cents per 100 for depository institutions posing the most risk to the dif on may 22 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution’s assets minus tier 1 capital as of june 30 2009 the amount of the special assessment for any institution was limited to 10 basis points times the institution’s assessment base for the second quarter 2009 on november 17 2009 the fdic amended its regulations to require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for fourth quarter 2009 and all of 2010 2011 and 2012 for purposes of determining the prepayment the fdic used the institution’s assessment rate in effect on september 30 2009 the combined prepayment amount for our banking subsidiaries was 39 billion of which 26 billion remains available to offset future assessments 

on february 7 2011 the fdic board approved a final rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing that will take effect on april 1 2011 the final rule approves the comprehensive plan for dif management that was proposed in october 2010 changes the assessment base for all institutions from deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as required by the doddfrank act and modifies the riskbased assessment system for large institutions under the final rule risk categories and longterm debt issuer ratings are eliminated as factors for determining an institution’s assessment rate the new system combines supervisory ratings and certain financial measures into two scorecards one for most of the large institutions and another for highly complex institutions those that are very large and are structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique challenges and risks in the case of failure the score received by an institution will be converted into an assessment rate for the institution the fdic retains the ability to adjust the total score of large institutions based upon quantitative or qualitative measures not adequately captured in the scorecards we estimate these changes will result in additional quarterly deposit insurance assessments of 40 million after tax beginning with the second quarter of 2011 

all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 104 to 106 cents per 100 of assessable deposits in 2010 the fdic established the fico assessment rate effective for first quarter 2011 at 102 cents annually per 100 of assessable deposits for the year ended december 31 2010 the company’s fdic deposit insurance assessments including fico assessments totaled 12 billion 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

fiscal and monetary policies 

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on crossselling 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of crossselling products and services between those affiliated companies 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities and exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act required us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

future legislation or regulation 

in light of recent conditions in the us and global financial markets and the us and global economy legislators the presidential administration and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry proposals that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the us congress in state legislatures and from applicable regulatory authorities these proposals may change banking statutes and regulation and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted these proposals could increase our cost of doing business affect our compensation structure limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the 

importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

we describe below and in notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2009 annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and policies that are described banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions see the “risk factors” section in the 2009 annual report to stockholders for additional information 

general 

parent bank holding company as a bank holding company the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by its primary regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a listed company on the new york stock exchange nyse the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies 

subsidiary banks our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and also by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the frb the foreign branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective foreign financial regulators as well as by the occ and the frb our statechartered banks are subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the fdic and in addition are regulated and examined by their respective state banking departments 

nonbank subsidiaries many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies as well as the frb our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra and in some cases the municipal securities rulemaking board and state securities regulators our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states as well as foreign countries in which they conduct business 

parent bank holding company activities 

“financial in nature” requirement we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complimentary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that any of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of 

time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those states 

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities 

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent’s subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2009 annual report to stockholders 

the parent’s board reduced its quarterly common stock dividend to 005 per share in second quarter 2009 to retain current period earnings and build common equity as a participant in the supervisory capital assessment program scap the parent must consult with the federal reserve staff before increasing the level of dividends the frb published clarifying supervisory guidance in first quarter 2009 sr 094 applying supervisory guidance and regulations on the payment of dividends stock redemptions and stock repurchases at bank holding companies pertaining to the frb’s criteria assessment and approval process for reductions in capital as with all 19 participants in the scap under this supervisory letter before raising our common dividend the parent must consult with the federal reserve staff and demonstrate that its actions are consistent with the existing supervisory guidance including demonstrating that its internal capital assessment process is consistent with the complexity of its activities and risk profile

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

capital loans by the parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition in the event of the parent’s bankruptcy any commitment by the parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act fdi act provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 

liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the 

appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

capital requirements 

we are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb which are substantially similar to those imposed by the occ and the fdic on depository institutions within their jurisdictions under these guidelines a depository institution’s or a holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is classified into one of three tiers tier 1 capital includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock at the holding company level and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill and certain other deductions tier 2 capital includes among other things perpetual preferred stock not qualified as tier 1 capital subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations tier 3 capital includes qualifying unsecured subordinated debt at least onehalf of a bank’s total capital must qualify as tier 1 capital 

national banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain tier 1 capital and the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 respectively of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit the riskbased capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad creditrisk considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be exposed to eg interest rate market liquidity and operational risks the frb may therefore set higher capital requirements for categories of banks eg systematically important firms or for an individual bank as situations warrant for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets for these reasons we are expected to operate with a capital position well above the minimum ratios with the amount of capital held to be determined by us though an internal capital assessment that corresponds to our broad risk exposure 

the regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders’ equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements during 2009 in conjunction with the frb’s scap stress test process the ratio of tier 1 common equity to risk weighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital there is currently no mandated minimum ratio 

in june 2004 the basel committee on bank supervision published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital that are designed to be more risk sensitive than the existing framework and to promote enhanced risk management practices among large internationally active banking organizations the united states federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a final rule similar to the international guidelines in november 2007 this new advance capital adequacy framework is known as “basel ii” and is intended to more closely align regulatory 

capital requirements with actual risks basel ii incorporates three pillars that address a capital adequacy b supervisory review which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline through increased disclosure requirements embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy measurement and management that relate to credit risk market risk and operational risk banking organizations are required to enhance the measurement and management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for calculating riskbased capital requirements basel ii includes safeguards that include a requirement that banking organizations conduct a parallel run over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital under the new regulatory capital rules and the existing general riskbased capital rules before solely operating under the basel ii framework a requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before operating under basel ii without floors and a commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to ensure basel ii is working as intended following a successful parallel run period a banking organization would have to progress through three transitional periods each lasting at least one year during which there would be floors on potential declines in riskbased capital requirements as calculated under the current rules those transitional floors provide for maximum cumulative reductions of required riskbased capital of 5 during the first year of implementation 10 in the second year and 15 in the third year a banking organization will need approval from its primary federal regulator to move into each of the transitional floor periods and at the end of the third transitional floor period to move to full implementation wells fargo is implementing the advanced approach under basel ii and has established a project management infrastructure to implement the regulations 

in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for banks that meet certain specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 4 our tier 1 and total riskbased capital ratios and leverage ratio as of december 31 2009 are included in note 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2009 annual report to stockholders at december 31 2009 the company and each of its subsidiary banks were “well capitalized” under the applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines 

in addition in 2009 the frb conducted a test under the scap to forecast capital levels for financial institutions in an adverse economic scenario following the results of that stress test the frb required the company to generate a 137 billion regulatory capital buffer by november 9 2009 the company exceeded this requirement through an 86 billion gross proceeds common stock offering strong revenue performance realization of deferred tax assets and other internally generated sources including core deposit intangible amortization 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions in addition the frb has closely monitored capital levels of the institutions it supervises during the ongoing financial disruption and may require such 

institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations such determinations proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure executive compensation and risk management the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

deposit insurance assessments 

our bank subsidiaries including wells fargo bank na and wachovia bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor the dif was formed march 31 2006 upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 the act the act established a range of 115 to 150 within which the fdic board of directors may set the designated reserve ratio reserve ratio or drr the current target drr is 125 however the act has eliminated restrictions on premium rates based on the drr and granted the fdic board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio 

to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on their deposits and their institutional risk category the fdic determines an institution’s risk category by combining its supervisory ratings with its financial ratios and other risk measures for large institutions assets of 10 billion or more the fdic generally determines risk by combining supervisory ratings the institution’s longterm debt issuer ratings and beginning april 1 2009 certain financial ratios 

recent depository institutional failures have resulted in a decline in the dif reserve ratio to below 115 under the act in october 2008 the fdic board adopted a restoration plan to return the dif to its statutorily mandated minimum reserve ratio of 115 within five years in february 2009 given the extraordinary circumstances facing the banking industry the board amended its restoration plan to allow the fund seven years to return to the ratio of 115 in may 2009 congress amended the statute governing establishment of the plan to allow the fdic up to eight years to return the dif reserve ratio back to 115 absent extraordinary circumstances 

in 2009 the fdic undertook several measures in an effort to replenish the dif on february 27 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule modifying the riskbased assessment system and set new initial base assessment rates beginning april 1 2009 rates range from a minimum of 12 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized institutions with the highest credit ratings to 45 cents per 100 for those institutions posing the most risk to the dif riskbased adjustments to the initial assessment rate may lower the rate to 7 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized banks with the highest credit ratings or raise the rate to 775 cents per 100 for depository institutions posing the most risk to the dif 

on may 22 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution’s assets minus tier 1 capital as of june 30 2009 the amount of the special assessment for any institution was limited to 10 basis points times the institution’s assessment base for the second quarter 2009 on september 29 2009 the fdic increased the annual assessment rates uniformly by 3 basis points beginning in 2011 on november 17 2009 the fdic amended its regulations to require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 2011 and 2012 for purposes of determining the prepayment the fdic used the institution’s assessment rate in effect on september 30 2009 the combined prepayment amount for our banking subsidiaries was 39 billion 

on january 12 2010 the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on ways the fdic’s riskbased assessment system could be changed to account for the risks posed by certain employee compensation programs the fdic is concerned with adjusting riskbased assessment rates to adequately compensate the dif for risks inherent in the design of certain compensation programs any change to the riskbased assessment system would be intended to improve the way risk is differentiated among institutions rather than generate revenue for the dif

all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay an annual assessment towards interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 102 to 114 cents per 100 of assessable deposits in 2009 the fdic established the fico assessment rate effective for first quarter 2010 at 106 cents annually per 100 of assessable deposits 

in 2009 under the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program participating institutions paid a premium of 10 cents per 100 to fully insure domestic noninterestbearing transaction accounts the assessment was paid on account balances in excess of the insurance limits our bank subsidiaries will not participate in this program beginning january 1 2010 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

fiscal and monetary policies 

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on crossselling 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors 

federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act which have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of crossselling products and services between those affiliated companies this may result in certain crosssell programs being less effective than they have been in the past 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities and exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting the nyse has imposed a number of new corporate governance requirements as well 

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

us treasury’s tarp capital purchase program 

on october 28 2008 we issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase our common stock to the us treasury as a participant in the tarp capital purchase program on december 23 2009 we redeemed all of the preferred stock issued to the us treasury and repaid the entire 25 billion investment plus accrued dividends the us treasury continues to hold the warrant during the period that the us treasury owned the preferred stock we were subject to numerous additional regulations including restrictions on our ability to increase our common stock dividend limitations on the compensation arrangements for our senior executive officers and the next 20 most highly compensated employees and additional corporate governance standards following the redemption of the preferred stock we are no longer subject to these regulations other than certain reporting and certification obligations related to activities during 2009 

fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program 

we participated in the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp the tlgp had two components the debt guarantee program which provided a temporary guarantee of newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by eligible entities and the transaction account guarantee program which provided a temporary unlimited guarantee of funds in noninterestbearing transaction accounts at fdicinsured institutions the debt guarantee program expired on october 31 2009 and wells fargo opted out of the transaction account guarantee program effective december 31 2009 

future legislation 

in light of current conditions in the us and global financial markets and the us and global economy legislators the presidential administration and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry proposals that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the us congress in state legislatures and from applicable regulatory authorities these proposals may change banking statutes and regulation and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted these proposals could increase or decrease our cost of doing business impact our compensation structure limit or expand permissible activities 

or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

description of business 

general

we have three operating segments for management reporting purposes community banking wholesale banking and wells fargo financial the 2008 annual report to stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments 

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

we describe below and in notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2008 annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and policies that are described banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is 

intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole not investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions

companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines from time to time to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complimentary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that any of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those states 

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the 

acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities 

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and principal and interest on its debt is dividends from its subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2008 annual report to stockholders federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines 

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured in specified amounts a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

capital loans by the parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition in the event of the parent’s bankruptcy any commitment by the parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to 

maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act fdi act provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 

liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

capital requirements 

we are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb which are substantially similar to those imposed by the occ and the fdic on depository institutions within their jurisdictions under these guidelines a depository institution’s or a holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is classified into one of three tiers tier 1 capital includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock at the holding company level and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill and certain other deductions tier 2 capital includes among other things perpetual preferred stock not qualified as tier 1 capital subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations tier 3 capital includes qualifying unsecured subordinated debt at least onehalf of a bank’s total capital must qualify as tier 1 capital 

national banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain tier 1 capital and the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 respectively of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit the federal bank regulatory agencies may however set higher capital requirements for an individual bank or when a bank’s particular circumstances warrant the frb may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets also the frb considers a “tangible tier 1 leverage ratio” deducting all intangibles and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or engaging in new activities 

effective april 1 2002 the frb occ and fdic issued new rules that establish minimum capital requirements for equity investments in nonfinancial companies these rules impose a capital charge that increases incrementally as the level of nonfinancial equity investments increases relative to tier 1 capital these capital charges range from tier 1 capital charges of 8 to 25 of the adjusted carrying value of the nonfinancial equity investments 

the frb occ and fdic rules also require us to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into our regulatory capital computations under the market risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading activities 

in june 2004 the basel committee on bank supervision published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital that are designed to be more risk sensitive than the existing framework and to promote enhanced risk management practices among large internationally active banking organizations the united states federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a final rule similar to the international guidelines in november 2007 this new advance capital adequacy framework is known as “basel ii” and is intended to more closely align regulatory capital requirements with actual risks basel ii incorporates three pillars that address a capital adequacy b supervisory review which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline through increased disclosure requirements embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy measurement and management that relate to credit risk market risk and operational risk banking organizations are required to enhance the measurement and management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for calculating riskbased capital requirements under the final rule banks subject to the rule must develop an implementation plan within six months of the rule’s effective date with the transitional period for capital calculation to begin within 36 months of the effective date of the final rule basel ii includes safeguards that include a requirement that banking organizations conduct a parallel run over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital under the new regulatory capital rules and the existing general riskbased capital rules before solely operating under the basel ii framework a requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before operating under basel ii without floors and a commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to ensure basel ii is working as intended the first possible year for a bank to begin its parallel run is 2008 following a successful parallel run period a banking organization would have to progress through three transitional periods each lasting at least one year during which there would be floors on potential declines in riskbased capital requirements as calculated under the current rules those transitional floors provide for maximum cumulative reductions of required riskbased capital of 5 during the first year of implementation 10 in the second year and 15 in the third year 2009 is the first possible year a bank may begin its first of the three transitional floor periods a banking organization will need approval from its primary federal regulator to move into each of the transitional floor periods and at the end of the third transitional floor period to move to full implementation we continue to analyze the basel ii capital standards and have established a project management infrastructure to address and meet the new regulations 

in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for banks that meet certain 

specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 4 our tier 1 and total riskbased capital ratios and leverage ratio as of december 31 2008 are included in note 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2008 annual report to stockholders 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions such proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

deposit insurance assessments 

our bank subsidiaries including wells fargo bank na and wachovia bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor the dif was formed march 31 2006 upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 the act established a range of 115 to 150 within which the fdic board of directors may set the designated reserve ratio drr the current target drr is 125 however the act has eliminated the restrictions on premium rates based on the drr and grants the fdic board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio 

to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on their deposits and their institutional risk category the fdic determines an institution’s risk category by combining its supervisory ratings with its financial ratios and other risk measures for large institutions assets of 10 billion or more the fdic generally determines risk by combining supervisory ratings with the institution’s longterm debt issuer ratings recent failures have resulted in a decline in the reserve ratio to below 115 under the act the fdic is required to establish and implement a restoration plan to restore the reserve ratio to 115 within five years of the establishment of the plan the fdic adopted a final rule effective january 1 2009 raising current rates uniformly by 7 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for the first quarter of 2009 only rates for first quarter 2009 will range from a minimum of 12 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized banks with the highest credit ratings to 50 cents for 

institutions posing the most risk to the dif proposed rates beginning april 1 2009 range from a minimum initial assessment rate of 10 cents per 100 of domestic deposits to a maximum of 45 cents per 100 of domestic deposits riskbased adjustments to the initial assessment rate may lower or raise a depository institution’s rate to 8 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for wellmanaged wellcapitalized banks with the highest credit ratings to 775 cents for institutions posing the most risk to the dif the final rule is expected early in 2009 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay an annual assessment to interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 110 to 114 cents per 100 of assessable deposits in 2008 the fdic established the fico assessment rate effective for the first quarter of 2009 at approximately 114 cents annually per 100 of assessable deposits 

additionally under the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program in 2009 participating depository institutions will pay a premium of 10 cents per 100 to fully insure domestic noninterestbearing transaction accounts this additional assessment is paid on account balances in excess of the insurance limits 

federal home loan bank membership 

we are a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta the federal home loan bank of dallas the federal home loan bank of des moines and the federal home loan bank of san francisco collectively the fhlbs each member of each of the fhlbs is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of the applicable fhlb the board of directors of each fhlb can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the federal housing finance board because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment in any of the fhlbs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event potential future payments to the fhlbs are not determinable 

fiscal and monetary policies 

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or 

changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on crossselling 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors 

federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act the fact act which have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different wells fargo companies for the purpose of crossselling wells fargo’s products and services this may result in certain crosssell programs being less effective than they have been in the past wells fargo has complied with these regulations 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities and exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting the nyse has imposed a number of new corporate governance requirements as well 

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering

compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

us treasury’s tarp capital purchase program 

on october 28 2008 wells fargo issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase its common stock to the us treasury as a participant in the tarp capital purchase program prior to october 28 2011 unless we have redeemed all of this preferred stock or the us treasury has transferred all of this preferred stock to a third party the consent of the us treasury will be required for us to among other things increase our common stock dividend above the current quarterly cash dividend of 034 per share or repurchase our common stock or outstanding preferred stock except in limited circumstances further as long as the preferred stock issued to the us treasury is outstanding dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to our common stock are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on that preferred stock subject to certain exceptions in addition until the us treasury ceases to own any of our securities sold under the tarp capital purchase program the compensation arrangements for our senior executive officers must comply with the us emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa and the rules and regulations thereunder eesa requires the following provisions with respect to our chief executive officer chief financial officer and our next three most highly compensated officers senior executive officers limits on compensation to exclude incentives to take unnecessary and excessive risks a clawback with respect to incentive compensation based on statements of earnings gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate and a prohibition on golden parachute payments eesa also limits the deductibility of compensation earned by our senior executive officers to 500000 per year

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 stimulus act which was signed into law on february 17 2009 imposes extensive new restrictions on participants in the tarp capital purchase program the new restrictions include additional limits on executive compensation such as prohibiting the payment or accrual of any bonus retention award or incentive compensation to our senior executive officers and the next 20 most highly compensated employees except for the payment of longterm restricted stock prohibiting any compensation plan that would encourage the manipulation of earnings and extending the clawback required by eesa to the top 20 most highly compensated employees the stimulus act also requires compliance with new corporate governance standards including an annual “say on pay” shareholder vote the adoption of policies regarding excessive or luxury expenditures and a certification by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer that we have complied with the standards in the stimulus act the full impact of the stimulus act is not yet certain because it calls for additional regulatory action the company will continue to monitor the effect of the stimulus act and the anticipated regulations 

fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program 

wells fargo and certain of its subsidiary national banks including wells fargo bank na and wachovia bank na are participating in the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp which applies to us depository institutions insured by the fdic and us bank

future legislation 

in light of current conditions in the us and global financial markets and the us and global economy regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry proposals that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry are expected to be introduced in the us congress in state legislatures and from applicable regulatory authorities these proposals may change banking statutes and regulation and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

description of business 

general 

we are a diversified financial services company we provide retail commercial and corporate banking services through banking stores located in 23 states alaska arizona california colorado idaho illinois indiana iowa michigan minnesota montana nebraska nevada new mexico north dakota ohio oregon south dakota texas utah washington wisconsin and wyoming we provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses principally wholesale banking mortgage banking consumer finance equipment 

  leasing agricultural finance commercial finance securities brokerage and investment banking insurance agency and brokerage services computer and data processing services trust services investment advisory services mortgagebacked securities servicing and venture capital investment 

we have three operating segments for management reporting purposes community banking wholesale banking and wells fargo financial the 2007 annual report to stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments 

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

we describe below and in notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2007 annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and policies that are described banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole not investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions 

  general 

parent bank holding company as a bank holding company the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by its primary regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as a listed company on the new york stock exchange nyse the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies 

subsidiary banks our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and secondarily by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the frb our statechartered banks are subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the fdic and in addition are regulated and examined by their respective state banking departments 

nonbank subsidiaries many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies as well as the frb our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra and in some cases the municipal securities rulemaking board and state securities regulators finra was formed in july 2007 through a consolidation of the national association of securities dealers inc nasd and the member regulation enforcement and arbitration functions of the nyse finra is the largest nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the united states finra is responsible for rule writing firm examination enforcement arbitration and mediation functions previously overseen by the nasd our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states in which they conduct business 

parent bank holding company activities 

“financial in nature” requirement as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines from time to time to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity “complimentary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association 

  because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that any of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we would not be able to engage in any new activity or acquire companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those states 

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities 

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and principal and interest on its debt is dividends from its subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2007 annual report to stockholders 

  federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines 

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured in specified amounts a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

capital loans by the parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition in the event of the parent’s bankruptcy any commitment by the parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act fdi act provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 

  liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

capital requirements 

we are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb which are substantially similar to those imposed by the occ and the fdic on depository institutions within their jurisdictions under these guidelines a depository institution’s or a holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is classified into one of three tiers tier 1 capital includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock at the holding company level and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill and certain other deductions tier 2 capital includes among other things perpetual preferred stock not qualified as tier 1 capital subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations tier 3 capital includes qualifying unsecured subordinated debt at least onehalf of a bank’s total capital must qualify as tier 1 capital 

national banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain tier 1 capital and the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 respectively of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit the federal bank regulatory agencies may however set higher capital requirements for an individual bank or when a bank’s particular circumstances warrant the frb may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets also the frb considers a “tangible tier 1 leverage ratio” deducting all intangibles and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or engaging in new activities 

effective april 1 2002 the frb occ and fdic issued new rules that establish minimum capital requirements for equity investments in nonfinancial companies these rules impose a capital charge that increases incrementally as the level of nonfinancial equity investments increases relative to tier 1 capital these capital charges range from tier 1 capital charges of 8 to 25 of the adjusted carrying value of the nonfinancial equity investments 

the frb occ and fdic rules also require us to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into our regulatory capital computations under the market risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading activities 

  in june 2004 the basel committee on bank supervision published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital that are designed to be more risk sensitive than the existing framework and to promote enhanced risk management practices among large internationally active banking organizations the united states federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a final rule similar to the international guidelines in november 2007 this new advance capital adequacy framework is known as “basel ii” and is intended to more closely align regulatory capital requirements with actual risks basel ii incorporates three pillars that address a capital adequacy b supervisory review which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline through increased disclosure requirements embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy measurement and management that relate to credit risk market risk and operational risk banking organizations are required to enhance the measurement and management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for calculating riskbased capital requirements under the final rule banks subject to the rule must develop an implementation plan within six months of the rule’s effective date with the transitional period for capital calculation to begin within 36 months of the effective date of the final rule basel ii includes safeguards that include a requirement that banking organizations conduct a parallel run over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital under the new regulatory capital rules and the existing general riskbased capital rules before solely operating under the basel ii framework a requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before operating under basel ii without floors and a commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to ensure basel ii is working as intended the first possible year for a bank to begin its parallel run is 2008 following a successful parallel run period a banking organization would have to progress through three transitional periods each lasting at least one year during which there would be floors on potential declines in riskbased capital requirements as calculated under the current rules those transitional floors provide for maximum cumulative reductions of required riskbased capital of 5 during the first year of implementation 10 in the second year and 15 in the third year 2009 is the first possible year a bank may begin its first of the three transitional floor periods a banking organization will need approval from its primary federal regulator to move into each of the transitional floor periods and at the end of the third transitional floor period to move to full implementation we continue to analyze the basel ii capital standards and have established a project management infrastructure to address and meet the new regulations 

in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for banks that meet certain specified criteria including excellent asset quality high liquidity low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 4 our tier 1 and total riskbased capital ratios and leverage ratio as of december 31 2007 are included in note 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2007 annual report to stockholders 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions such proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

  as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

deposit insurance assessments 

our bank subsidiaries including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor the dif was formed march 31 2006 upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 the act established a range of 115 to 150 within which the fdic board of directors may set the designated reserve ratio drr the current target drr is 125 however the act has eliminated the restrictions on premium rates based on the drr and grants the fdic board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio 

to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on their deposits and their institutional risk category the fdic determines an institution’s risk category by combining its supervisory ratings with its financial ratios and other risk measures for large institutions assets of 10 billion or more the fdic generally determines risk by combining supervisory ratings with the institution’s longterm debt issuer ratings the fdic has established four risk categories with assessment rates for 2007 ranging from a minimum of 5 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for well managed well capitalized banks with the highest credit ratings to 43 cents for institutions posing the most risk to the dif the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule quarterly 

to offset assessments a member institution may apply certain one time credits based on the institution’s or its successor’s assessment base as of the end of 1996 an institution may apply available credits up to 100 of assessments in 2007 and up to 90 of assessments in each of 2008 2009 and 2010 based on available credits we did not incur a significant increase in total deposit insurance expense in 2007 under the new assessment schedule there is no assurance that after 2007 we will have sufficient credits to apply to deposit insurance assessments or that our assessment rate will not increase significantly which depending on the extent of change could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 

the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or 

  more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay an annual assessment to interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 114 to 122 cents per 100 of assessable deposits in 2007 the fdic established the fico assessment rate effective for the first quarter of 2008 at approximately 114 cents annually per 100 of assessable deposits this separate fico assessment cannot be offset with any one time credits 

fiscal and monetary policies 

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and restrictions on crossselling 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors 

federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act the fact act which have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers before information can be shared among different wells fargo companies for the purpose of crossselling wells fargo’s products and services this may result in certain crosssell programs being less effective than they have been in the past wells fargo must comply with these regulations no later than october 1 2008 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for 

  enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities and exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting the nyse has imposed a number of new corporate governance requirements as well 

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

future legislation 

various legislation including proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system is from time to time introduced in congress this legislation may change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted this legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

description of business 

general 

we are a diversified financial services company we provide retail commercial and corporate banking services through banking stores located in 23 states alaska arizona california 

  colorado idaho illinois indiana iowa michigan minnesota montana nebraska nevada new mexico north dakota ohio oregon south dakota texas utah washington wisconsin and wyoming we provide other financial services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses principally wholesale banking mortgage banking consumer finance equipment leasing agricultural finance commercial finance securities brokerage and investment banking insurance agency and brokerage services computer and data processing services trust services investment advisory services mortgagebacked securities servicing and venture capital investment 

we have three operating segments for management reporting purposes community banking wholesale banking and wells fargo financial the 2006 annual report to stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments 

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies and money market and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses and insurance companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

we describe below and in notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2006 annual report to stockholders the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and policies that are described banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and a change in them including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented could have a material effect on our business the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole not investors in bank holding companies such as the company 

statutes regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock they 

  may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions 

general 

parent bank holding company as a bank holding company the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by its primary regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the securities and exchange commission sec as a listed company on the new york stock exchange nyse the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies 

subsidiary banks our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and secondarily by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the frb our statechartered banks are subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the fdic and in addition are regulated and examined by their respective state banking departments 

nonbank subsidiaries many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the sec the national association of securities dealers inc nasd and state securities regulators our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies as well as the frb our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states in which they conduct business 

parent bank holding company activities 

“financial in nature” requirement as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines from time to time to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is not required for us to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association 

  because we are a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory we will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that we could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that any of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected we would not be able to engage in any new activity or acquire companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

we became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 we continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those states 

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities 

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and principal and interest on its debt is dividends from its subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval for information about the 

  restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2006 annual report to stockholders 

federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines 

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured in specified amounts a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

capital loans by the parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition in the event of the parent’s bankruptcy any commitment by the parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act fdi act provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails 

  insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 

liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

capital requirements 

we are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb which are substantially similar to those imposed by the occ and the fdic on depository institutions within their jurisdictions for information about these capital requirements and guidelines see note 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2006 annual report to stockholders 

the frb may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets also the frb considers a “tangible tier 1 leverage ratio” deducting all intangibles and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or engaging in new activities 

frb fdic and occ rules also require us to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into our regulatory capital computations under the market risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading activities 

the basel committee on banking supervision continues to evaluate certain aspects of the proposed new basel capital accord basel ii basel ii incorporates three pillars that address a capital adequacy b supervisory review which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline through increased disclosure requirements embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy measurement and management that relate to credit risk market risk and operational risk certain proposed approaches by the basel committee in basel ii may be considered complex 

basel ii is an enterprise wide initiative in wells fargo under current guidance the first opportunity for an institution in the united states to conduct a parallel run of basel ii would be january 2008 

  from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions such proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

deposit insurance assessments 

our bank subsidiaries including wells fargo bank na are members of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic through the dif the fdic insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor the dif was formed march 31 2006 upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 the act established a range of 115 to 150 within which the fdic board of directors may set the designated reserve ratio drr the current target drr is 125 however the act has eliminated the restrictions on premium rates based on the drr and grants the fdic board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio 

to maintain the dif member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on their deposits and their institutional risk category the fdic determines an institution’s risk category by combining its supervisory ratings with its financial ratios and other risk measures for large institutions assets of 10 billion or more the fdic generally determines risk by combining supervisory ratings with the institution’s longterm debt issuer ratings the fdic has established four risk categories with assessment rates for 2007 ranging from a minimum of 5 cents per 100 of domestic deposits for well managed well capitalized banks with the highest credit ratings to 43 cents for institutions posing the most risk to the dif the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule quarterly 

to offset assessments a member institution may apply certain one time credits based on the institution’s or its successor’s assessment base as of the end of 1996 an institution may apply available credits up to 100 of assessments in 2007 and up to 90 of assessments in each of 2008 2009 and 2010 based on available credits we do not expect to incur a significant increase in total deposit insurance expense in 2007 under the new assessment schedule 

  the fdic may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved 

all fdicinsured depository institutions must also pay an annual assessment to interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 13 cents per 100 of bifassessable deposits in 2006 the fdic established the fico assessment rate effective for the first quarter of 2007 at approximately 12 cents annually per 100 of assessable deposits this separate fico assessment cannot be offset with any one time credits 

fiscal and monetary policies 

our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws we are subject to sarbanesoxley because we are required to file periodic 

  reports with the sec under the securities and exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting the nyse has imposed a number of new corporate governance requirements as well 

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

future legislation 

various legislation including proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system is from time to time introduced in congress this legislation may change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted this legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition

the company had 153500 active fulltime equivalent team members at december 31 2005 

history and growth 

the company is the product of the merger involving norwest corporation and the former wells fargo  company completed on november 2 1998 the wfc merger on completion of the wfc merger norwest corporation changed its name to wells fargo  company 

norwest corporation was organized in 1929 under the laws of the state of delaware prior to the wfc merger it provided banking services to customers in 16 states and additional financial services through subsidiaries engaged in a variety of businesses including mortgage banking and consumer finance 

the former wells fargo  company’s principal subsidiary wells fargo bank na was the successor to the banking portion of the business founded by henry wells and william g fargo in 1852 that business later operated the westernmost leg of the pony express and ran stagecoach lines in the western part of the united states the california banking business was separated from the express business in 1905 merged in 1960 with american trust company another of the oldest banks in the western united states and became wells fargo bank na a national banking association in 1968 

in april 1996 the former wells fargo  company acquired first interstate bancorp a 55 billion bank holding company in a transaction valued at 11 billion in october 2000 the company acquired first security corporation a 23 billion bank holding company in a transaction valued at 3 billion 

the company expands its business in part by acquiring banking institutions and other companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature the company continues to explore opportunities to acquire banking institutions and other financial services companies and discussions are continually being carried on related to such possible acquisitions the company cannot predict whether or on what terms such discussions will result in further acquisitions as a matter of policy the company generally does not comment on such discussions or possible acquisitions until a definitive acquisition agreement has been signed 

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies and money market and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses and insurance companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures 

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which the company conducts business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 

regulation and supervision 

the following discussion together with notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2005 annual report to stockholders sets forth the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain information specific to us this regulatory framework is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole and not to protect security holders to the extent that the information describes statutory and regulatory provisions it is qualified in its entirety by reference to those provisions further such statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies a change in statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us including changes in interpretation or implementation thereof could have a material effect on the company’s business 

laws and regulations could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on our capital stock the company may also be required to provide financial support to one or more of its subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions 

general 

parent bank holding company as a bank holding company the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb 

subsidiary banks the company’s subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and secondarily by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the frb the company’s statechartered banks are subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the fdic and in addition are regulated and examined by their respective state banking departments 

nonbank subsidiaries many of the company’s nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies the company’s brokerage 

subsidiaries are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec the national association of securities dealers inc and state securities regulators the company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies the company’s other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government andor the various states in which they conduct business 

parent bank holding company activities 

“financial in nature” requirement as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines from time to time to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a safety and soundness risk 

frb approval is not required for the company to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval is required before the company may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association 

because the company is a financial holding company if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended cra of less than satisfactory the company will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that the company could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act in addition if the frb finds that any of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed the company would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions until corrected the company would not be able to engage in any new activity or acquire companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval if the company fails to correct any such condition within a prescribed period the frb could order the company to divest of its banking subsidiaries or in the alternative to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 

the company became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 it continues to maintain its status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations 

interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state 

the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those states 

regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the cra and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities 

dividend restrictions 

the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries a significant source of funds to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and principal and interest on its debt is dividends from its subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2005 annual report to stockholders 

federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines 

holding company structure 

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered 

transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured in specified amounts a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms 

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support 

the occ may order the assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency 

capital loans by the parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition in the event of the parent’s bankruptcy any commitment by the parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act fdi act provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 

liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the parent’s banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

capital requirements 

the company is subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb which are substantially similar to the capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb the occ and the fdic on depository institutions within their jurisdictions for information about these capital requirements and guidelines see note 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements included in the 2005 annual report to stockholders 

the frb may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets also the frb considers a “tangible tier 1 leverage ratio” deducting all intangibles and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or engaging in new activities 

frb fdic and occ rules also require the company to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into its regulatory capital computations under the market risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading activities 

the basel committee on banking supervision continues to evaluate certain aspects of the proposed new basel capital accord basel ii basel ii incorporates three pillars that address a capital adequacy b supervisory review which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes and c market discipline through increased disclosure requirements embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy measurement and management that relate to credit risk market risk and operational risk certain proposed approaches by the basel committee in basel ii may be considered complex 

federal banking agencies expect that their revised proposal for us implementation of basel ii will be available in mid2006 under the revised timeline the first opportunity for an institution to conduct a parallel run of basel ii with existing basel i capital requirement calculations would be january 2008 

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions such proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect the company’s reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure 

and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 

deposit insurance assessments 

through the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the fdic insures the deposits of the company’s depository institution subsidiaries up to prescribed limits for each depositor the amount of fdic assessments paid by a bif and saif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors specifically the assessment rate is based on the institution’s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category an institution’s capitalization risk category is based on the fdic’s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized an institution’s supervisory subgroup category is based on the fdic’s assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be required 

the bif and saif assessment rate currently ranges from zero to 27 cents per 100 of domestic deposits the bif and saif assessment rate for the company’s depository institutions currently is zero the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semiannual basis an increase in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on the company’s earnings depending on the amount of the increase the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of the company’s subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s earnings depending on the collective size of the particular institutions involved 

all fdicinsured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 14 cents per 100 of bifassessable deposits in 2005 the fdic established the fico assessment rate effective for the first quarter of 2006 at approximately 13 cents annually per 100 of assessable deposits 

in december 2005 congress passed legislation that contained a deposit insurance reform provision the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 will merge bif and saif into a new deposit insurance fund dif the legislation also authorized the fdic to revise the current riskbased assessment system described above because the fdic has not yet proposed these revisions the company cannot predict the effect they may have on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

fiscal and monetary policies 

the company’s business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies the company is particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act 

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors 

sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sarbanesoxley implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws the company is subject to sarbanesoxley because it is required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities and exchange act of 1934 among other things sarbanesoxley andor its implementing regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee imposed restrictions on the relationship between the company and its outside auditors including restrictions on the types of nonaudit services our auditors may provide to us imposed additional responsibilities for our 

external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders required our management to evaluate the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting the new york stock exchange has imposed a number of new corporate governance requirements as well 

patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts the patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act requires the company to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

future legislation 

various legislation including proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system is from time to time introduced in congress this legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted this legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions the company cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition

for example in our 2005 annual report to stockholders we make forwardlooking statements about 

 

 

our ability to grow revenue and earnings will suffer if we are unable to crosssell more products to customers 

selling more products to our customers – or “crossselling” – is the essence of our business model and key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings many of our competitors also focus on crossselling especially in retail banking and mortgage lending this can put pressure on us to sell our products at lower prices reducing our net interest income and revenue from our feebased products it could also affect our ability to keep existing customers new technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers increasing our crosssell ratio – or the average number of products sold to existing customers – may become more challenging and we might not attain our goal of selling an average of eight products to each customer 

an economic slowdown could reduce demand for our products and services and lead to lower revenue and lower earnings 

we earn revenue from interest and fees we charge on the loans and other products and services we sell when the economy slows the demand for those products and services can fall reducing our interest and fee income and our earnings an economic downturn can also hurt the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans causing us to incur more credit losses than we estimated several factors could cause the economy to slow down or even recede including higher energy costs higher interest rates reduced consumer or corporate spending natural disasters such as hurricane katrina terrorist activities military conflicts and the normal cyclical nature of the economy 

changes in stock market prices could reduce fee income from our brokerage and asset management businesses 

we earn fee income from managing assets for others and providing brokerage services because investment management fees are often based on the value of assets under management a fall in the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors reducing commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage business 

for more information refer to “risk management – assetliability and market risk management – market riskequity markets” in the financial review section of our 2005 annual report to stockholders 

changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings 

our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans debt securities and other assets we hold minus the interest we pay on our deposits longterm and shortterm debt and other liabilities net interest income reflects both our net interest margin – the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding – and the amount of earning assets we hold as a result changes in either our net interest margin or the amount of earning assets we hold could affect our net interest income and our earnings 

changes in interest rates – up or down – could adversely affect our net interest margin although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates one can rise or fall faster than the other causing our net interest margin to expand or contract our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates as a result when interest rates rise our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up 

changes in the slope of the “yield curve” – or the spread between shortterm and longterm interest rates – could also reduce our net interest margin normally the yield curve is upward sloping meaning shortterm rates are lower than longterm rates because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets when the yield curve flattens or even inverts we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets 

we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve we hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives we also rely on the “natural hedge” that our loan originations and servicing rights can provide 

we do not hedge all of our interest rate risk there is always the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and our earnings in material amounts especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed for example if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments to reduce our interest rate risk we may rebalance our investment and loan portfolios refinance our debt and take other strategic actions we may incur losses or expenses when we take such actions 

for more information refer to “risk management – assetliability and market risk management – interest rate risk” in the financial review section of our 2005 annual report to stockholders 

changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our mortgage servicing rights and earnings 

we have a sizeable portfolio of mortgage servicing rights a mortgage servicing right msr is the right to service a mortgage loan – collect principal interest escrow amounts etc – for a fee we acquire msrs when we originate mortgage loans and keep the servicing rights after we sell or securitize the loans or when we purchase the servicing rights to mortgage loans originated by other lenders we carry msrs at the lower of cost or fair value fair value is the present value of estimated future net servicing income calculated based on a number of variables including assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers 

changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair value when interest rates fall borrowers are more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate as the likelihood of prepayment increases the fair value of our msrs can decrease each quarter we evaluate our msrs for impairment based on the difference between carrying amount and fair value at quarter end if temporary impairment exists we establish a valuation allowance through a charge to earnings for the amount the carrying amount exceeds fair value we also evaluate our msrs for otherthantemporary impairment if we determine that permanent impairment exists we will recognize a direct writedown of the carrying value of the msrs 

for more information refer to “critical accounting policies – valuation of mortgage servicing rights” and “risk management – assetliability and market risk management – mortgage banking interest rate risk” in the financial review section of our 2005 annual report to stockholders 

higher credit losses could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses through a charge to earnings 

when we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans we reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings the amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including unfunded credit commitments the process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition it requires difficult subjective and complex judgments about the future including forecasts of economic conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 

we might underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount reserved we might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions for example in a rising interest rate environment borrowers with adjustable rate loans could see their payments increase in the absence of offsetting factors such as increased economic activity and higher wages this could reduce their ability to repay their loans resulting 

in our increasing the allowance we might also increase the allowance because of unexpected events as we did in third quarter 2005 for hurricane katrina 

hurricane katrina has affected our loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral and by impairing the ability of certain borrowers to repay their loans the ultimate impact of the hurricane on us is difficult to predict and will be affected by a number of factors including the extent of damage to the collateral the extent to which damaged collateral is not covered by insurance the extent to which unemployment and other economic conditions caused by the hurricane adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the cost to us of collection and foreclosure moratoriums loan forbearances and other accommodations granted to borrowers and other customers the impact of the hurricane on us may be greater than anticipated 

for more information refer to “critical accounting policies – allowance for credit losses” and “risk management – credit risk management process” in the financial review section of our 2005 annual report to stockholders 

our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter 

we earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans when rates rise the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations at the same time revenue from our msrs can increase either through recovery of a previously established valuation allowance or a reduction in the periodic amortization expense when rates fall mortgage originations tend to increase and the value of our msrs tends to decline also with some offsetting revenue effect even though they can act as a “natural hedge” the hedge is not perfect either in amount or timing for example the negative effect on revenue from an increase in the msrs valuation allowance is immediate but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the msrs relating to the new loans would accrue over time 

from time to time we may use derivatives and other instruments to hedge our mortgage banking interest rate risk we generally do not hedge all of our risk and the fact that we attempt to hedge any of the risk does not mean we will be successful hedging is a complex process requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring and is not a perfect science we may use hedging instruments tied to us treasury rates or libor that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged we could incur losses from our hedging activities there may be periods where we elect not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk 

for more information refer to “risk management – assetliability and market risk management – mortgage banking interest rate risk” in the financial review section of our 2005 annual report to stockholders 

our venture capital business can also be volatile from quarter to quarter 

earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and hard to predict and can have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period when – and if – we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions the prospects of the companies in which we invest when these companies go public the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions our venture capital investments could result in significant losses 

we assess our private and public equity portfolio at least quarterly for otherthantemporary impairment based on a number of factors including the then current market value of each investment compared to its carrying value our venture capital investments tend to be in technology telecommunications and other volatile industries so the value of our public and private equity portfolios can fluctuate widely if we determine there is otherthantemporary impairment for an investment we will writedown the carrying value of the investment resulting in a charge to earnings the amount of this charge could be significant especially if under accounting rules we were required previously to writeup the value because of higher market prices 

for more information refer to “risk management – assetliability and market risk management – market riskequity markets” in the financial review section of our 2005 annual report to stockholders 

we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for revenue and federal and state law can limit those dividends 

wells fargo  company the parent holding company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries it receives a significant portion of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries we use these dividends to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends that our bank and some of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to us also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

for more information refer to “regulation and supervision – dividend restrictions” and “– holding company structure” in this report and to notes 3 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements in our 2005 annual report to stockholders 

changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 

our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and condition some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results three of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions for a description of these three policies refer to “critical accounting policies” in the financial review section of our 2005 annual report to stockholders 

from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements these changes are beyond our control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial results and condition we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts 

acquisitions could reduce our stock price upon announcement and reduce our earnings if we overpay or have difficulty integrating them 

we regularly explore opportunities to acquire companies in the financial services industry we cannot predict the frequency size or timing of our acquisitions and we typically do not comment publicly on a possible acquisition until we have signed a definitive agreement when we do announce an acquisition our stock price may fall depending on the size of the acquisition and the purchase price it is also possible that an acquisition could dilute earnings per share 

we must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire a bank or bank holding company in deciding whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the community reinvestment act and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering also we cannot be certain when or if or on what terms and conditions any required regulatory approvals will be granted we might be required to sell banks branches andor business units as a condition to receiving regulatory approval 

difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence and other projected benefits from the acquisition the integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition run 

off loss of key employees disruption of our business or the business of the acquired company or otherwise harm our ability to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition time and resources spent on integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing businesses also the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected 

federal and state regulations can restrict our business and noncompliance could result in penalties litigation and damage to our reputation 

our parent company our subsidiary banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries are heavily regulated at the federal andor state levels this regulation is to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds consumers and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders federal and state regulations can significantly restrict our businesses and we could be fined or otherwise penalized if we are found to be out of compliance 

recent highprofile corporate scandals and other events have resulted in additional regulations for example sarbanesoxley limits the types of nonaudit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve the independence of our auditors from us if our auditors were found not to be “independent” of us under sec rules we could be required to engage new auditors and file new financial statements and audit reports with the sec we could be out of compliance with sec rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse consequences 

sarbanesoxley also requires our management to evaluate the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting we are required to disclose in our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec the existence of any “material weaknesses” in our internal control we cannot assure that we will not find one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given year nor can we predict the effect on our stock price of disclosure of a material weakness 

the patriot act which was enacted in the wake of the september 2001 terrorist attacks requires us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers the patriot act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition 

a number of states have recently challenged the position of the occ as the sole regulator of national banks if these challenges are successful or if congress acts to give greater effect to state regulation the impact on us could be significant not only because of the potential additional restrictions on our businesses but also from having to comply with potentially 50 different sets of regulations 

from time to time congress considers legislation that could significantly change our regulatory environment potentially increasing our cost of doing business limiting the activities we may pursue or affecting the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions as an example our business model depends on sharing information among the family of wells fargo businesses to better satisfy our customers’ needs laws that restrict the ability of our companies to share information about customers could limit our ability to crosssell products and services reducing our revenue and earnings 

for more information refer to “regulation and supervision” in this report and to “report of independent registered public accounting firm” in our 2005 annual report to stockholders 

negative publicity could damage our reputation 

reputation risk or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion is inherent in our business negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and expose us to adverse legal and regulatory consequences negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including lending practices corporate governance regulatory compliance mergers and acquisitions and disclosure sharing or inadequate protection of customer information and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct because we conduct most of our businesses under the “wells fargo” brand negative public opinion about one business could affect our other businesses 

our bank customers could take their money out of the bank and put it in alternative investments causing us to lose a lower cost source of funding 

checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments such as the stock market as providing a better riskreturn tradeoff when customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments we can lose a relatively low cost source of funds increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income 

we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 

in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we rely on the accuracy and completeness of information about our customers including financial statements and other financial information and reports of independent auditors for example in deciding whether to extend credit we may assume that a customer’s audited financial statements conform with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and present fairly in all material respects the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the customer we also may rely on the 

audit report covering those financial statements if that information is incorrect or incomplete we may incur credit losses or other charges to earnings 

we rely on others to help us with our operations 

we rely on outside vendors to provide key components of our business operations such as internet connections and network access disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor or any failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes of use could hurt our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business financial or operational difficulties of an outside vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor’s ability to serve us 

federal reserve board policies can significantly impact business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition 

the federal reserve board frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments both of which affect our net interest margin they also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold such as debt securities and msrs its policies also can affect our borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans changes in frb policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict 

our stock price can be volatile due to other factors 

our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors in addition to those described above including 

 

analysis of changes in net interest income 

the following table allocates the changes in net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis to changes in either average balances or average rates for both interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period it is not possible to precisely allocate such changes between volume and rate for this table changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated to these categories in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate 

 

 

 

loan portfolio 

loan concentrations may exist when there are borrowers engaged in similar activities or types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that could cause those borrowers or portfolios to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 

our real estate 14 family mortgage loans to borrowers in the state of california represented approximately 14 of total loans at december 31 2005 compared with 18 at the end of 2004 these loans are mostly within the larger metropolitan areas in california with no single area consisting of more than 3 of our total loans changes in real estate values and underlying economic conditions for these areas are monitored continuously within the credit risk management process 

some of our real estate 14 family mortgage loans including first mortgage and home equity products include an interestonly feature as part of the loan terms at december 31 2005 such loans were approximately 26 of total loans compared with 28 at the end of 2004 substantially all of these loans are considered to be prime or near prime we do not offer option adjustablerate mortgage products nor do we offer variablerate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans

fargo in 1852 that business later operated the westernmost leg of the pony express and ran stagecoach lines in the western part of the united states the california banking business was separated from the express business in 1905 was merged in 1960 with american trust company another of the oldest banks in the western united states and became wells fargo bank na a national banking association in 1968 the former wells fargo  company acquired first interstate bancorp in april 1996 first interstate’s assets had an approximate book value of 55 billion the transaction was valued at approximately 113 billion and was accounted for as a purchase the company expands its business in part by acquiring banking institutions and other companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature the company continues to explore opportunities to acquire banking institutions and other financial services companies discussions are continually being carried on related to such possible acquisitions the company cannot predict whether or on what terms such discussions will result in further acquisitions as a matter of policy the company generally does not comment on such discussions or possible acquisitions until a definitive acquisition agreement has been signed competition the financial services industry is highly competitive the company’s subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies and money market and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses and insurance companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions acquisitions of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which the company conducts business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the 3   importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties regulation and supervision the following discussion together with notes 4 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements sets forth the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain information specific to the company this regulatory framework is intended to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not to protect security holders to the extent that the information describes statutory and regulatory provisions it is qualified in its entirety by reference to those provisions further such statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies a change in statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the company including changes in interpretation or implementation thereof could have a material effect on the company’s business applicable laws and regulations could restrict the company’s ability to diversify into other areas of financial services acquire depository institutions and pay dividends on the company’s capital stock they could also require the company to provide financial support to one or more of its subsidiary banks maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions general parent bank holding company as a bank holding company the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection examination and supervision by the board

nature” requirement as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury determines from time to time to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a safety and soundness risk a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and such other activities as determined by the frb to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto federal reserve board approval is not required for the company to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval is required before the company may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association because the company is a financial holding company if any subsidiary bank of the company ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb may among other actions order the company to divest the subsidiary bank alternatively the company may elect to restrict the company’s activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company also because the company is a financial holding company if any subsidiary bank of the company receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 of less than satisfactory the company will be prohibited until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies banks or savings associations except that the company could engage in new activities or acquire companies engaged in activities that are closely related to banking under the bhc act the company became a financial holding company effective march 13 2000 it continues to maintain its status as a bank holding company for purposes of other frb regulations interstate banking  under the riegleneal interstate banking and branching act riegleneal act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state more than 30 of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state 5   the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish de novo branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those states regulatory approval in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition the projected capital ratios and levels on a postacquisition basis and the acquiring institution’s record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves including the needs of low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank under the community reinvestment act of 1977 as amended dividend restrictions the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries its principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and principal and interest on its debt is dividends from its subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent’s subsidiary banks see note 4 cash loan and dividend restrictions to financial statements federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the ability of the parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines holding company structure transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled “covered transactions” in general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit investments and asset purchases as well as other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus also loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured in specified amounts a bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms source of strength the frb has a policy that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be 6   required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support the occ may order the assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency capital loans by the parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition in the event of the parent’s bankruptcy any commitment by the parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act fdi act provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the parent’s banks are insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company “default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver “in danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance capital requirements the parent is subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb which are substantially similar to the capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb the occ and the fdic on depository institutions within their jurisdictions for information about these capital requirements and guidelines see note 26 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements the frb may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets also the frb considers a “tangible tier 1 leverage ratio” deducting all intangibles and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or engaging in new activities 7   effective april 1 2002 the frb occ and fdic issued new rules governing the capital treatment of nonfinancial equity investments which includes investments made by the company’s venture capital subsidiaries the rules impose a capital charge that increases incrementally as the level of nonfinancial equity investments increases relative to tier 1 capital for covered investments that total less than 15 of tier 1 capital the rules require a tier 1 capital charge of 8 of the adjusted carrying value of the covered investments for covered investments that total 15 or more but less than 25 the tier 1 capital charge is 12 and for covered investments that total 25 or more the tier 1 capital charge is 25 the new rules have not had a material impact on the company frb fdic and occ rules also require the company to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into its regulatory capital computations under the market risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading activities the basel committee on banking supervision continues to evaluate certain aspects of the proposed new basel capital accord with the goal of finalizing the accord by the fourth quarter of 2003 with anticipated implementation by 2006 the new basel capital accord incorporates three pillars that address a minimum capital requirements b supervisory review which relates to an institution’s capital adequacy and internal assessment process and c market discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking practices embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk assessment that relate to credit risk interest rate risk operational risk among others and certain proposed approaches by the basel committee to complete such assessments may be considered complex the company continues to monitor the status of the new basel accord from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital guidelines and related reporting instructions such proposals or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect the company’s reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements a depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 8   deposit insurance assessments through the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the fdic insures the deposits of the parent’s depository institution subsidiaries up to prescribed limits for each depositor the amount of fdic assessments paid by bif and saif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors specifically the assessment rate is based on the institution’s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category an institution’s capitalization risk category is based on the fdic’s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized an institution’s supervisory subgroup category is based on the fdic’s assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be required the bif and saif assessment rate currently ranges from zero to 27 cents per 100 of domestic deposits the bif assessment rate for the parent’s depository institutions currently is zero the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semiannual basis an increase in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on the parent’s earnings depending on the amount of the increase the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of the parent’s subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse effect on the parent’s earnings depending on the collective size of the particular institutions involved all fdicinsured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 18 cents per 100 of bifassessable deposits in 2002 the fdic established the fico assessment rate effective for the first quarter of 2003 at approximately 17 cents annually per 100 of assessable deposits fiscal and monetary policies the company’s business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies the company is particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 9   privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors future legislation various legislation including proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system is from time to time introduced in congress this legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted this legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions the company cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 10   financial review overview wells fargo  company is a 349 billion diversified financial services

15   critical accounting policies the company’s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company has identified three policies as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions these policies relate to the allowance for loan losses the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and pension accounting the company in consultation with the audit and examination committee has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies further described in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements allowance for loan losses the company’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable and estimable credit losses inherent in the portfolio including unfunded commitments additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses or loan recoveries while chargeoffs are deducted from the allowance process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on a number of analytical tools and benchmarks to arrive at a range of probable outcomes no single statistic or measurement in itself determines the adequacy of the allowance for analytical purposes the allowance consists of two components allocated and unallocated to arrive at the allocated component of the allowance the company combines estimates of the allowances needed for loans analyzed individually and loans analyzed on a pooled basis the determination of the allocated allowance for portfolios of commercial and real estate loans involves the use of a continuous and standardized loan grading process in combination with a review of larger individual higherrisk transactions the company grades loans and assigns a loss factor to each pool of loans based on the grades the loss factors used for this analysis are derived in two ways first migration models are used to determine loss factors by tracking actual portfolio movements between loan grades over the loss emergence period of these portfolios second in the case of graded loans without identified credit weaknesses the loss factors are estimated using a combination of longterm average loss experience of the company’s own graded portfolios and external industry data in addition the company analyzes nonperforming loans over 1 million individually for impairment using a cash flow or collateral based methodology calculated impairment is included in the allocated allowance unless impairment has been recognized as a loss 16   in the case of homogeneous portfolios such as consumer loans and leases residential mortgage loans and some segments of small business loans the determination of the allocated allowance is conducted at an aggregate or pooled level for such portfolios the risk assessment process includes the use of forecasting models to measure inherent loss in these portfolios such analyses are updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios as well as any changes in the company’s loss mitigation or customer solicitation strategies in order to reduce the differences between estimated and observed losses to mitigate imprecision and incorporate the range of probable outcomes inherent in estimates of expected credit losses the allocated component of the allowance is supplemented by an unallocated component the unallocated component also incorporates the company’s judgmental determination of risks inherent in portfolio composition economic uncertainties and other subjective factors including industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments that have not yet resulted in changes in individual loan grades therefore the ratio of the allocated to the unallocated components within the total allowance for loan losses may fluctuate from period to period the allocated and unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that would adequately cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio the determination of the level of the allowance and correspondingly the provision for loan losses rests upon various judgments and assumptions including 1 general economic conditions 2 loan portfolio composition 3 prior loan loss experience 4 management’s evaluation of credit risk related to both individual borrowers and pools of loans 5 periodic use of sensitivity analysis and expected loss simulation modeling and 6 observations derived from the company’s ongoing internal audit and examination processes and those of its regulators the assumptions below were used to estimate a range of the 2002 allowance outcomes and related changes in provision expense assuming either a reasonably possible deterioration in loan credit quality or a reasonably possible improvement in loan credit quality assumptions for deterioration in loan credit quality   assumptions for improvement in loan credit quality  17    these assumptions would result in a potential of 500 million in additional expected losses to emerge in the portfolio under the deterioration in loan credit quality scenario and a potential of a 350 million reduction to expected losses to emerge in the portfolio under the improvement in loan credit quality scenario changes in the estimate related to the allowance for loan losses can materially affect net income this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios the process of determining the allowance requires us to forecast losses on loans in the future which are highly uncertain and require a high degree of judgment and is impacted by regional national and global economic trends and different assumptions regarding “reasonably possible” future economic conditions could have been used and would have had a material impact on the provision for loan losses and on the consolidated results of operations 18   mortgage servicing rights valuation the company recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others known as mortgage servicing rights msrs whether the servicing rights are acquired through purchases or retained upon sale or securitization of originated loans generally purchased msrs are capitalized at the cost to acquire the rights originated msrs are capitalized based on the relative fair value of the servicing right and the mortgage loan on the date the mortgage loan is sold purchased and originated msrs are carried at the lower of the capitalized amount net of accumulated amortization and hedge accounting adjustments or fair value for msrs designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge under fasb statement no 133 fas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from the application of hedge accounting if the msrs carrying value is adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from the application of hedge accounting the adjustment becomes part of the carrying value which is still subject to a fair value test in accordance with fasb statement no 140 fas 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  msrs are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income the amortization of the msrs is analyzed periodically and is adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment speeds and discount rates to determine the fair value of msrs the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income in using this valuation method the company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income which include estimates of prepayment speeds discount rate cost to service escrow account earnings contractual servicing fee income ancillary income late fees and float income the valuation of msrs is discussed further in this section and in notes 1 summary of significant accounting policies 22 securitizations and 23 mortgage banking activities to financial statements each quarter the company evaluates the possible impairment of msrs based on the difference between the carrying amount and current fair value of the msrs in accordance with fas 140 for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment the company stratifies its portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics including loan type and note rate if temporary impairment exists a valuation allowance is established for any excess of amortized cost over the current fair value by risk stratification tranche through a charge to income if the company later determines that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income the company has a policy of reviewing msrs for otherthantemporary impairment each quarter and recognizes a direct writedown when the recoverability of a recorded valuation allowance is determined to be remote in determining whether otherthantemporary impairment has occurred the company considers both historical and projected trends in interest rates pay off activity and the potential for impairment recovery through interest rate increases unlike a valuation allowance a direct writedown permanently reduces the carrying value of the msrs and the valuation allowance precluding subsequent reversals 19   to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations the company hedges the change in value of its msrs with derivative financial instruments to the extent that hedge instruments are highly effective any reduction or increase in the value of the mortgage servicing asset is generally offset by gains or losses in the value of the derivative instrument to the extent that the reduction or increase in the value of the msrs is not offset the company immediately recognizes either a gain or loss for the amount of derivative ineffectiveness the company does not fully hedge msrs because its origination volume is a “natural hedge” ie as interest rates decline origination volume increases even though servicing values decrease conversely as interest rates increase origination volumes decline but the value of servicing increases servicing fees net of amortization impairment and gain or loss on the ineffective portion and the excluded portion of the derivative financial instruments are recorded as a component of mortgage banking noninterest income the company uses a dynamic and sophisticated model to estimate the value of its servicing asset loan prepayment speed is a key assumption in the valuation model and represents the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal the discount rate is another key assumption in the valuation model and is equal to what the company believes would be the required rate of return for an asset with similar risk the discount rate considers the risk premium for uncertainties associated with servicing operations eg possible changes in future servicing costs ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts both variables can and generally will change in quarterly and annual valuations as market conditions and projected interest rates change all assumptions are reviewed quarterly by senior management at december 31 2002 key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of msrs to an immediate adverse change in those assumptions are presented in the table on the next page 20   table 3 fair value of mortgage servicing rights  

 

 in recent years there have been significant market driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and the discount rate appropriate for msrs also loan prepayment speeds and the market discount rate could fluctuate rapidly and significantly in the future accordingly estimating prepayment speeds within a range that market participants would use in determining the fair value of msrs requires significant management judgment pension accounting there are four key variables utilized in the calculation of the company’s annual pension cost 1 size of the employee population 2 actuarial assumptions 3 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and 4 discount rate size of the employee population the amount of pension expense is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plan the population of employees eligible for pension benefits has steadily increased over the last few years causing a proportional growth in pension expense actuarial assumptions in estimating the projected benefit obligation actuaries must make assumptions about such factors as mortality rate turnover rate retirement rate disability rate and the rate of compensation increases because these factors do not tend to change over time the range of actuarial assumptions is generally narrow consequently pension plan expense is relatively insensitive to actuarial assumptions expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in accordance with fasb statement no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  the company calculates the expected return on plan assets each year based on the balance in the pension asset portfolio at the beginning of the plan year and the expected longterm rate of return on that 21   portfolio the expected longterm rate of return is designed to approximate the longterm rate of return actually earned on the plan assets over time and the expected longterm rate of return is generally held constant so that the pattern of incomeexpense recognition more closely matches the stable pattern of services provided by the company’s employees over the life of the pension obligation in determining the reasonableness of the expected rate of return a variety of factors are considered including the actual return earned on plan assets historical rates of return on the various asset classes of which the plan portfolio is comprised independent projections of returns on various asset classes and currentprospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts the company has used an expected rate of return of 9 on plan assets in each of the past six years over the last two decades the plan assets have actually earned a rate of return higher than 9 although the return in the last three years was lower differences in each year if any between expected and actual returns in excess of a 5 corridor are amortized in the net periodic pension calculation over five years see note 16 employee benefits and other expenses to financial statements for details on the company’s changes in pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets based on the pension asset and projected benefit obligation balances as of november 30 2002 the company’s measurement date if the company were to assume a 1 increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return holding the discount rate and other actuarial assumptions constant pension expense would decreaseincrease by approximately 27 million discount rate the discount rate is the rate used to determine the present value of the company’s future benefit obligations it is an assumption that reflects the rates available on longterm highquality fixedincome debt instruments reset annually on the measurement date of each year the company lowered its discount rate in 2002 to 7 from 75 which was the rate used in 19992001 if the company were to assume a 1 increasedecrease in the discount rate holding the expected longterm rate of return and other actuarial assumptions constant pension expense would decreaseincrease by approximately 65 million 22   earnings performance net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income which includes yieldrelated loan fees and interest expense net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis was 1459 billion in 2002 compared with 1205 billion in 2001 an increase of 21 net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis expressed as a percentage of average total earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin which represents the average net effective yield on earning assets for 2002 the net interest margin was 553 compared with 529 in 2001 in 2002 deposit and borrowing costs declined faster than declines in loans and debt securities yields due to the falling interest rate environment earning assets increased 358 billion in 2002 from 2001 predominantly due to increases in average loans and mortgages held for sale loans averaged 1745 billion in 2002 compared with 1572 billion in 2001 the increase was predominantly due to growth in mortgage and home equity products average mortgages held for sale increased to 399 billion in 2002 from 237 billion in 2001 the increase was due to increased originations including refinancing activity the increases were partially offset by a slowdown in commercial loan demand consistent with conditions in the current us economy debt securities available for sale averaged 360 billion in 2002 compared with 367 billion in 2001 an important contributor to the growth in net interest income and the net interest margin from 2001 was a 10 increase in average core deposits the company’s lowcost source of funding average core deposits were 1841 billion and 1679 billion and funded 572 and 589 of the company’s average total assets in 2002 and 2001 respectively while savings certificates of deposits declined on average from 299 billion to 243 billion noninterestbearing checking accounts and other core deposit categories increased on average from 1381 billion in 2001 to 1599 billion in 2002 reflecting a combination of growth in mortgage escrow deposits resulting from higher origination volume and growth in primary account relationships total average interestbearing deposits increased to 1338 billion in 2002 from 1202 billion a year ago for the same period total average noninterestbearing

normally structured as sales in accordance with fas 140 which involve the transfer of financial assets to certain qualifying specialpurpose entities that are not subject to consolidation in a securitization an entity transferring the assets is able to convert those assets into cash before they would have been realized by holding the assets to maturity specialpurpose entities used in such securitizations obtain cash to acquire the assets by issuing securities to investors in a securitization transaction the company customarily provides for representations and warranties with respect to the receivables transferred in addition the terms of the transaction generally provide for the company to retain the right to service the transferred receivables and to repurchase those receivables from the specialpurpose entity if the outstanding balance of the receivable falls to a level where the cost of servicing such receivables exceeds the benefits of servicing in addition the company may structure investment vehicles typically in the form of collateralized debt obligations which are sold in the market place at december 31 2002 the company’s securitization arrangements were comprised of approximately 453 billion in securitized loan receivables including 265 billion of residential mortgage loans the company retained servicing rights and other beneficial interests related to these securitizations of approximately 655 million consisting of 288 million in securities 99 million in servicing assets and 268 million in other retained interests with respect to these securitizations the company provided 85 million in liquidity commitments in the form of demand notes and reserve fund balances and had committed to provide up to 22 million in credit enhancements in january 2003 the fasb issued fin 46 consolidation of variable interest entities  which clarifies those entities that may be subject to consolidation because certain arrangements as defined in fin 46 may be controlled by financial interests in such entities referred to as “variable interest entities” vies that may not be controlled through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks such financial interests that convey economic risks and rewards associated with another entity can derive from relationships such as loans leases service contracts credit enhancements guarantees derivatives and call options an enterprise will be required to consolidate a variable interest entity if that enterprise has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses if they occur or receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur or both the adoption of fin 46 will not affect the company’s accounting for securitization transactions involving qualifying specialpurpose entities however the company believes that it is reasonably possible that it could be a significant or majority variable interest holder in certain transactions involving vies the aggregate amount of assets with respect to these transactions approximated 12 billion at december 31 2002 and the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these vies is approximately 45 million which approximated the company’s variable interests in these entities at the end of 2002 34

commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the company for additional information see note 6 loans and allowance for loan losses to financial statements in the company’s venture capital and capital markets businesses commitments are made to fund equity investments directly to investment funds and to specific private companies the timing of future cash requirements to fund such commitments is generally dependent upon the venture capital investment cycle this cycle the period over which privatelyheld companies are funded by venture capital investors and ultimately taken public through an initial offering can vary based on overall market conditions as well as the nature and type of industry in which the companies operate it is anticipated that many such private equity investments would become public or otherwise become liquid before the balance of unfunded equity commitments is utilized at december 31 2002 such commitments totaled approximately 880 million other investment commitments comprised principally of lowincome housing civic and other 35   community development initiatives undertaken by the company totaled

 the company anticipates changes in the amount of nonaccrual loans that result from increases in lending activity or from resolutions of loans in the nonaccrual portfolio the performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as economic conditions or factors particular to a borrower such as actions taken by a borrower’s management in addition from time to time the company purchases loans from other financial institutions that may be classified as nonaccrual based on the company’s policies 39   the company generally identifies loans to be evaluated for impairment under fasb statement no 114 fas 114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  when such loans are on nonaccrual however not all nonaccrual loans are impaired a loan is placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal unless both wellsecured and in the process of collection when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when a portion of the principal balance has been charged off real estate 14 family loans first and junior liens are placed on nonaccrual status within 120 days of becoming past due as to interest or principal regardless of security in contrast under fas 114 loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement including scheduled interest payments for loans covered under fas 114 the company assesses for impairment when such loans are on nonaccrual or when the loan has been restructured when a loan over 1 million with unique risk characteristics has been identified as impaired the company estimates the amount of impairment using discounted cash flows except when the sole remaining source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral in such cases the current fair value of the collateral reduced by costs to sell will be used in place of discounted cash flows if the measurement of the impaired loan results in a value that is less than the recorded investment in the loan including accrued interest net deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount an impairment is recognized through the allowance for loan losses fas 114 does not change the timing of chargeoffs of loans to reflect the amount ultimately expected to be collected if interest that was due on the book balances of all nonaccrual loans including loans that were but are no longer on nonaccrual at year end had been accrued under their original terms 107 million of interest would have been recorded in 2002 compared with 41 million actually recorded foreclosed assets at december 31 2002 were 195 million compared with 160

shows loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal but are not included in table 10 nonaccrual loans and other assets risk management credit risk management process the company’s credit risk management is an integrated process that stresses decentralized line of business group management and accountability supported by the chief credit officer’s oversight consistent credit policies and frequent and comprehensive risk measurement and modeling the process is also reviewed regularly by the company’s loan examiners and internal audit and is subject to examination by external auditors and regulators credit risk including counterparty risk is managed within the framework and guidance of comprehensive companywide policies credit policies are in place for all banking and nonbanking operations that have exposure to credit risk these policies provide a consistent and prudent approach to credit risk management across the enterprise actual credit performance and exception rates are measured through detailed tracking and analysis and credit policies are routinely reviewed andor modified as appropriate the chief credit officer provides companywide credit oversight each business group with credit risks has a designated credit officer and has the primary responsibility for managing that risk the chief credit officer delegates authority limits and requirements to the business units these delegations are reviewed and amended in the event of significant changes in personnel or credit performance all portfolios of credit risk are subject to periodic reviews to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that credit standards are followed such reviews are conducted by the business units themselves and by the office of the chief credit officer in addition all such portfolios are subject to the independent review of the company’s loan examiners andor internal audit quarterly asset quality forecasts are completed to quantify each business group’s intermediateterm outlook for loan losses and recoveries nonperforming loans and market trends periodic stress tests are conducted to validate the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses including a portfolio loss simulation model that simulates the allowance requirement of the company’s various subportfolios assuming various trends in loan quality loan portfolios are assessed for geographic or industry concentrations and mitigation strategies are developed in addition the company routinely reviews and evaluates downside scenarios for risks that are not borrower specific but that may influence the behavior of a particular credit group of credits or entire subportfolios this evaluation includes assessments related to particular industries and specific macroeconomic trends 40   table 11 loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing  

 

 allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects the credit losses inherent in the company’s loan portfolio as of the financial statement date based on a consistent methodology for assessing credit risk the company’s allowance methodology assumes that the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of chargeoffs and nonperforming loans will change at different points in time based on credit performance loan mix and collateral values an analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses including chargeoffs and recoveries by loan category is presented in note 6 loans and allowance for loan losses to financial statements at december 31 2002 the allowance for loan losses was 382 billion or 198 of total loans compared with 372 billion or 222 at december 31 2001 and 368 billion or 237 at december 31 2000 the primary driver of the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in 2002 and in 2001 was the changing loan mix with residential real estate secured consumer loans representing a higher percentage of the overall loan portfolio the company has historically experienced lower losses on its residential real estate secured consumer loan portfolio the provision for loan losses totaled 168 billion in 2002 173 billion in 2001 and 128 billion in 2000 net chargeoffs in 2002 were 168 billion or 96 of average total loans compared with 173 billion or 110 in 2001 and 118 billion or 84 in 2000 loan loss recoveries were 481 million in 2002 compared with 396 million in 2001 and 415 million in 2000 any loan that is past due as to principal or interest and that is not both wellsecured and in the process of collection is generally charged off to the extent that it exceeds the fair value of any related collateral after a predetermined period of time that is based on loan category additionally loans are charged off when classified as a loss by either internal loan examiners or regulatory examiners the company considers the allowance for loan losses of 382 billion adequate to cover losses inherent in loans commitments to extend credit and standby and other letters of credit at december 31 2002 the process for determining the adequacy for loan losses is critical to the financial results of the company and requires subjective and complex judgment by management 41   as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain see “financial review – critical accounting policies – allowance for loan losses” therefore no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizeable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio in light of the factors then prevailing including economic conditions and the ongoing examination process by the company and its regulators will not require significant increases in the allowance for loan losses for discussion of the process by which the company determines the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses see note 6 loans and allowance for loan losses to financial statements assetliability and market risk management assetliability management comprises the evaluation monitoring and management of the company’s interest rate risk market risk and liquidity and funding the corporate assetliability management committee corporate alco maintains oversight of these risks corporate alco is comprised of senior financial and senior business executives each of the company’s principal business groups – community banking including mortgage banking and wholesale banking – have individual assetliability management committees and processes linked to the corporate alco process interest rate risk interest rate risk one of the more prominent risks in terms of potential earnings impact is an inevitable part of being a financial intermediary it can occur for any one or more of the following reasons a assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times for example if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally falling company earnings will initially decline b assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts for example when the general level of interest rates is falling the company may choose for customer management competitive or other reasons to reduce the rates paid on checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general decline in market interest rates c shortterm and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts ie the shape of the yield curve may impact new loan yields and funding costs differently or d the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example mortgagebacked securities held in the securities available for sale portfolio may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated – with an associated reduction in portfolio income – if longterm mortgage interest rates decline sharply in addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on net interest income through these channels interest rates indirectly impact earnings through their effect on loan demand credit losses mortgage origination fees the value of mortgage servicing rights the value of the pension liability and other sources of company earnings the company simulates its future net income under multiple interest rate paths that differ in the direction of interest rate changes the degree of change over time the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve as of december 31 2002 the simulation analysis indicated that the company’s earnings would tend to decrease from most likely expectations under scenarios of much higher shortterm rates accompanied by higher but less pronounced increases 42   in longterm rates as an example a 200 increase in the federal funds rate accompanied by a 150 increase in the 10 year constant maturity treasury rate from levels prevailing at year end would reduce estimated net income by approximately 2 relative to the company’s most likely earnings plan over a twelve month horizon the principal source of net income risk in that particular scenario is a modeled slowdown in mortgage origination activity and narrower new business spreads associated with a flatter yield curve simulation estimates are highly dependent on and will change with the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time each simulation is done the company uses exchangetraded and overthecounter interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate exposures the credit risk amount and estimated net fair values of these derivatives as of december 31 2002 and 2001 are indicated in note 27 derivative financial instruments to financial statements derivatives are used for assetliability management in three ways a most of the company’s longterm fixedrate debt is converted to floatingrate payments by entering into receivefixed swaps at issuance b the cash flows from selected asset andor liability instrumentsportfolios are converted from fixed to floating payments or vice versa and c the company’s mortgage operation actively uses swaptions futures forwards and rate options to hedge the mortgage pipeline funded mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights asset mortgage banking interest rate risk the company originates funds and services mortgage loans these activities subject the company to a number of risks including credit liquidity and interest rate risks the company manages credit and liquidity risk by selling or securitizing the loans it originates changes in interest rates however may have a potentially large impact on mortgage banking income in any calendar quarter and over time the company manages both the risk to net income over time from all sources as well as the risk to an immediate reduction in the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights the company relies on mortgage loans held on its balance sheet and derivative instruments to maintain these risks within corporate alco parameters at december 31 2002 the company had capitalized mortgage servicing rights of 45 billion the value of its servicing rights portfolio is influenced by prepayment speed assumptions affecting the duration of the mortgage loans to which the servicing rights relate changes in longterm interest rates affect these prepayment speed assumptions for example a decrease in longterm rates would accelerate prepayment speed assumptions as borrowers refinance their mortgage loans under gaap impairment to the company’s servicing rights due to a decrease in longterm rates or other reasons would be reflected as a charge to earnings the company manages this risk in two ways first a major portion of the mortgage servicing rights asset is hedged with derivative contracts the principal source of risk in this hedging process is the risk that changes in the value of the hedging contracts may not match changes in the value of the hedged portion of the mortgage servicing rights for any given change in longterm interest rates second a portion of the potential reduction in the value of the mortgage servicing rights asset for a given decline in interest rates is offset by estimated increases in origination and servicing fees over a twelve month period from new mortgage activity or refinancing associated with that decline in interest rates in a scenario of much lower longterm interest rates the decline in the value of the mortgage servicing rights and its impact on net income would be immediate whereas 43   the additional origination and servicing fee income accrues over time net of impairment reserves the capitalized mortgage servicing rights asset is valued at 92 of the total servicing portfolio at december 31 2002 down from 154 of the servicing portfolio at december 31 2001 market risk  trading activities the company incurs interest rate risk foreign exchange risk equity price risk and commodity price risk in several trading businesses managed under limits set by corporate alco the primary purpose of these businesses is to accommodate customers in the management of their market price risks additionally the company takes positions based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and markets all securities loans foreign exchange transactions commodity transactions and derivatives transacted with customers or used to hedge capital market transactions done with customers are carried at fair value counterparty risk limits are established and monitored by the institutional risk committee the notional or contractual amount credit risk amount and estimated net fair value of all customer accommodation derivatives as of december 31 2002 and 2001 are indicated in note 27 derivative financial instruments to financial statements open “at

interval within a given confidence range 99 for all trading positions covered by value at risk measures did not exceed 25 million market risk  equity markets equity markets impact the company in both direct and indirect ways the company makes and manages direct equity investments in start up businesses emerging growth companies management buyouts acquisitions and corporate recapitalizations the company also invests in nonaffiliated funds that make similar private equity investments these private equity investments are made within capital allocations approved by the company’s management and its board of directors business developments key risks and historical returns for the private equity investments are reviewed with the board at least annually management reviews these investments at least quarterly and assesses for possible otherthantemporary impairment for nonmarketable investments the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of each individual investment and the expectations for that investment’s cash flows and capital needs the viability of its business model and the company’s exit strategy at december 31 2002 the private equity investments totaled 1657 million compared with 1696 million at december 31 2001 the company also has marketable equity securities in its available for sale investment portfolio including shares distributed from the company’s venture capital activities these investments are managed within capital risk limits approved by management and the board and monitored by corporate alco gains and losses on these securities are recognized in net income when realized and in addition otherthantemporary impairment may be periodically recorded the initial indicator of impairment for marketable equity securities is a sustained decline in market price below the amount recorded for that investment the company considers such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost the financial 44   condition capital strength and nearterm prospects of the issuer any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and to a lesser degree the company’s investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the stock price if any at december 31 2002 the fair value of the marketable equity securities was 556 million and cost was 598 million compared with 991 million and 815 million respectively at december 31 2001 changes in equity market prices may also indirectly impact the company’s net income by impacting the value of third party assets under management and hence fee income by impacting particular borrowers whose ability to repay principal andor interest may be impacted by the stock market or by impacting other business activities these indirect risks are monitored and managed as part of the operations of each business line liquidity and funding the objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the company can meet customer loan requests customer deposit maturitieswithdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unforeseen and unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress to achieve this objective corporate alco establishes and monitors liquidity guidelines requiring sufficient asset based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid overdependence on volatile less reliable funding markets the company sets liquidity management guidelines for both the consolidated balance sheet as well as for the parent

company sold residential mortgage loans of approximately 270 billion including securitized residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans of approximately 220 billion the amount of such assets as well as home equity loans and other consumer loans available to be sold or securitized totaled approximately 115 billion at december 31 2002 core customer deposits have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds the company’s average core deposits and stockholders’ equity funded 663 and 683 of its average total assets in 2002 and 2001

earning assets the company’s net interest margin was 529 for 2001 compared with 523 in 2000 noninterest income was 901 billion in 2001 compared with 1036 billion in 2000 the decrease was due to approximately 172 billion before tax of impairment writedowns in the second quarter of 2001 reflecting otherthantemporary impairment in the valuation of publiclytraded securities and private equity investments partially offset by increases in gains on sales of debt securities available for sale mortgage banking income and gains on dispositions of operations the increase in mortgage banking income was the result of an increase in mortgage origination and other closing fees that was predominantly due to increased refinancing activity resulting from the decline in fixedrate mortgage rates during the last three quarters of 2001 mortgage servicing fees before amortization and valuation provision for impairment increased in 2001 in line with substantial growth in the servicing portfolio however these additional fees were more than offset by increased amortization and valuation provision for impairment for mortgage servicing rights such valuation adjustments are driven by higher estimated prepayments assumed to be associated with the lower prevailing level of interest rates during 2001 the mortgage industry experienced high levels of prepayment activity as a result of lower interest rates the fnma current coupon rate ie the secondary market par mortgage yield for 30 year fixedrate mortgages was 645 at december 31 2001 compared with 696 at december 31 2000 consequently assumed prepayment speeds an important element in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights increased dramatically resulting in valuation provision for impairment of 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 given the level of interest rates at december 31 2000 and the resulting assumptions used to value mortgage servicing rights and other retained interests the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights were in excess of the company’s carrying value at december 31 2000 therefore no valuation allowance was recognized revenue the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was 2070 billion in 2000 and 2098 billion in 2001 revenue in 2001 included approximately 172 billion before tax of noncash impairment noninterest expense totaled 1379 billion in 2001 compared with 1289 billion in 2000 an increase of 7 the increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and incentive compensation from increases in fulltime equivalent team members and higher commissions due to record mortgage originations expense growth also included the effect of acquisitions particularly acordia the fifth largest insurance broker in the us 48   the provision for loan losses was 173 billion in 2001 compared with 128 billion in 2000 during 2001 net chargeoffs were 173 billion or 110 of average total loans compared with 118 billion or 84 during 2000 the allowance for loan losses was 372 billion or 222 of total loans at december 31 2001 compared with 368 billion or 237 at december 31 2000 at december 31 2001 total nonaccrual loans were 164 billion or 10 of total loans compared with 119 billion or 7 at december 31 2000 foreclosed assets were 160 million at december 31 2001 compared with 120 million at december 31 2000 the ratio of common stockholders’ equity to total assets was 882 at december 31 2001 compared with 962 at december 31 2000 the company’s total riskbased capital rbc ratio at december 31 2001 was 1101 and its tier 1 rbc ratio was 699 exceeding the minimum regulatory guidelines of 8 and 4 respectively for bank holding companies the company’s rbc ratios at december 31 2000 were 1044 and 730 respectively the company’s tier 1 leverage ratios were 624 and 648 at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively exceeding the minimum regulatory guideline of 3 for bank holding companies factors that may affect future results we make forwardlooking statements in this report and in other reports and proxy statements we file with the sec in addition our senior management might make forwardlooking statements orally to analysts investors the media and others broadly speaking forwardlooking statements include     in this report for example we make forwardlooking statements discussing our expectations about       forwardlooking statements discuss matters that are not historical facts because they discuss future events or conditions forwardlooking statements often include words such as “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “plan” “project” “target” “can” “could” “may” “should” “will” “would” or similar expressions do not unduly rely on forwardlooking 49   statements they give our expectations about the future and are not guarantees forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we might not update them to reflect changes that occur after the date they are made there are several factors—many beyond our control—that could cause results to differ significantly from our expectations some of these factors are described below other factors such as credit market operational liquidity interest rate and other risks and factors relating to the regulation and supervision of the company are described elsewhere in this report see for example “balance sheet analysis” and “regulation and supervision” any factor described in this report could by itself or together with one or more other factors adversely affect our business results of operations andor financial condition there are factors not described in this form 10ka that could cause results to differ from our expectations industry factors as a financial services company our earnings are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions our business and earnings are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad these conditions include shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation monetary supply fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate for example an economic downturn increase in unemployment or other events that negatively impact household andor corporate incomes could decrease the demand for the company’s loan and nonloan products and services and increase the number of customers who fail to pay interest or principal on their loans geopolitical conditions can also impact our earnings acts or threats of terrorism actions taken by the us or other governments in response to acts or threats of terrorism andor military conflicts including a war with iraq could impact business and economic conditions in the us and abroad the terrorist attacks in 2001 for example caused an immediate decrease in demand for air travel which adversely affected not only the airline industry but also other travelrelated and leisure industries such as lodging gaming and tourism we discuss other business and economic conditions in more detail elsewhere in this report our earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments both of which impact our net interest margin and can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights its policies also can affect our borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans changes in federal reserve board policies are beyond our control and hard to predict or anticipate 50   the financial services industry is highly competitive we operate in a highly competitive industry which could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation banks securities firms and insurance companies can now merge by creating a new type of financial services company called a “financial holding company” which can offer virtually any type of financial service including banking securities underwriting insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking recently a number of foreign banks have acquired financial services companies in the united states further increasing competition in the us market also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures we are heavily regulated by federal and state agencies the holding company its subsidiary banks and many of its nonbank subsidiaries are heavily regulated at the federal and state levels this regulation is to protect depositors federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole not security holders congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer andor increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products also our failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and damage to our reputation for more information refer to “regulation and supervision” and to notes 4 cash loan and dividend restrictions and 25 regulatory and agency capital requirements to financial statements future legislation could change our competitive position various legislation including proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system and to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies is from time to time introduced in the congress this legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company or any of its subsidiaries 51   we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements and other financial information we also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and with respect to financial statements on reports of independent auditors for example in deciding whether to extend credit we may assume that a customer’s audited financial statements conform with gaap and present fairly in all material respects the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the customer we also may rely on the audit report covering those financial statements our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with gaap or that are materially misleading consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits company factors maintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards there is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices this can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our feebased products and services in addition the widespread adoption of new technologies including internetbased services could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services we might not successfully introduce new products and services achieve market acceptance of our products and services andor develop and maintain loyal customers the holding company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue the holding company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the holding company’s common and preferred stock and interest and principal on its debt various federal andor state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to the holding company also the holding company’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors for more information refer to “regulation and supervision—dividend restrictions” and “—holding company structure” 52   our accounting policies and methods are key to how we report our financial condition and results of operations and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that not only do they comply with generally accepted accounting principles but also that they reflect management’s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements describes our significant accounting policies we have identified three accounting policies as being “critical” to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions these critical accounting policies relate to 1 the determination of allowance for loan losses 2 the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and 3 pension accounting because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates about these matters we cannot provide any assurance that the company will not    for more information refer in this report to “critical accounting policies” “balance sheet analysis” and “risk management” we have businesses other than banking we are a diversified financial services company in addition to banking we provide insurance investments mortgages and consumer finance although we believe our diversity helps mitigate the impact to the company when downturns affect any one segment of our industry it also means that our earnings could be subject to different risks and uncertainties we discuss some examples below merchant banking  our merchant banking activities include venture capital investments which have a much greater risk of capital losses than our traditional banking activities also it is difficult to predict the timing of any gains from these activities realization of gains from our venture capital investments depends on a number of factors—many beyond our control—including general economic conditions the prospects of the companies in which we invest when these companies go public the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we 53   are subject to any resale restrictions factors such as a slowdown in consumer demand or a deterioration in capital spending on technology and telecommunications equipment could result in declines in the values of our publiclytraded and private equity securities if we determine that the declines are otherthantemporary additional impairment charges would be recognized also we will realize losses to the extent we sell securities at less than book value for more information see in this report “balance sheet analysis—securities available for sale” mortgage banking  the impact of interest rates on our mortgage banking business can be large and complex changes in interest rates can impact loan origination fees and loan servicing fees which account for a significant portion of mortgagerelated revenues a decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for mortgage loans as borrowers refinance but also generally leads to accelerated payoffs in our mortgage servicing portfolio conversely in a constant or increasing rate environment we would expect fewer loans to be refinanced and a decline in payoffs in our servicing portfolio although the company uses dynamic and sophisticated models to assess the impact of interest rates on mortgage fees amortization of mortgage servicing rights and the value of mortgage servicing assets the estimates of net income and fair value produced by these models are dependent on estimates and assumptions of future loan demand prepayment speeds and other factors which may overstate or understate actual subsequent experience in addition although the company uses derivative instruments to hedge the value of its servicing portfolio the hedges do not cover the full value of the portfolio and the company can provide no assurances that the hedges will be effective to offset significant decreases in the value of the portfolio for more information see in this report “critical accounting policies—mortgage servicing rights valuation” and “asset liability and market risk management” we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure third parties provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections and network access any disruption in internet network access or other voice or data communication services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party we have an active acquisition program we regularly explore opportunities to acquire financial institutions and other financial services providers we cannot predict the number size or timing of future acquisitions we typically do not comment publicly on a possible acquisition or business combination until we have signed a definitive agreement for the transaction our ability to successfully complete an acquisition generally is subject to regulatory approval and we cannot be certain when or if or on what terms and conditions any required regulatory approvals will be granted we might be required to divest banks or branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval 54   difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from the acquisition specifically the integration process could result in higher than expected deposit attrition runoff loss of key employees the disruption of our business or the business of the acquired company or otherwise adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition also the negative impact of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in connection with acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected legislative risk our business model is dependent on sharing information between the family of companies owned by wells fargo to better satisfy our customers’ needs laws that restrict the ability of our companies to share information about customers could negatively impact our revenue and profit our business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the company can be intense we may not be able to hire people or to keep them our stock price can be volatile our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including          general market fluctuations industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as the recent terrorist attacks economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes credit loss trends or currency fluctuations also could cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results 55   additional information common stock of the company is traded on the new york stock exchange and the chicago stock

financial services company providing banking insurance investments mortgage banking and consumer finance through banking stores the internet and other distribution channels to consumers commercial businesses and financial institutions in all 50 states of the us and in other countries wells fargo  company the parent is a financial holding company and a bank holding company the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and prevailing practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates have been made by management in several areas including the allowance for loan losses note 6 the valuation of mortgage servicing rights notes 22 and 23 and pension accounting note 16 actual results could differ from those estimates certain amounts in the financial statements for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current financial statement presentation as discussed in note 2 auto lease accounting and reclassification the following is a description of the significant accounting policies of the company consolidation the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the parent and its majorityowned subsidiaries which are consolidated on a linebyline basis significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation other affiliates in which there is at least 20 ownership are generally accounted for by the equity method those in which there is less than 20 ownership are generally carried at cost except for marketable equity securities which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in other comprehensive income assets that are accounted for by either the equity or cost method are included in other assets securities securities are accounted for according to their purpose and holding period securities available for sale   debt securities that might not be held until maturity and marketable equity securities are classified as securities available for sale and are reported at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses after applicable taxes reported as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income the estimated fair value of a security is determined based on current quotations where available where current quotations are not available the estimated fair value is determined based primarily on the present value of future cash flows adjusted for the quality rating of the securities prepayment assumptions and other factors the 61   asset value is reduced when declines in the value of debt securities and marketable equity securities are considered other than temporary and the estimated loss is recorded in noninterest income the initial indicator of impairment for marketable equity securities is a sustained decline in market price below the amount recorded for that investment the company considers such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost the financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects of the issuer any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and to a lesser degree the company’s investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the stock price if any these investments are managed within capital risk limits approved by management and the board and monitored by the corporate assetliability management committee realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in noninterest income using the specific identification method for certain debt securities for example government national mortgage association securities the company anticipates prepayments of principal in the calculation of the effective yield used to accrete discounts or amortize premiums to interest income trading securities   securities acquired for shortterm appreciation or other trading purposes are recorded in a trading portfolio and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest income trading securities are included in other assets in the balance sheet nonmarketable equity securities   nonmarketable equity securities include venture capital equity securities that are not publiclytraded and securities acquired for various purposes such as to meet regulatory requirements for example federal reserve bank stock these assets are reviewed at least quarterly for possible otherthantemporary impairment management’s review typically includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment the expectations for that investment’s cash flows and capital needs the viability of its business model and the company’s exit strategy these securities are generally accounted for at cost and are included in other assets the asset value is reduced when declines in value are considered to be other than temporary and the estimated loss is recognized as a loss from equity investments and included in noninterest income mortgages held for sale mortgages held for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value the determination of any writedown to market value includes consideration of all open positions outstanding commitments from investors and interest rate lock commitment value already recorded loans held for sale loans held for sale include those student loans that the company has demonstrated the intent and ability to sell such loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value gains and losses on loan sales are recorded in noninterest income based on the difference between sales proceeds and carrying value 62   loans loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding net of unearned income unearned income which includes deferred fees net of deferred direct incremental loan origination costs is amortized to interest income generally over the contractual life of the loan using an interest method nonaccrual loans   loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal unless both wellsecured and in the process of collection when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when a portion of the principal balance has been charged off real estate 14 family loans both first liens and junior liens are placed on nonaccrual status within 120 days of becoming past due as to interest or principal regardless of security generally consumer loans not secured by real estate are placed on nonaccrual status only when a portion of the principal has been charged off such loans are entirely charged off when deemed uncollectible or when they reach a predetermined number of days past due depending upon loan product industry practice country terms and other factors when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method thereafter until qualifying for return to accrual status generally a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement or when the loan is both wellsecured and in the process of collection and collectibility is no longer doubtful impaired loans   loans other than smallerbalance homogeneous loans and wholesale loans with a balance less than 1 million are considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement including scheduled interest payments this assessment for impairment occurs when such loans are on nonaccrual when a loan over 1 million with unique risk characteristics has been identified as being impaired the amount of impairment will be measured by the company using discounted cash flows except when it is determined that the sole remaining source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral in such cases the current fair value of the collateral reduced by costs to sell will be used in place of discounted cash flows if the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan including accrued interest net deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount an impairment is recognized by creating or adjusting an existing allocation of the allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses   the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date the company’s determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses rests upon various judgments and assumptions including general economic conditions loan portfolio composition prior loan loss experience evaluation of credit risk related to certain individual borrowers and pools of homogenous loans 63   periodic use of sensitivity analysis and expected loss simulation modeling and the company’s ongoing internal audit and examination processes and those of its regulators transfers and servicing of financial assets a transfer of financial assets is accounted for as a sale when control is surrendered over the assets transferred servicing rights and other retained interests in the assets sold are recorded by allocating the previous recorded investment between the assets sold and the interest retained based on their relative fair values if practicable to determine at the date of transfer fair values of servicing rights and other retained interests at the date of transfer are determined using present value of estimated future cash flows valuation techniques incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of values the company recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others whether the servicing rights are acquired through purchases or retained upon sales of loan originations mortgage servicing rights are amortized over the period of estimated net servicing income for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of mortgage servicing rights the company stratifies its portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics including loan type and note rate based upon current fair values mortgage servicing rights are assessed quarterly for impairment any such indicated provision for impairment is recognized in income during the period in which it occurs in a mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance account which is adjusted each subsequent period to reflect any increase or decrease in the indicated impairment the company reviews mortgage servicing rights for otherthantemporary impairment each quarter and recognizes a direct writedown when the recoverability of a recorded valuation allowance is determined to be remote in determining whether otherthantemporary impairment has taken place the company considers both historical and projected trends in interest rates and pay off activity and the potential for impairment recovery through interest rate increases unlike a valuation allowance a direct writedown permanently reduces the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights precluding subsequent reversals the current fair values of mortgage servicing rights and other retained interests are determined using present value of estimated future cash flows valuation techniques incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of values premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization capital leases are included in premises and equipment at the capitalized amount less accumulated amortization depreciation and amortization are computed primarily using the straightline method estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for buildings up to 10 years for furniture and equipment and the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term for leasehold improvements capitalized leased assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the lives of the respective leases which generally range from 20 to 35 years 64   goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting on july 1 2001 the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 142 fas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas 142 eliminates amortization of goodwill associated with business combinations completed after june 30 2001 during the transition period from july 1 2001 through december 31 2001 the company’s goodwill associated with business combinations completed prior to july 1 2001 continued to be amortized over periods of up to 25 years effective january 1 2002 all goodwill amortization was discontinued effective january 1 2002 the company assesses goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently in the presence of certain circumstances on a reporting unit level by applying a fairvaluebased test using discounted estimated future net cash flows impairment exists when the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value in the first quarter of 2002 the company completed its initial goodwill impairment assessment and recorded a transitional impairment charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income impairment losses are recognized in accordance with fas 142 as a charge to noninterest expense unless related to discontinued operations and an adjustment to the carrying value of the goodwill asset subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited core deposit intangibles are amortized on an accelerated basis based on useful lives of up to 15 years other identifiable intangible assets that are included in other assets are generally amortized using an accelerated method over useful lives of up to 15 years the company reviews core deposit intangibles and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable except mortgage servicing rights which are reviewed quarterly for these intangible assets impairment is indicated if the sum of undiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset impairment is recognized by writing down the asset to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value subsequent reversals of intangible assets impairment losses are prohibited operating lease assets operating lease rental income for leased assets generally autos is recognized on a straightline basis related depreciation expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the life of the lease taking into account the estimated residual value of the leased asset on a periodic basis leased assets are reviewed for impairment impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of leased assets exceeds fair value and is not considered recoverable the carrying amount of leased assets is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the then estimated residual value upon the eventual disposition of the equipment auto lease receivables are written off when 120 days past due 65   pension accounting the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using an actuarial model required by fasb statement no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  this model uses an approach that allocates pension costs over the service period of employees in the plan the principle underlying this accounting is that employees render service ratably over this period and therefore the income statement effects of pensions should follow the same pattern one of the principal components of the net periodic pension calculation is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the required use of an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income returns that are greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm returns are designed to approximate the actual longterm returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the service period related to employees in the plan any difference between actual and expected return in excess of a 5 corridor is recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over five subsequent years the company uses longterm historical actual return information the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of longterm investment returns to develop its expected return on plan assets the discount rate assumptions used for pension accounting reflect the rates available at the measurement date on highquality fixedincome debt instruments income taxes the company files a consolidated federal income tax return combined state tax returns are filed in certain states deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability or balance sheet method under this method the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws foreign taxes paid are applied as credits to reduce federal income taxes payable stockbased compensation the company has several stockbased employee compensation plans which are described more fully in note 15 as permitted by fasb statement no 123 fas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  the company has elected to continue applying the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its stock plans as required by fasb statement no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure an amendment to fasb statement 123  pro forma net income and earnings per common share information is provided below as if the company accounted for its employee stock option plans under the fair value method of fas 123 the fair value of options was estimated at the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing 66   model which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable because the company’s stock options have characteristics significantly more restrictive than those of traded or transferable options in management’s opinion the existing valuation models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of stock options  

earnings per common share earnings per common share are presented under two formats earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income after deducting dividends on preferred stock by the average number of common shares outstanding during the year diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income after deducting dividends on preferred stock by the average number of common shares outstanding during the year plus the impact of common stock equivalents ie stock options restricted share rights and convertible subordinated debentures that are dilutive derivative instruments and hedging activities on january 1 2001 the company adopted fasb statement no 133 fas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and fasb statement no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activitiesan amendment of fasb statement no 133  all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value on the date the company enters into a derivative contract the company designates the derivative instrument as 1 a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment “fair value” hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability “cash flow” hedge or 3 held for trading customer accommodation or not qualifying for hedge 67   accounting “freestanding derivative instruments” for a fair value hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period net income in the same financial statement category as the hedged item for a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument to the extent that it is effective are recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified to net income in the same periods that the hedged transaction impacts net income in the same financial statement category as the hedged item for freestanding derivative instruments changes in the fair values are reported in current period noninterest income the company formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes linking all derivative instruments that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions the company also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative instruments used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge hedge accounting is discontinued the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1 it determines that a derivative instrument is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item 2 a derivative instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised 3 a derivative instrument is dedesignated as a hedge instrument because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur or 4 management determines that designation of a derivative instrument as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that a derivative instrument no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge the derivative instrument will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings and the previously hedged asset or liability will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value previous adjustments to the hedged item will be accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of the asset or liability when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur the derivative instrument will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings when hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedging instrument is sold terminated or dedesignated the amount reported in other comprehensive income to the date of sale termination or dedesignation will continue to be reported in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction impacts earnings in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued the derivative instrument will be carried at its fair value on the balance sheet with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings the company occasionally purchases or originates financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative instrument at inception of the financial instrument the company assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative instrument are clearly and 68   closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument host contract whether the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument if the embedded derivative instrument is determined not to be clearly and closely related to the host contract is not currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings and the embedded derivative instrument would qualify as a derivative instrument the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes recorded in current period earnings as permitted by the fasb the company has elected not to apply fas 133 to embedded derivative instruments that existed on january 1 2001 and were issued or acquired before january 1 1999 and not substantially modified thereafter prior to the adoption of fas 133 the company primarily used interest rate derivative contracts to hedge mismatches in the rate maturity of loans and their funding sources and the price risk of interestrate sensitive assets interest rate derivative contracts were accounted for by the deferral or accrual method if designated as hedges and expected to be effective in reducing risk the resulting gains or losses were deferred and recognized in income along with effects of related hedged asset or liability if the hedge was no longer deemed to be effective hedge accounting was discontinued previously unrecognized hedge results and the net settlement upon closeout were deferred and amortized over the life of the hedged asset or liability if the hedged asset or liability settled before maturity of the interest rate derivative contract and the derivative contract was closed out or settled the net settlement amount was accounted for as part of the gains and losses on the hedged item the company also entered into various derivative contracts to provide derivative products as customer accommodations derivative contracts used for this purpose were marked to market and recorded as a component of noninterest income 69   2 auto lease accounting and reclassifications in may 2003 the emerging issues task force eitf published topic d107 lessor consideration of thirdparty residual value guarantees which clarifies accounting guidance for certain lease transactions with residual value guarantees based on this new guidance the company has determined that certain auto leases previously accounted for as direct financing leases should be recorded as operating leases this guidance resulted in a reclassification of auto leases from loans to operating lease assets included in other assets on the balance sheet in addition the revised income statement presentation reflects a reduction of interest income related to direct financing leases and the recognition of rental income and depreciation expense on operating leases previously reported consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements have been presented in conformity with the guidance in topic d107 the following tables present certain captions of the statement of income and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2002 and certain captions in the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2002 and 2001 revised to conform with the guidance in topic d107  

70    

 

this guidance also resulted in revisions to notes 6 7 21 22 24 and 28 in addition to the matter discussed above the company has reclassified other amounts to conform with current financial statement presentation including 1 certain mortgages loan chargeoffs and recoveries from junior lien mortgages to first mortgages in notes 6 and 22 2 temporary personnel expenses from outside professional services and other expenses to contract services in note 16 3 investment advisory fees from other noninterest income to trust and investment fees on the statement of income and 4 in the statement of cash flows provided separate presentation of mortgage servicing rights impairment 71   3 business combinations the company regularly explores opportunities to acquire financial institutions and related financial services businesses generally management of the company does not make a public announcement about an acquisition opportunity until a definitive agreement has been signed excluding the company’s merger with first security corporation the table below includes transactions completed in the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000  

72   at december 31 2002 the company had three pending business combinations with total assets of approximately 700 million and anticipates that the transactions will be completed during the first quarter of 2003 in connection with certain brokerage asset management and insurance agency acquisitions made by the company the terms of the acquisition agreement provide for deferred payments or additional consideration based on certain performance targets at december 31 2002 the amount of contingent consideration expected to be paid was not material to the company’s financial statements merger involving the company and first security corporation on october 25 2000 the merger involving the company and first security corporation was completed as a poolingofinterests under the terms of the merger agreement stockholders of first security received 355 shares of common stock of the company for each share of common stock owned as a condition to the merger the company was required by regulatory agencies to divest 39 stores in idaho new mexico nevada and utah having aggregate deposits of approximately 15 billion these sales were completed in the first quarter of 2001 and the company realized a net gain of 96 million which included a 54 million reduction of goodwill 4 cash loan and dividend restrictions federal reserve board frb regulations require reserve balances on deposits to be maintained with the federal reserve banks by each of the banking subsidiaries the average required reserve balance was 18 billion and 21 billion in 2002 and 2001 respectively federal law places restrictions on the amount and the terms of both credit and noncredit transactions between a bank and its nonbank affiliates these transactions between a bank and its nonbank affiliates are limited they may not exceed 10 of the bank’s capital and surplus which for this purpose represents tier 1 and tier 2 capital as calculated under the riskbased capital guidelines plus the balance of the allowance for loan losses excluded from tier 2 capital with any single nonbank affiliate and 20 of the bank’s capital and surplus with all its nonbank affiliates transactions that are extensions of credit may require collateral to be held to provide added security to the bank for further discussion of riskbased capital see note 26 the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks is subject to various federal and state regulatory limitations dividends payable by a national bank without the express approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency occ are limited to that bank’s retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year retained net profits are defined by the occ as net income less dividends declared during the period as determined based on regulatory accounting principles the company also has statechartered subsidiary banks that are subject to state regulations that limit dividends under those provisions the company’s national and statechartered subsidiary banks could have declared dividends of 1585 million and 1026 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively without obtaining prior regulatory approval in addition the company’s nonbank subsidiaries could have declared dividends of 1252 million and 1292 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively 73   5 securities available for sale the following table provides the cost and fair value for the major components of securities available for sale carried at fair value there were no securities classified as held to maturity at the end of 2002 or 2001  

 

 securities pledged where the secured party has the right to sell or repledge totaled 36 billion at december 31 2002 and 76 billion at december 31 2001 securities pledged where the secured party does not have the right to sell or repledge totaled 179 billion at december 31 2002 and 157 billion at december 31 2001 and are primarily pledged to secure trust and public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law the company has accepted collateral in the form of securities that it has the right to sell or repledge of 31 billion at december 31 2002 and 27 billion at december 31 2001 of which 17 billion and 14 billion had been sold or repledged at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively securities available for sale decreased from 403 billion at december 31 2001 to 279 billion at december 31 2002 the decrease was predominantly due to a decrease in federal agency securities from the sale of certain longermaturity mortgagebacked securities subject to prepayment risk and prepayments of mortgagebacked securities held 74   the table below provides the components of the realized net gains losses on the sales of securities from the securities available for sale portfolio including those related to mortgage banking and marketable equity securities  

 

 the decrease in realized gross losses between december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 was due to a 118 billion otherthantemporary impairment the company recognized in the second quarter of 2001 the table below provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and yields taxableequivalent basis of debt securities available for sale the remaining contractual principal maturities for mortgagebacked securities were allocated assuming no prepayments remaining maturities will differ from contractual maturities because mortgage debt issuers may have the right to prepay obligations prior to contractual maturity  

 

 75   6 loans and allowance for loan losses a summary of the major categories of loans outstanding and related unfunded commitments is shown in the table below unfunded commitments are defined as all legally binding agreements to extend credit net of all funds lent and all standby and commercial letters of credit issued under the terms of those commitments at december 31 2002 and 2001 the commercial loan category did not have a concentration in any industry that exceeded 10 of total loans at december 31 2002 and 2001 neither the real estate 14 family first nor junior lien mortgage categories had a concentration in any state that exceeded 10 of total loans except for the 14 family first mortgage category in california which represents 13 of total loans at december 31 2002 and 2001 the other revolving credit and monthly payment category did not have any concentration in any product type that exceeded 10 of total loans  

 

 in the course of evaluating the credit risk presented by a customer and the pricing that will adequately compensate the company for assuming that risk management may require a certain amount of collateral support the type of collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable inventory land buildings equipment incomeproducing commercial properties and residential real estate the company has the same collateral requirements for loans whether they are funded immediately or on a delayed basis commitment a commitment to extend credit is a legally binding agreement to lend funds to a customer usually at a stated interest rate and for a specified purpose such commitments have fixed expiration dates and generally require a fee the extension of a commitment gives rise to credit risk the actual liquidity requirements or credit risk that the company will experience will be lower than 76   the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit shown in the table on the previous page because a significant portion of those commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon certain commitments are subject to loan agreements containing covenants regarding the financial performance of the customer that must be met before the company is required to fund the commitment the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as it does in making loans in addition the company manages the potential credit risk in commitments to extend credit by limiting the total amount of arrangements both by individual customer and in the aggregate by monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and by applying the same credit standards maintained for all of its related credit activities the credit risk associated with these commitments is considered in management’s determination of the allowance for loan losses standby letters of credit totaled 63 billion and 55 billion at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively standby letters of credit are issued on behalf of customers in connection with contracts between the customers and third parties under standby letters of credit the company assures that the third parties will receive specified funds if customers fail to meet their contractual obligations the liquidity risk to the company arises from its obligation to make payment in the event of a customer’s contractual default the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit and the company’s management of that credit risk is considered in management’s determination of the allowance for loan losses standby letters of credit are reported net of participations sold to other institutions of 1129 million and 736 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively deferred fees associated with these standby letters of credit were immaterial to the company’s financial statements included in standby letters of credit are those that back financial instruments financial guarantees the company had issued or purchased participations in financial guarantees of approximately 30 billion and 16 billion at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the company also had commitments for commercial and similar letters of credit of 719 million and 577 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively substantially all fees received from the issuance of financial guarantees are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over the term of the guarantee the company has entered into various contingent performance guarantee arrangements with terms ranging from 1 to 30 years these guarantees have arisen through certain risk participation agreements lending arrangements or sales of loans the impact of these guarantees at december 31 2002 was not material to the company’s financial statements the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses which assesses the risk and losses inherent in its portfolio this process provides an allowance consisting of two components allocated and unallocated to arrive at the allocated component of the allowance the company combines estimates of the allowances needed for loans analyzed individually including impaired loans subject to fasb statement no 114 fas 114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and loans analyzed on a pooled basis 77   the determination of the allocated allowance for portfolios of larger commercial and commercial real estate loans involves the use of a continuous and standardized loan grading process in combination with a review of individual higherrisk transactions the company grades loans and assigns a loss factor to each pool of loans based on the grades the loss factors used for this analysis are derived in two ways first migration models are used to determine loss factors by tracking actual portfolio movements between loan grades over the loss emergence period of these portfolios second in the case of graded loans without identified credit weakness the loss factors are estimated using a combination of longterm average loss experience of the company’s graded portfolios and external industry data in addition the company analyzes larger nonperforming loans individually for impairment using a cash flow or collateral based methodology calculated impairment is included in the allowance unless impairment is recognized through a chargeoff in the case of more homogeneous portfolios such as consumer loans and leases residential mortgage loans and some segments of small business loans the determination of the allocated allowance is conducted at an aggregate or pooled level for such portfolios the risk assessment process includes the use of forecasting models which focus on recent delinquency and loss trends in different portfolio segments to measure inherent loss in these portfolios such analyses are updated frequently to capture recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios as well as any changes in management’s loss mitigation or customer solicitation strategies in order to reduce the differences between estimated and observed losses the risk associated with unfunded commitments and letters of credit are a consideration in the loss factor analysis associated with loans outstanding this risk assessment is converted to a loan equivalent factor and has historically been a minor component of the allocated allowance at december 31 2002 57 of allocated reserves and 38 of the total allowance is related to this potential risk any provision necessary to cover this exposure has been included as a component of the company’s provision for loan losses while coverage of one year’s losses is often adequate particularly for homogeneous pools of loans and leases the time period covered by the allowance may vary by portfolio based on the company’s best estimate of the inherent losses in the entire portfolio as of the evaluation date to mitigate imprecision and incorporate the range of probable outcomes inherent in estimates of expected credit losses the allocated component of the allowance is supplemented by an unallocated component the unallocated component also incorporates the company’s judgmental determination of risks inherent in portfolio composition or economic uncertainties and other subjective factors including industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments that have not yet resulted in changes to individual loan grades therefore the ratio of the allocated to the unallocated components within the total allowance for loan losses may fluctuate from period to period the allocated and unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that would adequately cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories the adequacy of the allowance must be considered in its entirety 78   the company’s determination of the level of the allowance and correspondingly the provision for loan losses rests upon various judgments and assumptions including 1 general economic conditions 2 loan portfolio composition 3 prior loan loss experience 4 the evaluation of credit risk related to both individual borrowers and pools of homogenous loans 5 periodic use of sensitivity analysis and expected loss simulation modeling and 6 the company’s ongoing examination processes and that of its regulators the company has an internal risk analysis and review staff that continuously reviews loan quality and reports the results of its examinations to executive management and the board of directors such reviews also assist management in establishing the level of the allowance in addition the company periodically evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses using a statistical loss model like all national banks subsidiary national banks continue to be subject to examination by their primary regulator the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and some have occ examiners in residence these examinations occur throughout the year and target various activities of the subsidiary national banks including both the loan grading system and specific segments of the loan portfolio for example commercial real estate and shared national credits in addition to the subsidiary national banks being examined by the occ the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries are examined by the federal reserve board the company considers the allowance for loan losses of 382 billion adequate to cover losses inherent in loans loan commitments and standby and other letters of credit at december 31 2002

the company expands its business in part by acquiring banking institutions and
other companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature the company
continues to explore opportunities to acquire banking institutions and other
financial services companies discussions are continually being carried on
related to such possible acquisitions the company cannot predict whether or on
what terms such discussions will result in further acquisitions as a matter of
policy the company generally does not comment on such discussions or possible
acquisitions until a definitive acquisition agreement has been signed

competition

the financial services industry is highly competitive the companys
subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings
and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking
companies insurance companies and money market and mutual fund companies they
also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage
houses and insurance companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries
of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy the
benefits of fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures

securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding
companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions acquisitions of
this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which the
company conducts business the financial services industry is also likely to
become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies
to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the
importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the
transfer of funds between parties

other subsidiaries its principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common
and preferred stock and principal and interest on its debt is dividends from its
subsidiaries various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations
limit the amount of dividends the parents subsidiary banks and certain other
subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval for information about the
restrictions applicable to the parents subsidiary banks see note 3 cash loan
and dividend restrictions to financial statements included in the 2001 annual
report to stockholders

federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the parents
subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting
their businesses the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition
of the bank in question could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice the
ability of the parents subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is
currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and
capital guidelines

holding company structure

transfer of funds from subsidiary banks the parents subsidiary banks are
subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or
other items of value from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank
subsidiaries including affiliates in socalled covered transactions in
general covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit
investments and asset purchases as well as other transactions involving the
transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of
an affiliate unless an exemption applies covered transactions by a subsidiary
bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary banks capital
and surplus and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the
aggregate to 20 of the subsidiary banks capital and surplus also loans and
extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured in
specified amounts a banks transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also
generally required to be on arms length terms

source of strength the frb has a policy that a bank holding company is expected
to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its
subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to
support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when
the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support

the occ may order the assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its
national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired if the parent failed to pay
the assessment within three months the occ could order the sale of the parents
stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency

capital loans by the parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in
right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary
bank in addition in the event of the parents bankruptcy any commitment by
the parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain

the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and
entitled to a priority of payment

depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act fdi act provides that
in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository
institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims
of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for
administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other
general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository
institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will
have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the
parent with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured
depository institution

liability of commonly controlled institutions all of the parents banks are
insured by the fdic fdicinsured depository institutions can be held liable for
any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic due to the
default of an fdicinsured depository institution controlled by the same bank
holding company and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an fdicinsured
depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by
the same bank holding company default means generally the appointment of a
conservator or receiver in danger of default means generally the existence of
certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence
of regulatory assistance

capital requirements

the parent is subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed
by the frb which are substantially similar to the capital requirements and
guidelines imposed by the frb the occ and the fdic on depository institutions
under their jurisdictions for information about these capital requirements and
guidelines see note 22 riskbased capital to financial statements included in
the 2001 annual report to stockholders

the frb may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose
circumstances warrant it for example holding companies experiencing internal
growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions
substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance
on intangible assets also the frb considers a tangible tier 1 leverage ratio
deducting all intangibles and other indications of capital strength in
evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities

effective april 1 2002 new frb rules will govern the regulatory treatment of
merchant banking investments and certain other equity investments including
investments made by the companys venture capital subsidiaries in nonfinancial
companies held by bank holding companies the rules generally impose a capital
charge that increases incrementally as the banking organizations level of
concentration in equity investments increases an 8 tier 1 capital deduction
would apply on covered investments that in total represent up to 15 of an
organizations tier 1 capital for covered investments that total more than 25
of the organizations tier 1 capital a top marginal charge of 25 would be
established the company does not expect the new rules to have a significant
impact on the company

frb fdic and occ rules also require the company to incorporate market and
interest rate risk components into their riskbased capital standards under the
market risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market
risk related to a financial institutions ongoing trading activities

in december 2001 the basel committee on banking supervision updated the status
of the revised draft basel capital accord issued earlier in 2001 the basel
committee continues to evaluate certain aspects of the draft accord and expects
to issue a new consultative package during 2002 the draft basel accord
incorporates three pillars that address a minimum capital requirements
b supervisory review which relates to an institutions capital adequacy and
internal assessment process and c market discipline through effective
disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking practices embodied within these
pillars are aspects of risk assessment that relate to credit risk interest rate
risk operational risk among others and certain proposed approaches by the
basel committee to complete such assessments may be considered complex the
company continues to monitor the status of the basel accord which may be
finalized by the end of 2002 with required implementation of the new framework
not anticipated prior to 2005

from time to time the frb and the federal financial institutions examination
council ffiec propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of
risk based capital guidelines and related reporting instructions such proposals
or interpretations could if implemented in the future affect the companys
reported capital ratios and net riskadjusted assets

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of
depository institutions the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies
to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions
for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally
to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and
executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against
institutions that fail to meet such standards

the fdi act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective
action with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet
minimum capital requirements a depository institutions treatment for purposes
of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital
levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as
established by regulation

deposit insurance assessments

through the bank insurance fund bif the fdic insures the deposits of the
parents depository institution subsidiaries up to prescribed limits for each
depositor the amount of fdic assessments paid by each bif member institution is
based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios
and other factors specifically the assessment rate is based on the
institutions capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category an
institutions capitalization risk category is based on the fdics determination
of whether the institution is well capitalized adequately capitalized or less
than adequately capitalized an institutions supervisory subgroup category is
based on the fdics assessment of the financial condition of the institution and
the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be
required

the bif assessment rate currently ranges from zero to 27 cents per 100 of
domestic deposits the bif assessment rate for the parents depository
institutions currently is zero the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment
rate schedule on a semiannual basis an increase in the bif assessment rate
could have a material adverse effect on the parents earnings depending on the
amount of the increase the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository
institutions deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the
institutions financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution
has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable

rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institutions
regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of the
parents subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse effect
on the parents earnings depending on the collective size of the particular
institutions involved

all fdicinsured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to
provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing
corporation a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal
housing finance board the bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds were
issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation
fdicinsured depository institutions paid approximately 19 cents per 100 of
bifassessable deposits in 2001 the fdic established the fico assessment rate
effective for the first quarter of 2002 at approximately 18 cents annually per
100 of bifassessable deposits

fiscal and monetary policies

the companys business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and
monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies the company is
particularly affected by the policies of the frb which regulates the supply of
money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy
available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in united states
government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of
depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against
depository institutions deposits and d imposing or changing reserve
requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these
methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the
availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged
on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the frb may have a material
effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition

privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act

federal banking regulators as required under the grammleachbliley act the
glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial
institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated
third parties the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers
and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain
personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of
the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified
financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors

future legislation

various legislation including proposals to change substantially the financial
institution regulatory system is from time to time introduced in congress this
legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the
company in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted this legislation
could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand
permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings
associations credit unions and other financial institutions the company
cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and if
enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the
companys business results of operations or financial condition

analysis of changes in net interest income

the following table allocates the changes in net interest income on a
taxableequivalent basis to changes in either average balances or average rates
for both interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities because of
the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period it is not
possible to precisely allocate such changes between volume and rate for this
table changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated to
these categories in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and
average rate

the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total nonaccrual loans was 229
and 311 at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively this ratio may
fluctuate significantly from period to period due to such factors as the mix
of loan types in the portfolio the prospects of borrowers and the value and
marketability of collateral as well as for the nonaccrual portfolio taken as
a whole wide variances from period to period in

terms of delinquency and relationship of book to contractual principal
balance classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate
that the principal of a loan is uncollectible in whole or in part
consequently the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans
taken alone and without taking into account numerous additional factors is
not a reliable indicator of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses
indicators of the credit quality of the companys loan portfolio and the
method of determining the allowance for loan losses are discussed below and

     available for any of the above listed loan categories

see note 5 loans and allowance for loan losses to financial statements
included in the 2001 annual report to stockholders for the description of the
process used by the company to determine the adequacy and the components
allocated and unallocated of the allowance for loan losses

                                       14

page

at december 31 2001 the allowance for loan losses was 3761 million or
218 of total loans compared with 3719 million or 231 at december 31
2000 during 2001 the net provision for loan losses approximated
chargeoffs the components of the allowance allocated and unallocated are
shown in the table on the previous page the allocated component increased to
2632 million at december 31 2001 from 2254 million at december 31 2000
while the unallocated decreased to 1129 million at december 31 2001 from
1465 million at december 31 2000 at december 31 2001 the unallocated
portion of the allowance amounted to 30 of the total allowance compared
with 39 at december 31 2000

the 378 million increase in the allocated component of the allowance was
attributable to growth in the loan portfolio along with a shift in the
composition of risk in the portfolio during 2001 approximately 160 million
of this increase is attributable to loan growth the remaining 218 million
increase reflects additions to allocated allowances caused by a change in
risk assumptions in the commercial and wholesale lines of business and higher
estimated loss rates in the retail line of business changes in allocated
loan loss allowances arrived at through this methodology reflect managements
judgment concerning the effect of recent economic activity on portfolio
performance analyzing the movements in the allocated allowance strictly from
a loan volume perspective indicates that had the ratio of allocated
allowance to loans outstanding remained flat with the 2000 ratio of 140
the allocated allowance would have increased by approximately 161 million
as loans outstanding grew by 11 billion during the year

there were no material changes in estimation methods and assumptions for the
allowance that took place during 2001

the company considers the allowance for loan losses of 3761 million adequate
to cover losses inherent in loans loan commitments and standby and other
letters of credit at december 31 2001

the foregoing discussion contains forwardlooking statements about the adequacy
of the companys allowance for loan losses these forwardlooking statements are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties a number of factorsmany of
which are beyond the companys controlcould cause actual losses to be more
than estimated losses for a discussion of some of the other factors that could
cause actual losses to be more than estimated losses see factors that may
affect future results in the financial review section of the 2001 annual
report to stockholders

competition

the financial services industry is highly competitive the companys
subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks savings
and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking
companies insurance companies and money market and mutual fund companies they
also face increased competition from nonbanking institutions such as brokerage
houses and insurance companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries
of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy the
benefits of fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures

effective march 13 2000 securities firms and insurance companies that elect to
become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial
institutions this may significantly change the competitive environment in which
the company conducts business the financial services industry is also likely to
become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies
to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the
importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the
transfer of funds between parties

levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors as
established by regulation

companys depository institution subsidiaries up to prescribed limits for each
depositor the amount of fdic assessments paid by each bif member institution is
based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios
and other factors specifically the assessment rate is based on the
institutions capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category an
institutions capitalization risk category is based on the fdics determination
of whether the institution is well capitalized adequately capitalized or less
than adequately capitalized an institutions supervisory subgroup category is
based on the fdics assessment of the financial condition of the institution and
the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be
required

domestic deposits the bif assessment rate for the companys depository
institutions currently is zero the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment
rate schedule on a semiannual basis an increase in the bif assessment rate

institutions financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution
has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule

future legislation

various legislation including proposals to change substantially the financial
institution regulatory system is from time to time introduced in congress this
legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the
company in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted this legislation
could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand
permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings
associations credit unions and other financial institutions the company
cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and if
enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the
companys business results of operations or financial condition

analysis of changes in net interest income

the following table allocates the changes in net interest income on a
taxableequivalent basis to changes in either average balances or average
rates for both interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities
because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any
period it is not possible to precisely allocate such changes between volume
and rate for this table changes that are not solely due to either volume or
rate are allocated to these categories in proportion to the percentage
changes in average volume and average rate

the sec requires the company to present the ratio of the allowance for loan
losses to total nonaccrual loans this ratio was 311 and 462 at december 31
2000 and 1999 respectively this ratio may fluctuate significantly from period
to period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio the
prospects of borrowers and the value and marketability of collateral as well as
for the nonaccrual portfolio taken as a whole wide variances from period to
period in terms of delinquency and relationship of book to contractual principal
balance classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate
that the principal of a loan is uncollectible in whole or in part consequently
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans taken alone and
without taking into account numerous additional factors is not a reliable
indicator of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses indicators of the
credit quality of the companys loan portfolio and the method of determining the
allowance for loan losses are discussed below and in greater detail in the 2000

see note 5 to financial statements in the 2000 annual report incorporated by
reference herein for the description of the process used by the company to
determine the adequacy and the components allocated and unallocated of the
allowance for loan losses

at december 31 2000 the allowance for loan losses was 3719 million or 231
of total loans compared with 3344 million or 251 at december 31 1999
during 2000 net provision for loan losses exceeded the chargeoffs by 110
million the addition of 265 million of allowances related to business
combinations in 2000 accounted for the majority of the increase of 375 million
in the reserve year over year the components of the allowance allocated and
unallocated are shown in the table on the previous page the allocated
component increased to 2254 million from 1907 million while the unallocated
component grew to 1465 million from 1437 million as of december 31 2000
and 1999 respectively at december 31 2000 the unallocated portion of the
allowance amounted to 39 of the total allowance compared with 43 at december
31 1999

the 347 million increase in the allocated component of the allowance was
entirely due to growth in the loan portfolio analyzing the movements in the
allocated reserve strictly from a loan volume perspective indicates that had
the ratio of allocated reserves to loans outstanding remained flat with the 1999
ratio of 143 allocated reserves would have increased by approximately 395
million as loans outstanding grew by 28 billion during the year however due
to a shift in portfolio composition the higher volume increased the allocated
reserve by only 366 million as relatively higherrisk foreign loans grew at a
slower pace than other lowerrisk portfolio segments

lower allocated allowance to loans outstanding ratios in the residential
mortgage and other real estate mortgage portfolios were substantially offset by
higher allocated allowance to loans outstanding ratios in the other consumer and
foreign loan portfolios on a net basis marginally lower allocated reserve
ratios resulted in a reduction of roughly 19 million in allocated reserves
primarily a reflection of modestly lower projected loss rates in the loan
portfolio

there were no material changes in estimation methods and assumptions for the
allowance that took place during 2000

the company considers the allowance for loan losses of 3719 million adequate
to cover losses inherent in loans loan commitments and standby and other
letters of credit at december 31 2000

the foregoing discussion contains forwardlooking statements about the adequacy
of the companys reserves for loan losses these forwardlooking statements are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties a number of factorsmany of
which are beyond the companys controlcould cause actual losses to be more
than estimated losses for a discussion of some of the other factors that could
cause actual losses to be more than estimated losses see factors that may
affect future results in the financial review section of the 2000 annual
report to stockholders incorporated by reference herein
