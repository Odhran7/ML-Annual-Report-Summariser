although global economic conditions have been improving despite the continuation of the covid19 pandemic any ongoing negative economic impacts arising from the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the pandemic including as a result of additional waves or variants of the covid19 disease or the emergence of other diseases that have similar outcomes could have significant adverse effects on jpmorgan chase’s businesses results of operations and financial condition including 

• recognition of chargeoffs and increases in the allowance for credit losses including any delayed recognition of chargeoffs due to the impact of government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers 

• material impacts on the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets 

• downgrades in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings 

• constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels of deposits increases in riskweighted assets “rwa” related to supporting client activities downgrades in client credit ratings regulatory actions or other factors any or all of which could require jpmorgan chase to take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise would under its liquidity and capital management strategies and 

• the possibility that significant portions of jpmorgan chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines shelterinplace arrangements government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic negatively affects jpmorgan chase’s businesses results of operations and financial condition as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted including 

• the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic 

• the effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines and their availability in certain regions 

• actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and 

• the effect that the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the pandemic may have on the pace of economic growth inflation the strength of labor markets particularly in light of the expiration of government assistance programs and the potential for changes in consumer 



behavior that could have longerterm impacts on certain economic sectors 

in addition jpmorgan chases participation in us government programs designed to support individuals households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic whether directly or indirectly including on behalf of customers and clients or by affiliated entities newlyacquired businesses or companies in which jpmorgan chase has made principal investments could be criticized and subject jpmorgan chase to 

• increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny 

• negative publicity and 

• increased exposure to litigation 

any or all of which could increase jpmorgan chase’s operational legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation to the extent that the covid19 pandemic adversely affects jpmorgan chase’s business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below 

regulatory 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are highly regulated and the laws rules and regulations that apply to jpmorgan chase have a significant impact on its business and operations 

jpmorgan chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide jpmorgan chase must comply with the laws rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business regulation of the financial services industry is extensive 

the regulation and supervision of financial services firms has expanded significantly over an extended period of time the increased regulation and supervision of jpmorgan chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations jpmorgan chase could be required to make further changes to its business and operations in response to expanded supervision or to new or changed laws rules and regulations these types of developments could result in jpmorgan chase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with applicable laws rules and regulations which could reduce its profitability furthermore jpmorgan chase’s entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require jpmorgan chase to comply with additional laws rules and regulations 

in response to new and existing laws rules and regulations and expanded supervision jpmorgan chase has in the past been and could in the future be required to 

• limit the products and services that it offers 

• reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its marketmaking activities 

• refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue 

• pay higher taxes assessments levies or other governmental charges including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations 

• incur losses with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers 

• dispose of certain assets and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous 

• impose restrictions on certain business activities or 

• increase the prices that it charges for products and services which could reduce the demand for them 

in particular jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in laws rules and regulations or changes in the application interpretation or enforcement of laws rules and regulations that 

• proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on certain financial services activities 

• impose new requirements relating to the impact of business activities on environmental social and governance “esg” concerns the management of risks associated with those concerns and the offering of products intended to achieve esgrelated objectives or 

• introduce changes to antitrust or anticompetition laws rules and regulations that adversely affect the business activities of jpmorgan chase 

differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

the content and application of laws rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates and other criteria for example 

• larger firms such as jpmorgan chase are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation 

• financial technology companies and other nontraditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms or 

• the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction 

these types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in jpmorgan chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation especially with respect to unregulated financial products 



part i 

there can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the us and in other countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase that may be subject to those enhanced regulations 

legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the us could require jpmorgan chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements these include laws rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to 

• the establishment of locallybased intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries 

• requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locallybased subsidiaries 

• the separation or “ring fencing” of core banking products and services from markets activities 

• the resolution of financial institutions 

• requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties “ccps” 

• position limits and reporting rules for derivatives 

• governance and accountability regimes 

• conduct of business and control requirements and 

• restrictions on compensation 

these types of differences inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require jpmorgan chase to 

• divest assets or restructure its operations 

• absorb increased operational capital and liquidity costs 

• change the prices that it charges for its products and services 

• curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients 

• curtail other business opportunities including acquisitions or principal investments that it otherwise would have pursued or 

• incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks 

any or all of these factors could harm jpmorgan chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws rules and regulations or supervisory oversight or harm jpmorgan chase’s businesses results of operations and profitability 

resolving regulatory investigations can subject jpmorgan chase to significant penalties and collateral consequences and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions jpmorgan chase has paid significant fines provided other monetary relief incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies jpmorgan chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in jpmorgan chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation or needing to comply with other restrictions 

in connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions certain regulators have required jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution these types of admissions can lead to 

• greater exposure in litigation 

• damage to reputation 

• disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers or in specific jurisdictions or 

• other direct and indirect adverse effects 

furthermore us government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution including 

• loss of clients customers and business 

• restrictions on offering certain products or services and 

• losing permission to operate certain businesses either temporarily or permanently 

jpmorgan chase expects that 

• it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions 

• regulators will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions and 



• regulators will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against jpmorgan chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions 

if jpmorgan chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators it could be required to among other things 

• enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions 

• pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments or 

• accept material regulatory restrictions on or changes in the management of its businesses 

in these circumstances jpmorgan chase could also become subject to other sanctions or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action 

jpmorgan chase can face greater risks of noncompliance and incur higher operational and compliance costs under laws rules and regulations relating to antimoney laundering economic sanctions embargo programs and anticorruption 

jpmorgan chase must comply with laws rules and regulations throughout the world relating to antimoney laundering economic sanctions embargo programs and anticorruption which can increase its risks of noncompliance and costs associated with the implementation and maintenance of complex compliance programs a violation of any of these legal and regulatory requirements could subject jpmorgan chase or individual employees to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties in addition certain national and multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside the us have adopted laws rules or regulations that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as jpmorgan chase from complying with laws rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risks of noncompliance in those jurisdictions 

jpmorgan chase’s operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks  

jpmorgan chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable including with respect to 

• the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions 

• conflicting or ambiguous laws rules and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations 

• uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual intellectual property or other obligations 

• difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and 

• the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies 

if the application of the laws rules and regulations in a particular country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes this can create a more difficult environment in which jpmorgan chase conducts its business and could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that country for example conducting business could require jpmorgan chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws rules and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures 

there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates and the risk of noncompliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems 

requirements for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase could result in jpmorgan chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses 

jpmorgan chase is required under federal reserve and fdic rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support in the event of material financial distress or failure the agencies’ evaluation of jpmorgan chase’s resolution plan may change and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time any such determinations or modifications could result in jpmorgan chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities which could increase its funding or operational costs or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers 

if the federal reserve and the fdic were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by jpmorgan chase has deficiencies they could jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on jpmorgan chase’s growth activities or operations the agencies could also require that jpmorgan chase restructure reorganize or divest assets or businesses in 



part i 

ways that could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and strategy 

holders of jpmorgan chase  co’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution 

federal reserve rules require that jpmorgan chase  co the “parent company” maintain minimum levels of unsecured external longterm debt and other lossabsorbing capacity with specific terms “eligible ltd” for purposes of recapitalizing jpmorgan chase’s operating subsidiaries if the parent company were to enter into a resolution either 

• in a bankruptcy proceeding under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code or 

• in a receivership administered by the fdic under title ii of the doddfrank act “title ii” 

if the parent company were to enter into a resolution holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company will absorb the losses of the parent company and its subsidiaries 

the preferred “single point of entry” strategy under jpmorgan chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the parent company would enter bankruptcy proceedings jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner as a result the parent company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the parent company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors including holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority as determined by statute and secured creditors of the parent company 

accordingly in a resolution of the parent company in bankruptcy holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of the parent company would realize value only to the extent available to the parent company as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank na and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the parent company have been fully repaid 

the fdic has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution such as the parent company under title ii however the fdic has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy 

if the parent company were to approach or enter into a resolution none of the parent company the federal reserve or the fdic is obligated to follow jpmorgan chase’s preferred resolution strategy and losses to holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the 

parent company under whatever strategy is ultimately followed could be greater than they might have been under jpmorgan chase’s preferred strategy 

political 

economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can negatively impact jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

political developments in the us and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which jpmorgan chase operates its businesses certain monetary fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could significantly affect us and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets including 

• monetary policies and actions taken by the federal reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities including any sustained largescale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions 

• fiscal policies including with respect to taxation and spending 

• actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of the covid19 pandemic as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken 

• isolationist foreign policies 

• an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other geopolitical instabilities 

• economic sanctions 

• the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies or 

• other governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures 

these types of political developments and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments could 

• erode investor confidence in the us economy and financial markets which could potentially undermine the status of the us dollar as a safe haven currency 

• provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations 

• lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the us federal national mortgage association and the us federal home loan mortgage corporation together the “us gses” 

• increase concerns about whether the us government will be funded and its outstanding debt serviced at any particular time 

• result in periodic shutdowns of the us government or governments in other countries 



• increase investor reliance on actions by the federal reserve or other central banks or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole 

• adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which jpmorgan chase does business or 

• cause jpmorgan chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue 

these factors could lead to 

• slower growth rates rising inflation or recession 

• greater market volatility 

• a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads 

• erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets 

• diminished investor and consumer confidence 

• lower investment growth 

• largescale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the us and other countries 

• reduced commercial activity among trading partners 

• the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country 

• the possible departure of a country from or the dissolution of a political or economic alliance or treaty 

• potential expropriation or nationalization of assets or 

• other market dislocations including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions 

any of these potential outcomes could cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses on its marketmaking positions or in its investment portfolio reduce its liquidity and capital levels increase credit risk hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers and weaken its results of operations and financial condition 

market 

economic and market events and conditions can materially affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and investment and marketmaking positions 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following 

• investor consumer and business sentiment 

• events that reduce confidence in the financial markets 

• inflation or deflation 

• high unemployment or conversely a tightening labor market 

• the availability and cost of capital liquidity and credit 

• levels and volatility of interest rates credit spreads and market prices for currencies equities and commodities and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility 

• the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities cyber attacks climate change natural disasters severe weather conditions health emergencies the spread of infectious diseases epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond jpmorgan chase’s control and 

• the health of the us and global economies 

all of these are affected by global economic market and political events and conditions as well as regulatory restrictions 

in addition jpmorgan chase’s investment portfolio and marketmaking businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events including 

• severe declines in asset values 

• unexpected credit events 

• unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa 

• the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to marketmaking and investment portfolio positions or 

• other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a financial instrument 

if jpmorgan chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from marketmaking activities this could reduce jpmorgan chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by us and global economic conditions including 

• personal and household income distribution 

• unemployment or underemployment 

• prolonged periods of exceptionally low interest rates 

• housing prices 

• the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services 

• consumer and small business confidence levels and 

• changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt 



part i 

heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts in addition sustained low growth low or negative interest rates inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses 

adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce jpmorgan chase’s earnings these consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment or where high levels of consumer debt such as outstanding student loans could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations 

jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers including 

• policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance education immigration employment status and housing and 

• policies aimed at the economy more broadly such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income 

in addition governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could if enacted into law encourage certain of jpmorgan chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and chargeoffs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers 

unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses 

in jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that jpmorgan chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients and therefore the revenue that jpmorgan chase receives from those transactions these factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that jpmorgan chase manages such as loan syndications or securities underwritings furthermore if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur the profitability of jpmorgan chase’s capital markets businesses including its loan syndication securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities could be reduced to the extent that those businesses 

• earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions or 

• dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices 

an adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors could have a material adverse effect on clients of jpmorgan chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses jpmorgan chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in or are dependent on any sector of the economy that is under stress 

the fees that jpmorgan chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions for example higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that jpmorgan chase manages or holds under custody which in turn could affect jpmorgan chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody similarly adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from jpmorgan chase funds or accounts or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a jpmorgan chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance 

an economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale clients and thereby diminish jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations for example the businesses of certain of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients sustained adverse economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which in turn could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans these consequences could result in jpmorgan chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses higher delinquencies defaults and chargeoffs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio thereby reducing jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses 



changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of jpmorgan chase’s revenue and income streams related to its traditional banking and funding activities 

in general a low or negative interest rate environment may cause 

• net interest margins to be compressed which could reduce the amounts that jpmorgan chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higheryielding instruments 

• unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior which could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s broader asset and liability management strategy 

• jpmorgan chase to reduce the amount of deposits that it accepts from customers and clients which could result in lower revenues and 

• a reduction in the value of jpmorgan chase’s mortgage servicing rights “msrs” asset thereby decreasing revenues 

when credit spreads widen it becomes more expensive for jpmorgan chase to borrow jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to jpmorgan chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads will affect positively or negatively jpmorgan chase’s earnings on certain liabilities such as derivatives that are recorded at fair value 

when interest rates are increasing jpmorgan chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income however higher interest rates can also lead to 

• fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans 

• losses on underwriting exposures 

• the loss of deposits including in the event that jpmorgan chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior 

• unrealized marktomarket losses on availableforsale “afs” securities held in the investment securities portfolio 

• lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of shortterm and longterm borrowings 

• less liquidity in the financial markets and 

• higher funding costs 

all of these outcomes could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment 

performance on loans within jpmorgan chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates if borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments thereby causing jpmorgan chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans 

jpmorgan chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments 

the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations market volatility illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods in light of factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments in addition at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments the price that jpmorgan chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets which may have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management and monitoring processes including its stress testing framework seek to quantify and control jpmorgan chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves however jpmorgan chase’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective and it could incur significant losses if extreme market events were to occur 

credit 

jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients counterparties custodians and ccps 

jpmorgan chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations financial institutions asset managers hedge funds securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the us many of these transactions expose jpmorgan chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties and can involve jpmorgan chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults jpmorgan chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations 

a default by or the financial or operational failure of a ccp through which jpmorgan chase executes contracts would require jpmorgan chase to replace those contracts thereby 



part i 

increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses in addition jpmorgan chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a ccp in which jpmorgan chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the ccp because of requirements that each member of the ccp absorb a portion of those losses furthermore jpmorgan chase can be subject to bearing its share of nondefault losses incurred by a ccp including losses from custodial settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches 

as part of its clearing services activities jpmorgan chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral jpmorgan chase is also exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management clearing custodial and other transaction services to those clients if a client for which jpmorgan chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent jpmorgan chase may incur losses become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more ccps the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or be subject to regulatory investigations all of the foregoing events can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and litigation costs and jpmorgan chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses 

transactions with government entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities can expose jpmorgan chase to enhanced sovereign credit operational and reputation risks government entities may among other things claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government these types of actions have in the past caused and could in the future cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction 

in addition local laws rules and regulations could limit jpmorgan chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreedupon payments which could subject jpmorgan chase to losses 

disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral the disposition of those disputes could cause jpmorgan chase to incur unexpected transaction operational and legal costs or result in credit losses these consequences can also impair jpmorgan chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities or cause harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

the financial or operational failure of a significant market participant such as a major financial institution or a ccp or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant can have a cascading effect within the financial markets jpmorgan chase’s businesses could be 

significantly disrupted by such an event particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting and jpmorgan chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with and credit exposure to such a significant market participant 

jpmorgan chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity jpmorgan chase’s credit risk may be further increased when 

• jpmorgan chase fails to realize the fair value of the collateral it holds 

• collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it or 

• counterparties are unable to post collateral whether for operational or other reasons 

furthermore disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and jpmorgan chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral 

jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk 

jpmorgan chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties 

• engage in similar or related businesses or in businesses in related industries 

• do business in the same geographic region or 

• have business profiles models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions 

for example a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar related or dependent industries this type of interrelationship could exacerbate jpmorgan chase’s credit liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses including fair value losses in its marketmaking businesses and investment portfolios in addition jpmorgan chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators 

similarly challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries wherever located these conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of 



jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or nonbank competitors heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industrywide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to lesscreditworthy borrowers if large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans whether due to weak credit profiles an economic downturn or other factors this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to jpmorgan chase and result in higher chargeoffs and other creditrelated losses more broadly widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the us economy and jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment 

if jpmorgan chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of rwa that jpmorgan chase holds on its balance sheet these factors could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s capital position funding costs and the profitability of its businesses 

liquidity 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as 

• marketwide illiquidity or disruption 

• unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements including as a result of changes in laws rules and regulations 

• inability to sell assets or to sell assets at favorable times or prices 

• default by a ccp or other significant market participant 

• unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral 

• unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lendingrelated commitments and 

• lack of market or customer confidence in jpmorgan chase or financial institutions in general 

a reduction in jpmorgan chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control for example during periods of market stress low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher 

funding costs for jpmorgan chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity 

jpmorgan chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lowercost sources of funding such as deposits and borrowings from federal home loan banks is reduced alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability jpmorgan chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that jpmorgan chase may take in order to 

• satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements 

• address obligations under its resolution plan or 

• satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the us relating to the prepositioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities 

more generally if jpmorgan chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries and thereby adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company that holds the stock of jpmorgan chase bank na and an intermediate holding company jpmorgan chase holdings llc the “ihc” the ihc in turn generally holds the stock of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries other than jpmorgan chase bank na and its subsidiaries the ihc also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding company 

the holding company is obligated to contribute to the ihc substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock 

the ability of jpmorgan chase bank na and the ihc to make payments to the holding company is also limited jpmorgan chase bank na is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions as well as capital adequacy requirements such as the supplementary leverage ratio “slr” and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company the ihc is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by jpmorgan chase’s management or board of directors 

as a result of these arrangements the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from jpmorgan chase bank na and dividends and borrowings from the ihc these limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to 

• pay interest on its debt securities 



part i 

• pay dividends on its equity securities 

• redeem or repurchase outstanding securities and 

• fulfill its other payment obligations 

these arrangements could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the ihc is subject 

reductions in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies rating agencies evaluate both general and firmspecific and industryspecific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution including 

• expected future profitability 

• risk management practices 

• legal expenses 

• ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and nonbank subsidiaries 

• regulatory developments 

• assumptions about government support and 

• economic and geopolitical developments 

jpmorgan chase closely monitors and manages to the extent that it is able factors that could influence its credit ratings however there is no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future furthermore any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when jpmorgan chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

a reduction in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings could curtail jpmorgan chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways including 

• reducing its access to capital markets 

• materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities 

• triggering additional collateral or funding requirements and 

• decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to jpmorgan chase 

any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries this could in turn adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries 

the reform and replacement of benchmark rates could adversely affect financial instruments issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase and expose it to litigation and other disputes 

interest rate equity foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” including those in widespread and longstanding use have been the subject of ongoing international national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives for reform including 

• changes to the rules and methodologies under which certain benchmarks are administered 

• initiatives designed to discourage or prohibit the use of certain benchmarks by market participants 

• the introduction of alternative reference rates to be used by market participants in lieu of certain benchmarks and 

• legislative proposals and actions providing for the replacement of reference rates under existing contracts and instruments that are linked to certain benchmarks with alternative reference rates  

some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration these and other reforms relating to benchmarks could 

• cause certain benchmarks to be substantially modified or to be permanently discontinued 

• lead to disruptions in the financial markets including in connection with the transition to alternative reference rates 

• give rise to litigation and other disputes 

• cause reputational harm to the extent that operational and technology systems are not sufficiently prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates or 

• have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated 

any of these developments and any future initiatives to regulate reform or change the administration of benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on value of and market for loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark including those issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase 

changes in the manner in which certain benchmarks are administered or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of those benchmarks could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of those benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to those benchmarks such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks trigger further changes in the rules or methodologies under which certain benchmarks are 



administered or lead to the discontinuation of certain benchmarks 

regulators industry bodies and other market participants in the us and other countries continue to engage in initiatives to develop introduce and encourage the use of alternative reference rates to replace certain benchmarks and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are gaining acceptance among market participants however there is no assurance that 

• any of these new rates will be similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmarks that they seek to replace 

• arrangements by market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the transition to alternative reference rates will be fully effective or 

• a particular alternative reference rate will be widely accepted by market participants or that market acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the introduction of other reference rates 

if a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative reference rate has not been successfully introduced or widely accepted within the market this could result in significant adverse effects on the financial markets for example vast amounts of loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the london interbank offered rate “libor” benchmark ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor has announced that the publication of the principal tenors of us dollar libor will cease after june 30 2023 and significant progress has been made by regulators industry bodies and market participants to introduce and implement the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as a replacement rate for us dollar libor however if an alternative reference rate such as sofr has not achieved sufficient market acceptance when the publication of the principal tenors of us dollar libor is discontinued or if market participants have not otherwise implemented effective transitional arrangements to address that discontinuation this could result in widespread dislocation in the financial markets volatility in the pricing of securities derivatives and other instruments and the suppression of capital markets activities all of which could have a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations and on us dollar liborlinked securities credit or other instruments which are issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients customers counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from us dollar libor and other benchmark rates to replacement rates including claims that jpmorgan chase has 

• treated clients customers counterparties or investors unfairly or caused them to experience losses higher financing costs or lower returns on investments 

• failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that jpmorgan chase has sold to its clients and customers or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest 

• made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose in connection with the transition from benchmark rates 

• engaged in anticompetitive behavior or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates or 

• disadvantaged clients customers counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments 

these types of claims could subject jpmorgan chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes and harm its reputation 

capital 

maintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact jpmorgan chase’s ability to support business activities meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders 

jpmorgan chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements including leverage and riskbased capital requirements in addition as a globally systemically important bank “gsib” jpmorgan chase is required to hold additional capital buffers including a gsib surcharge a scb and a countercyclical buffer each of which is reassessed at least annually the amount of capital that jpmorgan chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverageand riskbased requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as 

• actions by banking regulators including changes in laws rules and regulations 

• actions taken by the federal reserve or the us government in response to the economic effects of systemic events such as the actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic which led to an expansion of the federal reserve balance sheet growth in deposits held by jpmorgan chase and other us financial institutions and consequently an increase in leverage exposure and the gsib surcharge 

• changes in the composition of jpmorgan chase’s balance sheet or developments that could increase risk weighted assets such as increased market risk customer delinquencies client credit rating downgrades or other factors and 



part i 

• increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the federal reserve under the comprehensive capital analysis and review which could increase jpmorgan chase’s scb 

any failure by or inability of jpmorgan chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements could have an adverse impact on jpmorgan chase’s shareholders such as 

• reducing the amount of common stock that jpmorgan chase is permitted to repurchase 

• requiring the issuance of or prohibiting the redemption of capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with jpmorgan chase’s capital management strategy 

• constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock or 

• curtailing jpmorgan chase’s business activities or operations 

operational 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses rely on the ability of jpmorgan chase’s financial accounting transaction execution data processing and other operational systems to process record monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis and to do so accurately quickly and securely in addition to proper design installation maintenance and training the effective functioning of jpmorgan chase’s operational systems depends on 

• the quality of the information contained in those systems as inaccurate outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information and 

• the ability of jpmorgan chase to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements 

jpmorgan chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors custodians and other market participants including clearing and payment systems ccps securities exchanges and data processing security and technology companies including those that provide cloud computing services 

the ineffectiveness failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which jpmorgan chase depends including due to a systems malfunction cyberbreach or other systems failure could result in unfavorable ripple 

effects in the financial markets and for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including 

• delays or other disruptions in providing services liquidity or information to clients and customers 

• the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required 

• failure to timely settle or confirm transactions 

• the possibility that funds transfers capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended consequences 

• financial losses including due to losssharing requirements of ccps payment systems or other market infrastructures or as possible restitution to clients and customers 

• higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable 

• client or customer dissatisfaction with jpmorgan chase’s products and services 

• regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions against jpmorgan chase 

• loss of confidence in the ability of jpmorgan chase or financial institutions generally to protect against and withstand operational disruptions or 

• harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

as the speed frequency volume interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase it can become more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade jpmorgan chase’s operational systems and infrastructure especially due to the heightened risks that 

• attempts by third parties to defraud jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers may increase evolve or become more complex particularly during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty 

• errors made by jpmorgan chase or another market participant whether inadvertent or malicious cause widespread system disruption 

• isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound or migrate to other systems over time to become larger issues 

• failures in synchronization or encryption software or degraded performance of microprocessors could cause disruptions in operational systems or the inability of systems to communicate with each other and 

• third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights 

if jpmorgan chase’s operational systems or those of newlyacquired businesses or of external parties on which 



jpmorgan chase’s businesses depend are unable to meet the requirements of jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings jpmorgan chase could be materially and adversely affected 

a successful cyber attack affecting jpmorgan chase could cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers 

jpmorgan chase experiences numerous attempted cyber attacks on its computer systems software networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries cybercriminals “hacktivists” ie individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change and others these cyber attacks can take many forms including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code which are commonly referred to as “malware” into jpmorgan chase’s systems these attacks are often designed to 

• obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to jpmorgan chase or its clients customers counterparties or employees 

• manipulate data 

• destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable 

• disrupt sabotage or degrade service on jpmorgan chase’s systems 

• steal money or 

• extort money through the use of socalled “ransomware” 

jpmorgan chase has also experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services 

jpmorgan chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers 

a principal reason that jpmorgan chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate detect or recognize threats to jpmorgan chase’s systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches this is because 

• the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and are increasingly sophisticated and therefore may not be recognized until launched 

• cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including jpmorgan chase’s own employees cybercriminals hacktivists groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally 

• jpmorgan chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which it does business and 

• it is possible that a third party after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected might obtain access to other networks and systems 

the risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as 

• jpmorgan chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internetbased product offerings and its internal use of internetbased products and applications including those that use cloud computing services 

• the acquisition of new businesses and 

• the increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions to facilitate workfromhome arrangements for employees 

in addition a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by jpmorgan chase’s employees 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences including 

• significant disruption of jpmorgan chase’s operations and those of its clients customers and counterparties including losing access to operational systems 

• misappropriation of confidential information of jpmorgan chase or that of its clients customers counterparties employees or regulators 

• disruption of or damage to jpmorgan chase’s systems and those of its clients customers and counterparties 

• the inability or extended delays in the ability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen manipulated or destroyed or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions 

• violations by jpmorgan chase of applicable privacy and other laws 

• financial loss to jpmorgan chase or to its clients customers counterparties or employees 

• loss of confidence in jpmorgan chase’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures 

• dissatisfaction among jpmorgan chase’s clients customers or counterparties 

• significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and 

• harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 



part i 

the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that jpmorgan chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed while such an investigation is ongoing jpmorgan chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack and that damage may continue to spread these factors may inhibit jpmorgan chase’s ability to provide rapid full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients customers counterparties and regulators as well as the public furthermore it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products services and delivery platforms 

when jpmorgan chase launches a new product or service introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services including mobile connectivity electronic trading and cloud computing acquires or invests in a business or makes changes to an existing product service or delivery platform it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes any significant failure in this regard could diminish jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in 

• potential liability to clients counterparties and customers 

• increased operating expenses 

• higher litigation costs including regulatory fines penalties and other sanctions 

• damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

• impairment of jpmorgan chase’s liquidity 

• regulatory intervention or 

• weaker competitive standing 

any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system 

external operational systems with which jpmorgan is connected whether directly or indirectly can be sources of operational risk to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market 

infrastructure with which jpmorgan chase is directly connected but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected similarly retailers data aggregators and other external parties with which jpmorgan chase’s customers do business can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational risk this is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond jpmorgan chase’s security and control systems including through the use of the internet cloud computing services and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services 

if an external party obtains access to customer account data on jpmorgan chase’s systems and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including 

• heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using jpmorgan chase’s systems 

• losses from fraudulent transactions as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws rules and regulations 

• increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party’s security breach and 

• reputational harm arising from the perception that jpmorgan chase’s systems may not be secure 

as jpmorgan chase’s interconnectivity with clients customers and other external parties continues to expand jpmorgan chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties security breaches affecting jpmorgan chase’s clients or customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties may require jpmorgan chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information including restricting the access of customers to their accounts these actions can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in jpmorgan chase 

furthermore the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions clearing banks ccps payment processors financial technology companies securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity including due to a cyber attack may cause industrywide operational disruptions that could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to conduct business 



jpmorgan chase’s operations rely on its ability and the ability of key external parties to maintain appropriatelystaffed workforces and on the competence trustworthiness health and safety of employees 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence integrity health and safety of its employees jpmorgan chase is similarly dependent on the workforces of other parties on which jpmorgan chase’s operations rely including vendors custodians and financial markets infrastructures jpmorgan chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by 

• the ineffective implementation of business decisions 

• any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls 

• staffing shortages particularly in tight labor markets 

• a significant operational breakdown or failure theft fraud or other unlawful conduct or 

• other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of jpmorgan chase or of another party on which jpmorgan chase’s operations depend 

jpmorgan chase’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its employees are ineffective or if any external party on which jpmorgan chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees 

jpmorgan chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws rules and regulations both within and outside the us governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals the protected parties can include 

• jpmorgan chase’s current prospective and former clients and customers 

• clients and customers of jpmorgan chase’s clients and customers 

• current prospective and former employees and 

• employees of jpmorgan chase’s vendors counterparties and other external parties 

ensuring that jpmorgan chase’s collection use sharing and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict can 

• increase jpmorgan chase’s compliance and operating costs 

• hinder the development of new products or services curtail the offering of existing products or services or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers 

• demand significant oversight by jpmorgan chase’s management and 

• require jpmorgan chase to structure its businesses operations and systems in less efficient ways 

not all of jpmorgan chase’s clients customers vendors counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and jpmorgan chase particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means jpmorgan chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients customers employees or others were to be mishandled or misused such as situations where such information is 

• erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information or 

• intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties 

concerns regarding the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s measures to safeguard personal information or even the perception that those measures are inadequate could cause jpmorgan chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers and thereby reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues furthermore any failure or perceived failure by jpmorgan chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices significant liabilities or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions any of these could damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses 

in recent years wellpublicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection use sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information by companies in the us and other countries that scrutiny has in some cases resulted in and could in the future lead to the adoption of stricter laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use sharing and storage of personal information these types of laws rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors and thereby increase compliance costs or could restrict jpmorgan chase’s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers these restrictions could also inhibit jpmorgan chase’s 



part i 

development or marketing of certain products or services or increase the costs of offering them to customers 

jpmorgan chase’s operations results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control 

jpmorgan chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted and its reputation could be harmed by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control including material instances of 

• cyber attacks 

• security breaches of its physical premises including threats to health and safety 

• power telecommunications or internet outages or shutdowns of mass transit 

• failure of or loss of access to technology or operational systems including any resulting loss of critical data 

• damage to or loss of property or assets of jpmorgan chase or third parties and any consequent injuries including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by jpmorgan chase 

• effects of climate change 

• natural disasters or severe weather conditions 

• accidents such as explosions or structural failures 

• health emergencies the spread of infectious diseases epidemics or pandemics or 

• events arising from local or largerscale civil unrest any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or terrorist acts 

jpmorgan chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business disruption including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to jpmorgan chase its clients and customers and third parties with which it does business or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events in addition jpmorgan chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed or conversely if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated further should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic the disruptive effects of those events on jpmorgan chase’s business and operations and on its clients customers 

counterparties and employees could become more significant and longlasting 

any significant failure or disruption of jpmorgan chase’s operations or operational systems or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control could 

• hinder jpmorgan chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties 

• require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event 

• cause it to incur losses or liabilities including from loss of revenue damage to or loss of property or injuries 

• disrupt market infrastructure systems on which jpmorgan chase’s businesses rely 

• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and 

• harm its reputation 

enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures 

jpmorgan chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries jpmorgan chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers jpmorgan chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase specifically any such failure could result in 

• potential harm to clients and customers and any liability associated with that harm 

• regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions 

• lower revenues and the opportunity cost from lost revenues 

• increased operational costs or 

• harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to jpmorgan chase 

any inadequacy or lapse in jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework governance structure practices models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected any such inadequacy or lapse could 



• hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to jpmorgan chase’s senior management and board of directors 

• lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase 

• require significant resources and time to remediate 

• lead to noncompliance with laws rules and regulations 

• attract heightened regulatory scrutiny 

• expose jpmorgan chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings 

• subject it to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions 

• lead to potential harm to customers and clients and any liability associated with that harm 

• harm its reputation or 

• otherwise diminish confidence in jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s data gathering analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices these deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting 

many of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on management’s subjective judgment or assumptions for example many models used by jpmorgan chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress including difficult or less liquid market environments or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated conversely previouslycorrelated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could in some circumstances limit the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies causing it to incur losses 

jpmorgan chase could recognize unexpected losses its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models estimations or judgments including those used in its financial statements prove to be inadequate or incorrect 

jpmorgan chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations to measure monitor and implement controls over its market credit capital liquidity operational and other risks jpmorgan chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” 

these models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary the models and estimations that jpmorgan chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors such as 

• reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices 

• inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes 

• historical trend information may be incomplete or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility dislocation or lack of liquidity 

• sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments 

• technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology 

• models and estimations may contain erroneous data valuations formulas or algorithms and 

• review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations 

jpmorgan chase may experience unexpected losses if models estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements prove to have been inadequate or incorrect for example where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value jpmorgan chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment 

similarly jpmorgan chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations these types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors as noted above in addition certain models used by jpmorgan chase as a basis for the determination of the allowance for expected credit losses experienced heightened performance risk in the economic environment during the early stages of the covid19 pandemic these models are based on historical experience of internallydeveloped macroeconomic scenarios and when the current and forecasted environment is significantly different from the scenarios 



part i 

underlying those models jpmorgan chase may need to apply a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that it has made or may make to model outputs 

some of the models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations used by jpmorgan chase in managing risks are subject to review by and require the approval of jpmorgan chase’s regulators these reviews are required before jpmorgan chase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk rwa credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under basel iii if jpmorgan chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators it may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses 

lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s profitability or reputation 

there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur any such lapses or deficiencies could result in inaccurate financial reporting which in turn could 

• materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition

strategic 

if jpmorgan chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies jpmorgan chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations these strategies relate to 

• the products and services that jpmorgan chase offers 

• the geographies in which it operates 

• the types of clients and customers that it serves 

• the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests 

• the counterparties with which it does business and 

• the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services 

if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients customers investors employees and other stakeholders then the franchise values and growth prospects of jpmorgan chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline 

jpmorgan chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities both in the near term and over longer time horizons management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources control expenses and return capital to shareholders each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to 

• devise effective business plans and strategies 

• offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers 

• allocate capital in a manner that promotes longterm stability to enable jpmorgan chase to build and invest in marketleading businesses even in a highly stressed environment 

• allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations 

• appropriately address concerns of clients customers investors employees and other stakeholders including with respect to social and sustainability matters 

• react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures or 

• develop and enhance the operational technology risk financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

furthermore jpmorgan chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of excess properties premises and facilities and those costs could be material to its results of operations in a given period 

jpmorgan chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of changes in financial regulation technological advances increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions jpmorgan chase expects that competition in the us and global financial services industry will continue to be intense competitors include 

• other banks and financial institutions 

• trading advisory and investment management firms 



• finance companies 

• technology companies and 

• other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services 

jpmorgan chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations 

new competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge for example technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products these advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading payments processing and online automated algorithmicbased investment advice furthermore both financial institutions and their nonbanking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services including deposits and other traditional banking products could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies such as cryptocurrencies and other applications that use secure distributed ledgers that require no intermediation new technologies have required and could require jpmorgan chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors including technology companies in addition new technologies may be used by customers or breached or infiltrated by third parties in unexpected ways which can increase jpmorgan chase’s costs for complying with laws rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that jpmorgan chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies 

ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for jpmorgan chase’s products and services or may cause jpmorgan chase to lose market share particularly with respect to traditional banking products this competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered transaction execution innovation reputation and price the failure of any of jpmorgan chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers whether due to general market conditions underperformance a decision not to offer a particular product or service changes in client and customer expectations or other factors could affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers any such impact could in turn reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues increased competition also may require jpmorgan chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive 

the effects of climate change could adversely impact jpmorgan chase and its clients 

jpmorgan chase operates in many regions countries and communities around the world where its businesses and the activities of its clients and customers could be impacted by climate change climate change could manifest as a financial risk to jpmorgan chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a lowcarbon economy including changes in climate policy or in the regulation of financial institutions with respect to risks posed by climate change 

climaterelated physical risks include acute weather events such as hurricanes and floods and chronic shifts in the climate such as altered distribution and intensity of rainfall prolonged droughts or flooding increased frequency of wildfires rising sea levels or a rising heat index climaterelated physical risks could have adverse financial and other impacts on jpmorgan chase both directly on its business and operations and as a result of impacts to its clients and customers including 

• declines in asset values including due to the destruction or degradation of property 

• reduced availability of insurance 

• significant interruptions to business operations including supply chain disruption and 

• systemic changes to geographies regional economies and sectors and any resulting population migration or unemployment 

transition risks arise from the process of adjusting to a lowcarbon economy in addition to possible changes in climate policy and financial regulation potential transition risks may include economic and other changes engendered by the development of lowcarbon technological advances eg electric vehicles and renewable energy andor changes in consumer preferences towards lowcarbon goods and services transition risks could be further accelerated by the occurrence of changes in the physical climate the possible adverse impacts of transition risks to both jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers include 

• sudden devaluation of assets including unanticipated writedowns “stranded assets” 

• increased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate policy andor regulations 

• negative consequences to business models and the need to make changes in response to those consequences and 

• damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation including as a result of any perception that its business practices are contrary to public policy or stakeholder preferences 

both physical risks and transition risks could have negative impacts on the revenues financial condition or creditworthiness of jpmorgan’s clients and customers and on its exposure to those clients and customers 



part i 

conduct 

conduct failure by jpmorgan chase employees can harm clients and customers impact market integrity damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action 

jpmorgan chase’s employees interact with clients customers and counterparties and with each other every day all employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of jpmorgan chase’s code of conduct and how we do business principles including jpmorgan chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way” jpmorgan chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle including recruiting onboarding training and development and performance management conduct risk management is also an integral component of jpmorgan chase’s promotion and compensation processes

jpmorgan chase’s reputation could be harmed and collateral consequences could result from a failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with jpmorgan chase’s expectations policies and practices including by acting in ways that harm clients customers other market participants or other employees some examples of this include 

• improperly selling and marketing jpmorgan chase’s products or services

• managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate jpmorgan chase’s risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives and 

• misappropriating property confidential or proprietary information or technology assets belonging to jpmorgan chase its clients and customers or third parties 

the consequences of any failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with jpmorgan chase’s expectations policies or practices could include litigation or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions or lead to 

• financial losses 

• increased operational and compliance costs 

• greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties 

• regulatory actions that require jpmorgan chase to restructure curtail or cease certain of its activities 

• the need for significant oversight by jpmorgan chase’s management 

• loss of clients or customers and 

• harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

the foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to newlyacquired businesses if jpmorgan chase fails to successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any of those employees do not conduct themselves in accordance with jpmorgan chases expectations policies and practices 

reputation 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could harm its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients customers investors and employees damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase’s business and prospects and can arise from numerous sources including 

• employee misconduct including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients customers or employees or actions that are contrary to jpmorgan chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace

• failure or perceived failure to comply with laws rules or regulations by jpmorgan chase or its clients customers counterparties or other parties including newlyacquired businesses companies in which jpmorgan chase has made principal investments parties to joint ventures with jpmorgan chase and vendors with which jpmorgan chase does business 

jpmorgan chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding jpmorgan chase whether or not true that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media nonmainstream news services or other parts of the internet this latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels 

social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment workers’ rights or communities activists have also engaged in public protests at jpmorgan chase’s headquarters and other properties activist criticism of jpmorgan chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients customers investors and employees with how jpmorgan chase addresses social and sustainability concerns in its business activities alternatively yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage jpmorgan chase’s relationships with clients and customers and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase does business whose views are not aligned with those of social and 

environmental activists in either case the resulting harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could 

• cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with jpmorgan chase 

• impair jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers 

• diminish jpmorgan chase’s ability to hire or retain employees 

• prompt jpmorgan chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers 

• cause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of jpmorgan chase or 

• attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies 

actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect jpmorgan chase’s reputation for example the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that 

• consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution or 

• a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers 

if jpmorgan chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers 

failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions as well as damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions obligations and interests with and among jpmorgan chase’s clients and customers jpmorgan chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions and its reputation can be damaged by the failure or perceived failure to 

• adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in or having one or more investments related to the same transaction 

• deliver appropriate standards of service and quality 

• treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care 

• use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations 



part i 

• provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards or 

• handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws rules and regulations 

a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

country 

an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on jpmorgan chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally 

aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into fullscale war with potentially catastrophic consequences particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons depending on the scope of the conflict the hostilities could result in 

• worldwide economic disruption 

• heightened volatility in financial markets 

• severe declines in asset values accompanied by widespread selloffs of investments 

• substantial depreciation of local currencies potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region 

• disruption of global trade and 

• diminished consumer business and investor confidence 

any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on jpmorgan chase’s operations and earnings both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally further if the us were to become directly involved in such a conflict this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that jpmorgan chase may have in the affected countries or region as well as in any nation that is aligned against the us in the hostilities jpmorgan chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict 

jpmorgan chase’s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic political regulatory and social factors 

some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political legal and 

regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which jpmorgan chase operates in addition in some jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase conducts business the local economy and business activity are subject to substantial government influence or control some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions including 

• extreme currency fluctuations 

• high inflation 

• low or negative growth and 

• defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt 

the governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment such as 

• price capital or exchange controls including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange 

• expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property including intellectual property and 

• changes in laws rules and regulations 

the impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller less liquid and more volatile than moredeveloped markets these types of government actions can negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s operations in the relevant country either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multinational clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction 

in addition emerging markets countries as well as certain more developed countries have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions including 

• widespread demonstrations civil unrest or general strikes 

• crime and corruption 

• security and personal safety issues 

• an outbreak or escalation of hostilities 

• overthrow of incumbent governments 

• terrorist attacks and 

• other forms of internal discord 

these economic political regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in and in the future could lead to conditions that can adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues growth and profitability of those operations in addition any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries including in the us 



people 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are its most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense jpmorgan chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain develop and motivate its existing employees jpmorgan chases efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors if jpmorgan chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees including successors to the chief executive officer members of the operating committee and other senior leaders jpmorgan chase’s performance including its competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 

unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations 

jpmorgan chase relies on the skills knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world changes in immigration or travel policies in the us and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in or travel to or transfer between jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce or could prompt jpmorgan chase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly 

legal 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties actions currently pending against jpmorgan chase may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions adverse to jpmorgan chase any of these matters could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that jpmorgan chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations 

regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams and jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations are subject to 

heightened regulatory oversight this heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of such an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions there is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against jpmorgan chase furthermore a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal state or local agencies and officials in the us or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in nonus jurisdictions 

if another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by jpmorgan chase 

these and other initiatives by us and nonus governmental authorities may subject jpmorgan chase to judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions and may require jpmorgan chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of these potential outcomes could harm jpmorgan chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs thereby reducing jpmorgan chase’s profitability or result in collateral consequences in addition the extent of jpmorgan chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could in some cases exceed the amount of reserves that jpmorgan chase has established for those matters

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease covid19 to be a global pandemic the covid19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led to the institution of social distancing and shelterinplace requirements in certain areas of the us and other countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global economic conditions including 

• significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets 

• significant disruption of global supply chains and 

• closures of many businesses leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment 

a prolongation or worsening of the pandemic or the emergence of other diseases that give rise to similar effects could deepen the adverse impact on the global economy 

the adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations including 

• reduction in demand for certain products and services from jpmorgan chase’s clients and customers resulting in lower revenue and 

• increases in the allowance for credit losses 

certain models used by jpmorgan chase in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and government stimulus there can be no assurance that even after adjustments have been made to model outputs jpmorgan chase will not recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from these developments 

a prolongation or worsening of the covid19 pandemic and the negative economic impacts of the pandemic could have other significant adverse effects on jpmorgan chase’s businesses results of operations and financial condition including

• the possibility that significant portions of jpmorgan chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines shelterinplace arrangements government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic negatively affects jpmorgan chase’s businesses results of operations and financial condition as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic the effectiveness of vaccination programs and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic those negative effects including the possible recognition of chargeoffs may be delayed

• negative publicity and 

• increased exposure to litigation 

any or all of which could increase jpmorgan chase’s operational legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation to the extent that the covid19 pandemic adversely affects jpmorgan chase’s business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below

• proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on certain financial services activities or 

• introduce changes to antitrust or anticompetition laws rules and regulations that adversely affect the business activities of jpmorgan chase 

differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for jpmorgan chase’s business 

the content and application of laws rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates and other criteria for example 

• larger firms such as jpmorgan chase are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation 

• financial technology companies and other nontraditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms or 

• the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction 

these differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as jpmorgan chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation especially with respect to unregulated financial products 

there can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the us and in other countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase that may be subject to those enhanced regulations 

legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the us could require jpmorgan chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant 



countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements these include laws rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to 

• the establishment of locallybased intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries 

• requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locallybased subsidiaries 

• the separation or “ring fencing” of core banking products and services from markets activities 

• the resolution of financial institutions 

• requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties “ccps” 

• position limits and reporting rules for derivatives 

• governance and accountability regimes 

• conduct of business and control requirements and 

• restrictions on compensation 

these types of differences in financial services regulation or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws rules and regulations between different jurisdictions have required and could in the future require jpmorgan chase to 

• divest assets or restructure its operations 

• absorb increased operational capital and liquidity costs 

• change the prices that it charges for its products and services 

• curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients or 

• incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks 

any or all of these factors could harm jpmorgan chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws rules and regulations or supervisory oversight or harm jpmorgan chase’s businesses results of operations and profitability 

heightened regulatory scrutiny of jpmorgan chase’s businesses could result in higher compliance costs and restrictions on its operations 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions jpmorgan chase has paid significant fines provided other monetary relief incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies jpmorgan chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in jpmorgan chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions 

in connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions certain regulators have required jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution these types of admissions can lead to 

• greater exposure in litigation 

• damage to reputation 

• disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers or in specific jurisdictions or 

• other direct and indirect adverse effects 

furthermore us government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution including 

• loss of clients customers and business 

• restrictions on offering certain products or services and 

• losing permission to operate certain businesses either temporarily or permanently 

jpmorgan chase expects that 

• it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions 

• regulators will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions and 

• regulators will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against jpmorgan chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions 

if jpmorgan chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators it could be required to 

• enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions 

• pay additional regulatory fines penalties or judgments or 

• accept material regulatory restrictions on or changes in the management of its businesses 



part i 

in these circumstances jpmorgan chase could also become subject to other sanctions or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action 

complying with economic sanctions and anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws rules and regulations can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks 

jpmorgan chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” and similar national and multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside the us as well as anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws rules and regulations throughout the world jpmorgan chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements certain governments have enacted laws which are commonly referred to as “blocking laws” that are designed to prohibit compliance with some us sanctions and may raise significant conflict of laws issues a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anticorruption or antimoney laundering laws rules and regulations or enforcement of blocking laws could subject jpmorgan chase and individual employees to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties 

jpmorgan chase’s operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks  

jpmorgan chase conducts business in certain countries in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable including with respect to 

• the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions 

• conflicting or ambiguous laws rules and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations 

• uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual intellectual property or other obligations 

• difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and 

• the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies 

if the application of the laws rules and regulations in a particular country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes this can create a more difficult environment in which jpmorgan chase conducts its business and could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s operations 

and reduce its earnings with respect to that country for example conducting business could require jpmorgan chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws rules and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures 

there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates and the risk of noncompliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems 

requirements for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase could result in jpmorgan chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its business 

jpmorgan chase is required under federal reserve and fdic rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support in the event of material financial distress or failure the agencies’ evaluation of jpmorgan chase’s resolution plan may change and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time any such determinations or modifications could result in jpmorgan chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities which could increase its funding or operational costs or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers 

if the federal reserve and the fdic were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by jpmorgan chase has deficiencies they could jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on jpmorgan chase’s growth activities or operations the agencies could also require that jpmorgan chase restructure reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and strategy 

holders of jpmorgan chase  co’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution 

federal reserve rules require that jpmorgan chase  co the “parent company” maintain minimum levels of unsecured external longterm debt and other lossabsorbing capacity with specific terms “eligible ltd” for purposes of recapitalizing jpmorgan chase’s operating subsidiaries if the parent company were to enter into a resolution either 

• in a bankruptcy proceeding under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code or 

• in a receivership administered by the fdic under title ii of the doddfrank act “title ii” 



if the parent company were to enter into a resolution holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company will absorb the losses of the parent company and its subsidiaries 

the preferred “single point of entry” strategy under jpmorgan chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the parent company would enter bankruptcy proceedings jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner as a result the parent company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the parent company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors including holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority as determined by statute and secured creditors of the parent company 

accordingly in a resolution of the parent company in bankruptcy holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of the parent company would realize value only to the extent available to the parent company as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank na and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the parent company have been fully repaid 

the fdic has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution such as the parent company under title ii however the fdic has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy 

if the parent company were to approach or enter into a resolution none of the parent company the federal reserve or the fdic is obligated to follow jpmorgan chase’s preferred resolution strategy and losses to holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company under whatever strategy is ultimately followed could be greater than they might have been under jpmorgan chase’s preferred strategy 

regulatory uncertainties associated with the uk’s departure from the eu could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s business results of operations and operating model 

the uk’s departure from the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” was completed on december 31 2020 the trade and cooperation agreement entered into between the uk and the eu in december 2020 included very limited provisions relating to the conduct of financial services activities between the uk and the eu accordingly unless or until the uk and the eu enter into further agreements relating to financial services the regulatory environment for financial services in the aftermath of brexit can be expected to 

• significantly limit the ability of ukbased financial services firms to conduct business in the eu and vice versa 

• prolong uncertainty concerning the levels of market access for trading venues which could result in a reduction or fragmentation of market liquidity and 

• prolong ongoing uncertainties concerning optimal business models for firms providing financial services especially given that any changes in the regulation of such services by the uk may not benefit from equivalence determinations by the eu 

as a result of these limitations and uncertainties jpmorgan chase 

• has made and is continuing to make appropriate changes to its legal entity structure and operations in the uk and the eu to address the regulatory environment 

• is now maintaining and expects that it will be required to sustain a more fragmented operating model across its uk and eu operating entities and 

• expects that due to considerations such as operating expenses liquidity leverage and capital this modified european operating framework will be more complex less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case 

in addition the covid19 pandemic and eu and uk government responses to the pandemic including travel restrictions and lockdowns have introduced delays and uncertainties into jpmorgan chase’s implementation of its plans for maintaining continuity of service for its clients 

any or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the financial services market across the uk and the eu as well as jpmorgan chase’s business operations and earnings in the uk the eu and globally 

political 

economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

the economic environment and market conditions in which jpmorgan chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the us and other countries certain monetary fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in us and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets including  

• monetary policies and actions taken by the federal reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities including any sustained largescale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions 

• fiscal policies including with respect to taxation 



part i 

• actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of the covid19 pandemic as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken 

• isolationist foreign policies 

• the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies or 

• political and social pressures with respect to governmental policies and actions 

these types of political developments and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments could 

• erode investor confidence in the us economy and financial markets which could potentially undermine the status of the us dollar as a safe haven currency 

• provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations 

• lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the us federal national mortgage association and the us federal home loan mortgage corporation together the “us gses” 

• increase concerns about whether the us government will be funded and its outstanding debt serviced at any particular time 

• result in periodic shutdowns of the us government or governments in other countries and 

• increase investor reliance on actions by the federal reserve or other central banks or investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole 

these factors could lead to 

• slower growth rates rising inflation or recession 

• greater market volatility 

• a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads 

• erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets 

• diminished investor and consumer confidence 

• lower investment growth 

• largescale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the us and other countries 

• reduced commercial activity among trading partners 

• the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country 

• the possible departure of a country from or the dissolution of a political or economic alliance or treaty 

• potential expropriation or nationalization of assets or 

• other market dislocations including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions 

any of these potential outcomes could cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses on its marketmaking positions or in its investment portfolio reduce its liquidity and capital levels hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers and weaken its results of operations and financial condition 

market 

economic and market events and conditions can materially affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and investment and marketmaking positions 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following 

• investor consumer and business sentiment 

• events that reduce confidence in the financial markets 

• inflation or deflation 

• high unemployment or conversely a tightening labor market 

• the availability and cost of capital liquidity and credit 

• levels and volatility of interest rates credit spreads and market prices for currencies equities and commodities and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility 

• the economic effects of outbreaks of hostilities terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities cyber attacks climate change natural disasters severe weather conditions health emergencies the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics and 

• the health of the us and global economies 

all of these are affected by global economic market and political events and conditions as well as regulatory restrictions 

in addition jpmorgan chase’s investment portfolio and marketmaking businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events including 

• severe declines in asset values 

• unexpected credit events 

• unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa 

• the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to marketmaking and investment portfolio positions or 

• other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a financial instrument 



if jpmorgan chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from marketmaking activities this could reduce jpmorgan chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by us and global economic conditions including 

• personal and household income distribution 

• unemployment or underemployment 

• prolonged periods of exceptionally low interest rates 

• housing prices 

• consumer and small business confidence levels 

• changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt and 

• the number of personal bankruptcies 

heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts in addition sustained low growth low or negative interest rates inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses 

adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce jpmorgan chase’s earnings these consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where economic restrictions and shutdowns have occurred related to the covid19 pandemic declining industrial or manufacturing activity that has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment or where high levels of consumer debt such as outstanding student loans could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations 

jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers including 

• policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance education immigration employment status and housing and 

• policies aimed at the economy more broadly such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income 

in addition governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could if enacted into law encourage certain of jpmorgan chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and 

thereby trigger defaults and chargeoffs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers 

unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses 

in jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that jpmorgan chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients and therefore the revenue that jpmorgan chase receives from those transactions these factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that jpmorgan chase manages such as loan syndications or securities underwritings furthermore if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur the profitability of jpmorgan chase’s capital markets businesses including its loan syndication securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities could be reduced to the extent that those businesses 

• earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions or 

• dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices 

an adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on clients of jpmorgan chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses jpmorgan chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in or are dependent on any sector of the economy that is under stress 

the fees that jpmorgan chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions for example higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that jpmorgan chase manages or holds under custody which in turn could affect jpmorgan chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody similarly adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from jpmorgan chase funds or accounts or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a jpmorgan chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance 



part i 

an economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale clients and thereby diminish jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations for example the businesses of certain of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients severe and sustained adverse economic conditions including higher unemployment caused by the covid19 pandemic and governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which in turn could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans these consequences could result in jpmorgan chase experiencing higher delinquencies defaults and writeoffs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio thereby reducing jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses 

changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of jpmorgan chase’s revenue and income streams related to the firm’s traditional banking and funding activities 

in general a low or negative interest rate environment may cause 

• net interest margins to be compressed which could reduce the amounts that jpmorgan chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higheryielding instruments 

• unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior which could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s broader asset and liability management strategy 

• jpmorgan chase to reduce the amount of deposits that it accepts from customers and clients which could result in lower revenues and 

• a reduction in the value of jpmorgan chase’s mortgage servicing rights “msrs” asset thereby decreasing revenues 

when credit spreads widen it becomes more expensive for jpmorgan chase to borrow jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to jpmorgan chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads will affect positively or negatively jpmorgan chase’s earnings on certain liabilities such as derivatives that are recorded at fair value 

when interest rates are increasing jpmorgan chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income however higher interest rates can also lead to 

• fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans 

• losses on underwriting exposures 

• the loss of deposits including in the event that jpmorgan chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior 

• lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of shortterm and longterm borrowings 

• less liquidity in the financial markets and 

• higher funding costs 

all of these outcomes could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within jpmorgan chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates if borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments thereby causing jpmorgan chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans 

jpmorgan chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments 

the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations market volatility illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods in light of factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments in addition at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments the price that jpmorgan chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of jpmorgan chase’s financial instruments which may have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management and monitoring processes including its stress testing framework seek to quantify and control jpmorgan chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves however jpmorgan chase’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective and it could incur significant losses if extreme market events were to occur 



credit 

jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients counterparties custodians and ccps 

jpmorgan chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations financial institutions asset managers hedge funds exchanges and government entities within and outside the us many of these transactions expose jpmorgan chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties and can involve jpmorgan chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults jpmorgan chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations including under the eu alternative investment fund managers directive 

a default by or the financial or operational failure of a ccp through which jpmorgan chase executes contracts would require jpmorgan chase to replace those contracts thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses jpmorgan chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a ccp in which jpmorgan chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the ccp because of requirements that each member of the ccp absorb a portion of those losses as part of its clearing services activities jpmorgan chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral jpmorgan chase is also exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management clearing custodial and other transaction services to those clients if a client for which jpmorgan chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent jpmorgan chase may incur losses become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more ccps the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or be subject to regulatory investigations all of the foregoing events can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and litigation costs and jpmorgan chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses jpmorgan chase can also be subject to bearing its share of nondefault losses incurred by a ccp including losses from custodial settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches 

transactions with government entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities can expose jpmorgan chase to enhanced sovereign credit operational and reputation risks government entities may among other things claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government these types of actions have in the past caused and could in the future cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction 

in addition local laws rules and regulations could limit jpmorgan chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreedupon payments which could subject jpmorgan chase to losses 

disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral the disposition of those disputes could cause jpmorgan chase to incur unexpected transaction operational and legal costs or result in credit losses these consequences can also impair jpmorgan chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities or cause harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

the financial or operational failure of a significant market participant such as a major financial institution or a ccp or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant can have a cascading effect within the financial markets jpmorgan chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting and jpmorgan chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with and credit exposure to such a significant market participant 

jpmorgan chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity jpmorgan chase’s credit risk may be further increased when 

• jpmorgan chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral it holds 

• collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it or 

• counterparties are unable to post collateral whether for operational or other reasons 

furthermore disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and jpmorgan chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral 

jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk 

jpmorgan chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties 

• engage in similar or related businesses or in businesses in related industries 

• do business in the same geographic region or 

• have business profiles models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions 



part i 

for example a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar related or dependent industries this type of interrelationship could exacerbate jpmorgan chase’s credit liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses including fair value losses in its marketmaking businesses and investment portfolios in addition jpmorgan chase may be required to recognize higher allowances for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators 

similarly challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries wherever located these conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or nonbank competitors heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industrywide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to lesscreditworthy borrowers if large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans whether due to weak credit profiles an economic downturn or other factors this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to jpmorgan chase and result in higher chargeoffs and other creditrelated losses more broadly widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the us economy and jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment 

if jpmorgan chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of rwa that jpmorgan chase holds on its balance sheet these factors could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s capital position funding costs and the profitability of its businesses 

liquidity 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as 

• marketwide illiquidity or disruption 

• unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements including as a result of changes in laws rules and regulations 

• inability to sell assets or to sell assets at favorable times or prices 

• default by a ccp or other significant market participant 

• unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral 

• unexpected loss of consumer deposits and 

• lack of market or customer confidence in jpmorgan chase or financial institutions in general 

a reduction in jpmorgan chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control for example during periods of market stress low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for jpmorgan chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity 

jpmorgan chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lowercost sources of funding such as deposits and borrowings from federal home loan banks is reduced alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability jpmorgan chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that jpmorgan chase may take in order to 

• satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements 

• address obligations under its resolution plan or 

• satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the us relating to the prepositioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities 

more generally if jpmorgan chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries including in particular its brokerdealer subsidiaries and thereby adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company that holds the stock of jpmorgan chase bank na and an intermediate holding company jpmorgan chase holdings llc the “ihc” the ihc in turn holds the stock of substantially all of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries other than jpmorgan chase bank na and its subsidiaries the ihc also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding company 

the holding company is obligated to contribute to the ihc substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock 

the ability of jpmorgan chase bank na and the ihc to make payments to the holding company is also limited jpmorgan chase bank na is subject to restrictions 



on its dividend distributions as well as capital adequacy requirements such as the supplementary leverage ratio “slr” and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company the ihc is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by jpmorgan chase’s management or board of directors 

as a result of these arrangements the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from jpmorgan chase bank na and dividends and extensions of credit from the ihc these limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to 

• pay interest on its debt securities 

• pay dividends on its equity securities 

• redeem or repurchase outstanding securities and 

• fulfill its other payment obligations 

these regulatory restrictions and limitations could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the ihc is subject 

reductions in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies rating agencies evaluate both general and firmspecific and industryspecific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution including 

• expected future profitability 

• risk management practices 

• legal expenses 

• ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and nonbank subsidiaries 

• regulatory developments 

• assumptions about government support and 

• economic and geopolitical trends 

jpmorgan chase closely monitors and manages to the extent that it is able factors that could influence its credit ratings however there is no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future furthermore any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when jpmorgan chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

a reduction in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings could curtail jpmorgan chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways including 

• reducing its access to capital markets 

• materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities 

• triggering additional collateral or funding requirements and 

• decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to jpmorgan chase 

any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries this could in turn adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries 

the reform and replacement of benchmark rates could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s funding investments and financial products and expose it to litigation and other disputes 

interest rate equity foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” including those in widespread and longstanding use have been the subject of ongoing international national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives and proposals for reform some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration these reforms may cause certain benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated 

any of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks 

any of these developments and any future initiatives to regulate reform or change the administration of benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on value of and market for loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark including those issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase 

various regulators industry bodies and other market participants in the us and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks there is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmarks that they seek to replace if a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark this could result in widespread 



part i 

dislocation in the financial markets engender volatility in the pricing of securities derivatives and other instruments and suppress capital markets activities all of which could have adverse effects on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations 

to the extent that any guidance provided by accounting standard setters concerning the transition from benchmark rates is not comprehensive fails to provide the expected relief or the ability to elect or implement that guidance is constrained in any significant respect the transition could 

• affect hedge accounting relationships between financial instruments linked to a particular benchmark and any related derivatives which could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s results of operations or 

• increase jpmorgan chase’s operational costs with respect to the determination of whether the transition has resulted in the modification or extinguishment of specific contracts for accounting purposes 

ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor has announced that it will consult on its intention to 

• cease publication of i all tenors of the euro sterling swiss franc and yen libors and ii the one week and two month tenors of us dollar libor in each case after december 31 2021 and 

• cease publication of all remaining tenors of us dollar libor after june 30 2023 

these announcements indicate that it is highly likely that various tenors of the libor benchmark will be discontinued on or about the timeframes mentioned above vast amounts of loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the libor benchmark and any inability of market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace libor and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of libor could result in disruption in the financial markets and suppress capital markets activities all of which could have a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations and on liborlinked securities credit or other instruments which are issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients customers counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from libor and other benchmark rates to replacement rates including claims that jpmorgan chase has 

• treated clients customers counterparties or investors unfairly or caused them to experience losses higher financing costs or lower returns on investments 

• failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that jpmorgan chase has sold to its clients and customers or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest 

• made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose in connection with the transition from benchmark rates 

• engaged in anticompetitive behavior or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates or 

• disadvantaged clients customers counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments 

these types of claims could subject jpmorgan chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes and harm its reputation 

capital 

maintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact jpmorgan chase’s ability to support business activities meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders 

jpmorgan chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements including leverage and riskbased capital requirements that can change due to actions by banking regulators jpmorgan chase’s adherence to these requirements can also evolve dynamically in response to changes in the composition of its balance sheet or other factors it is possible that these changing requirements including meeting or exceeding various capital ratio thresholds could limit jpmorgan chase’s ability to support its businesses and make capital distributions to its shareholders 

actions by the federal reserve and the us government in response to the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic have led to an expansion of the federal reserves balance sheet growth in deposit balances held by jpmorgan chase and other us financial institutions and consequently an increase in jpmorgan chases leverage exposure if these trends were to continue jpmorgan chase may be required to hold more capital or take other actions in order to satisfy the leveragebased capital requirements applicable to it 

jpmorgan chase is required to submit at least annually a capital plan describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders redemptions and repurchases of its outstanding securities and other capital actions that it intends to take jpmorgan chase considers various factors in managing capital including the impact of stress on its capital levels as determined by both internal modeling and the federal reserve’s modeling of jpmorgan chase’s capital position in supervisory stress tests because the federal reserve and jpmorgan chase use different forecasting models and methodologies when determining stress test results there can be significant differences between the estimates of stress loss as determined by the federal reserve and jpmorgan chase respectively the federal 



reserve may require modifications to jpmorgan chase’s capital plan and may change the stress capital buffer “scb” applicable to jpmorgan chase from time to time 

any failure by or inability of jpmorgan chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital or unfavorable changes in the capital requirements imposed by banking regulators could have an adverse impact on jpmorgan chase’s shareholders such as 

• reducing the amount of common stock that jpmorgan chase is permitted to repurchase 

• requiring the issuance of or prohibiting the redemption of capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with jpmorgan chase’s capital management strategy 

• constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock or 

• curtailing jpmorgan chase’s business activities or operations 

operational 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses rely on the ability of jpmorgan chase’s financial accounting transaction execution data processing and other operational systems to process record monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis and to do so accurately quickly and securely in addition to proper design installation maintenance and training the effective functioning of jpmorgan chase’s operational systems depends on 

• the quality of the information contained in those systems as inaccurate outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information and 

• jpmorgan chase’s ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements 

jpmorgan chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors custodians and other market participants including clearing and payment systems ccps securities exchanges and data processing security and technology companies 

the ineffectiveness failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which jpmorgan chase depends including due to a systems malfunction cyberbreach or other systems failure could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including 

• delays or other disruptions in providing information services and liquidity to clients and customers 

• the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required 

• failure to timely settle or confirm transactions 

• the possibility that funds transfers capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended consequences 

• financial losses including due to losssharing requirements of ccps payment systems or other market infrastructures or as possible restitution to clients and customers 

• higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable 

• client or customer dissatisfaction with jpmorgan chase’s products and services 

• regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions against jpmorgan chase 

• loss of confidence in the ability of jpmorgan chase or financial institutions generally to protect against and withstand operational disruptions or 

• harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

as the speed frequency volume interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase it can become more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade jpmorgan chase’s operational systems and infrastructure especially due to the heightened risks that 

• attempts by third parties to defraud jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers may increase evolve or become more complex particularly during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty 

• errors made by jpmorgan chase or another market participant whether inadvertent or malicious cause widespread system disruption 

• isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound or migrate to other systems over time to become larger issues 

• failures in synchronization or encryption software or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws could cause disruptions in operational systems or the inability of systems to communicate with each other and 

• third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights 

if jpmorgan chase’s operational systems or those of external parties on which jpmorgan chase’s businesses depend are unable to meet the requirements of jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations or bank regulatory

standards or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings jpmorgan chase could be materially and adversely affected 

a successful cyber attack affecting jpmorgan chase could cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers 

jpmorgan chase experiences numerous attempted cyber attacks on its computer systems software networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries cybercriminals “hacktivists” ie individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change and others these cyber attacks can take many forms including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code which is commonly referred to as “malware” into jpmorgan chase’s systems these attacks are typically designed to 

• obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to jpmorgan chase or its clients customers counterparties or employees 

• manipulate data 

• destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable 

• disrupt sabotage or degrade service on jpmorgan chase’s systems 

• steal money or 

• extort money through the use of socalled “ransomware” 

jpmorgan chase has also experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services 

jpmorgan chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers 

a principal reason that jpmorgan chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate detect or recognize threats to jpmorgan chase’s systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches this is because 

• the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and are increasingly sophisticated and therefore may not be recognized until launched 

• cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including jpmorgan chase’s own employees cybercriminals hacktivists groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally 

• jpmorgan chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of 

clients customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which it does business and 

• it is possible that a third party after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected might obtain access to other networks and systems 

the risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future as jpmorgan chase continues to expand its mobile banking and other internetbased product offerings and its internal use of internetbased products and applications furthermore increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions during the covid19 pandemic to facilitate workfromhome arrangements for employees could increase jpmorgan chase’s exposure to cyber attacks in addition a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by jpmorgan chase’s employees 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences including 

• significant disruption of jpmorgan chase’s operations and those of its clients customers and counterparties including losing access to operational systems 

• misappropriation of confidential information of jpmorgan chase or that of its clients customers counterparties employees or regulators 

• disruption of or damage to jpmorgan chase’s systems and those of its clients customers and counterparties 

• the inability or extended delays in the ability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen manipulated or destroyed or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions 

• violations by jpmorgan chase of applicable privacy and other laws 

• financial loss to jpmorgan chase or to its clients customers counterparties or employees 

• loss of confidence in jpmorgan chase’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures 

• dissatisfaction among jpmorgan chase’s clients customers or counterparties 

• significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and 

• harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that jpmorgan chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed while such an investigation is ongoing jpmorgan chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack and that damage may 



continue to spread these factors may inhibit jpmorgan chase’s ability to provide rapid full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients customers counterparties and regulators as well as the public furthermore it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products services and delivery platforms 

when jpmorgan chase launches a new product or service introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services including mobile connectivity electronic trading and cloud computing or makes changes to an existing product service or delivery platform it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes any significant failure in this regard could diminish jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in 

• potential liability to clients counterparties and customers 

• increased operating expenses 

• higher litigation costs including regulatory fines penalties and other sanctions 

• damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

• impairment of jpmorgan chase’s liquidity 

• regulatory intervention or 

• weaker competitive standing 

any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system 

external operational systems with which jpmorgan is connected whether directly or indirectly can be sources of operational risk to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which jpmorgan chase is directly connected but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected similarly retailers data aggregators and other external parties with which jpmorgan chase’s customers do business can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational risk this is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are 

beyond jpmorgan chase’s security and control systems including through the use of the internet cloud computing services and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services 

if an external party obtains access to customer account data on jpmorgan chase’s systems and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including 

• heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using jpmorgan chase’s systems 

• losses from fraudulent transactions as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws rules and regulations 

• increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party’s security breach and 

• harm to reputation arising from the perception that jpmorgan chase’s systems may not be secure 

as jpmorgan chase’s interconnectivity with clients customers and other external parties continues to expand jpmorgan chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties security breaches affecting jpmorgan chase’s clients or customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties may require jpmorgan chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information including restricting the access of customers to their accounts these actions can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in jpmorgan chase 

furthermore the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions central agents ccps payment processors securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that an operational failure or cyber attack involving one institution or entity may cause industrywide operational disruptions that could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to conduct business 

jpmorgan chase’s operations could be impaired if its employees or those of external parties are not competent and trustworthy or if measures to protect their health and safety are ineffective 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on the competence and integrity of its employees as well as employees of other parties on which jpmorgan chase’s operations rely including vendors custodians and financial markets infrastructures jpmorgan

chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by 

• the ineffective implementation of business decisions 

• any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls 

• a significant operational breakdown or failure theft fraud or other unlawful conduct or 

• other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of jpmorgan chase or of another party on which jpmorgan chase’s operations depend 

jpmorgan chase’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its employees are ineffective or if any external party on which jpmorgan chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees 

jpmorgan chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws rules and regulations both within and outside the us governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals the protected parties can include 

• jpmorgan chase’s clients and customers and prospective clients and customers 

• clients and customers of jpmorgan chase’s clients and customers 

• employees and prospective employees and 

• employees of jpmorgan chase’s vendors counterparties and other external parties 

ensuring that jpmorgan chase’s collection use transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict can 

• increase jpmorgan chase’s compliance and operating costs 

• hinder the development of new products or services curtail the offering of existing products or services or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers 

• demand significant oversight by jpmorgan chase’s management and 

• require jpmorgan chase to structure its businesses operations and systems in less efficient ways 

not all of jpmorgan chase’s clients customers vendors counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality 

of the information exchanged between them and jpmorgan chase particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means jpmorgan chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions if personal confidential or proprietary information of clients customers employees or others were to be mishandled or misused such as situations where such information is 

• erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information or 

• intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties 

concerns regarding the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s measures to safeguard personal information or even the perception that those measures are inadequate could cause jpmorgan chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers and thereby reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues furthermore any failure or perceived failure by jpmorgan chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices significant liabilities or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions any of these could damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses 

in recent years wellpublicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the us and other countries that scrutiny has in some cases resulted in and could in the future lead to the adoption of stricter laws rules and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information these types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors and thereby increase compliance costs or could restrict jpmorgan chase’s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers these restrictions could also inhibit jpmorgan chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services or increase the costs of offering them to customers 

jpmorgan chase’s operations results and reputation could be harmed by catastrophes or other events 

jpmorgan chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted and its reputation could be harmed by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control including 

• cyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises including data centers 

• power telecommunications or internet outages 

• failures of or loss of access to operational systems including computer systems servers networks and other technology assets 



• damage to or loss of property or assets of jpmorgan chase or third parties and any consequent injuries including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by jpmorgan chase 

• effects of climate change 

• natural disasters or severe weather conditions 

• accidents such as explosions or structural failures 

• health emergencies the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics or 

• events arising from local or largerscale political events including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts 

jpmorgan chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple catastrophes or other business interruption events in addition jpmorgan chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business interruption could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed or conversely if a catastrophic event occurs in an area in which a critical segment of jpmorgan chase’s workforce physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure is concentrated further should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions or health emergencies the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics become more chronic the disruptive effects of those events on jpmorgan chase’s business and operations and on its clients customers counterparties and employees could become more significant and longlasting 

any significant failure or disruption of jpmorgan chase’s operations or operational systems or any catastrophic event could 

• hinder jpmorgan chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties 

• require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption 

• cause it to incur losses or liabilities including from loss of revenue damage to or loss of property or injuries 

• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and 

• harm its reputation 

furthermore jpmorgan chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of certain excess properties 

premises and facilities and those costs may be material to its results of operations in a given period 

enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures 

jpmorgan chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries jpmorgan chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers jpmorgan chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase specifically any such failure could result in 

• potential liability to clients and customers 

• regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions 

• lower revenues and the opportunity cost from lost revenues 

• increased operational costs or 

• harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to jpmorgan chase 

any inadequacy or lapse in jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework governance structure practices models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected any such inadequacy or lapse could 

• hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to jpmorgan chase’s senior management and the board of directors 

• lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase 

• require significant resources and time to remediate 

• lead to noncompliance with laws rules and regulations 

• attract heightened regulatory scrutiny 

• expose jpmorgan chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings 

• subject it to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions 

• harm its reputation or 

• otherwise diminish confidence in jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of 



part i 

jpmorgan chase’s data gathering analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices these deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting 

many of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior these strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by jpmorgan chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress including difficult or less liquid market environments or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated conversely previouslycorrelated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could in some circumstances limit the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies causing it to incur losses 

jpmorgan chase could recognize unexpected losses its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models estimations or judgments including those used in its financial statements prove to be inadequate or incorrect 

jpmorgan chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations to measure monitor and implement controls over its market credit capital liquidity operational and other risks these models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary the models and estimations that jpmorgan chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors such as 

• reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices 

• inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes 

• historical trend information may be incomplete or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility dislocation or lack of liquidity 

• technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology 

• models and estimations may contain erroneous data valuations formulas or algorithms and 

• review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations 

some of the models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations used by jpmorgan chase in managing 

risks are subject to review by and require the approval of jpmorgan chase’s regulators these reviews are required before jpmorgan chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk rwa credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under basel iii if jpmorgan chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators it may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses jpmorgan chase also uses internal models in connection with its stress testing jpmorgan chase’s capital actions may require regulatory approval and could be constrained if its banking regulators object to a capital plan or require the resubmission of a capital plan due to the perceived inadequacy of jpmorgan chase’s models estimations or other factors 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” jpmorgan chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements including in determining the allowance for credit losses reserves related to litigation and the credit card rewards liability certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare jpmorgan chase’s financial statements including 

• trading assets and liabilities 

• instruments in the investment portfolio 

• certain loans 

• msrs 

• structured notes and 

• certain repurchase and resale agreements 

where quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments jpmorgan chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment and these types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors as noted above in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted if estimates or judgments underlying jpmorgan chase’s financial statements prove to have been incorrect jpmorgan chase may experience material losses 

jpmorgan chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures it then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the amounts of capital and liquidity that would be needed in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to jpmorgan chase’s results of operations and financial condition they require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations it is possible that 



jpmorgan chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

certain models used by jpmorgan chase in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and government stimulus for example at times certain macroeconomic variables employed in these models remained well outside the range of historical data used to train the models for some stress scenarios in addition the historical relationships between these macroeconomic variables and consumer and wholesale credit losses have deteriorated in part due to the effects of the cares act and government stimulus actions as a result there continues to be significant uncertainty about the reliability of the projections produced by the models to compensate for this uncertainty jpmorgan chase has made and may continue to make significant adjustments to the quantitative results of model calculations to take into consideration model imprecision emerging risks trends and other factors that are not yet reflected in those calculations there can be no assurance that even after adjustments have been made to model outputs jpmorgan chase will not recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from these developments 

lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s profitability or reputation 

there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur any such lapses or deficiencies could 

• materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition 

• restrict its ability to access the capital markets 

• require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies 

• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions 

• harm its reputation or 

• otherwise diminish investor confidence in jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies 

the preparation of jpmorgan chase’s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission as well as more detailed accounting policies established by jpmorgan chase’s management from time to time these accounting standards or 

accounting policies may change and in some cases these changes could have a significant effect on jpmorgan chase’s financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results 

as of january 1 2020 jpmorgan chase implemented a new accounting standard commonly referred to as the current expected credit losses “cecl” framework which requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments the allowance for credit losses related to certain of jpmorgan chase’s loans and other lendingrelated commitments portfolios increased upon implementation of cecl which has had a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s capital levels 

the ongoing impact of the adoption of cecl could include the following each of which could result in diminished investor confidence 

• greater volatility in jpmorgan chase’s earnings and capital levels over economic cycles 

• potential reductions in its capital distributions or 

• increases in the allowance for credit losses 

in addition jpmorgan chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products particularly during periods of economic stress as well as changes related to nonus financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this accounting standard

if jpmorgan chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies jpmorgan chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations these strategies relate to 

• the products and services that jpmorgan chase offers 

• the geographies in which it operates 

• the types of clients and customers that it serves 

• the counterparties with which it does business and 

• the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services 

if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients customers investors employees and other stakeholders then the franchise values and growth prospects of jpmorgan chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline 

jpmorgan chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective 



part i 

business plans to address these strategic priorities both in the near term and over longer time horizons management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources control expenses and return capital to shareholders each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to 

• devise effective business plans and strategies 

• offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers 

• allocate capital in a manner that promotes longterm stability to enable jpmorgan chase to build and invest in marketleading businesses even in a highly stressed environment 

• allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations 

• appropriately address concerns of clients customers investors employees and other stakeholders including with respect to social and sustainability matters 

• react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures or 

• develop and enhance the operational technology risk financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

jpmorgan chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of changes in financial regulation technological advances increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions jpmorgan chase expects that competition in the us and global financial services industry will continue to be intense competitors include 

• other banks and financial institutions 

• trading advisory and investment management firms 

• finance companies 

• technology companies and 

• other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services 

jpmorgan chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations 

new competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge for example technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products these advances have 

also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading payments processing and online automated algorithmicbased investment advice furthermore both financial institutions and their nonbanking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies such as cryptocurrencies that require no intermediation new technologies have required and could require jpmorgan chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors including technology companies in addition new technologies may be used by customers or breached or infiltrated by third parties in unexpected ways which can increase jpmorgan chase’s costs for complying with laws rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that jpmorgan chase earns from providing products and services through those new technologies 

ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for jpmorgan chase’s products and services or may cause jpmorgan chase to lose market share particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts this competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered transaction execution innovation reputation and price the failure of any of jpmorgan chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers whether due to general market conditions underperformance a decision not to offer a particular product or service changes in client and customer expectations or other factors could affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers any such impact could in turn reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues increased competition also may require jpmorgan chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive 

climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could have a material adverse impact on jpmorgan chase’s business operations clients and customers 

jpmorgan chase operates in many regions countries and communities around the world where its businesses and the activities of its clients and customers could be impacted by climate change climate change could manifest as a financial risk to jpmorgan chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a lowcarbon economy including changes in climate policy or in the regulation of financial institutions with respect to risks posed by climate change 

climaterelated physical risks include both acute weather events and chronic shifts in the climate potential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall prolonged droughts or flooding increased frequency of wildfires rising sea levels or a rising heat index 



transition risks arise from the process of adjusting to a lowcarbon economy in addition to possible changes in climate policy and financial regulation potential transition risks may include economic and other changes engendered by the development of lowcarbon technological advances eg electric vehicles and renewable energy andor changes in consumer preferences towards lowcarbon goods and services transition risks could be further accelerated by the occurrence of changes in the physical climate 

these climaterelated physical risks and transition risks could have a financial impact on jpmorgan chase both directly on its business and operations and as a result of material adverse impacts to its clients and customers including 

• declines in asset values 

• reduced availability of insurance 

• significant interruptions to business operations and 

• negative consequences to business models and the need to make changes in response to those consequences 

conduct 

conduct failure by jpmorgan chase employees can harm clients and customers impact market integrity damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action 

jpmorgan chase’s employees interact with clients customers and counterparties and with each other every day all employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of jpmorgan chase’s how we do business principles including jpmorgan chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way” jpmorgan chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle including recruiting onboarding training and development and performance management conduct risk management is also an integral component of jpmorgan chase’s promotion and compensation processes 

notwithstanding these expectations policies and practices certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct and these instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation as well as resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders deferred prosecution agreements nonprosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions there is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions and associated consequences or that any such actions will always be detected deterred or prevented 

jpmorgan chase’s reputation could be harmed and collateral consequences could result from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with jpmorgan chase’s expectations policies and practices including by acting in ways that harm clients customers other market 

participants or other employees some examples of this include 

• improperly selling and marketing jpmorgan chase’s products or services 

• engaging in insider trading market manipulation or unauthorized trading 

• engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs 

• facilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a particular tax accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities or where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the transaction 

• failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers 

• violating antitrust or anticompetition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets prices or indices

• managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate jpmorgan chase’s risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives and 

• misappropriating property confidential or proprietary information or technology assets belonging to jpmorgan chase its clients and customers or third parties 

the consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with jpmorgan chase’s expectations policies or practices could include litigation or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions or lead to 

• financial losses 

• increased operational and compliance costs 

• greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties 

• regulatory actions that require jpmorgan chase to restructure curtail or cease certain of its activities 

• the need for significant oversight by jpmorgan chase’s management 

• loss of clients or customers and 

• harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 



part i 

reputation 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could harm its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients customers investors and employees damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase’s business and prospects and can arise from numerous sources including 

• employee misconduct including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients customers or employees or actions that are contrary to jpmorgan chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace 

• security breaches including as a result of cyber attacks 

• failure to safeguard client customer or employee information 

• failure to manage risk issues associated with its business activities or those of its clients including failure to fully discharge publiclyannounced commitments to support social and sustainability initiatives 

• compliance or operational failures 

• litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions 

• regulatory investigations or enforcement actions or resolutions of these matters and 

• failure or perceived failure of clients customers counterparties or other parties to comply with laws rules or regulations including companies in which jpmorgan chase has made principal investments parties to joint ventures with jpmorgan chase and vendors with which jpmorgan chase does business 

jpmorgan chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding jpmorgan chase whether or not true that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media nonmainstream news services or other parts of the internet this latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels 

social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment workers’ rights or communities activists have also engaged in public protests at jpmorgan chase’s headquarters and other properties activist criticism of jpmorgan chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among 

clients customers investors and employees with how jpmorgan chase addresses social and sustainability concerns in its business activities alternatively yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage jpmorgan chase’s relationships with clients and customers and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase does business whose views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists in either case the resulting harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could 

• cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with jpmorgan chase 

• impair jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers 

• diminish jpmorgan chase’s ability to hire or retain employees 

• prompt jpmorgan chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers 

• cause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of jpmorgan chase or 

• attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies 

actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect jpmorgan chase’s reputation for example the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that 

• consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution 

• a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers 

if jpmorgan chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers 

failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions as well as damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions obligations and interests with and among jpmorgan chase’s clients and customers jpmorgan chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions and its reputation can be damaged by the failure or perceived failure to 

• adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in or having one or more investments related to the same transaction 

• deliver appropriate standards of service and quality 



• treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care 

• use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations 

• provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards or 

• handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws rules and regulations 

a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

country 

an outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on jpmorgan chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally 

aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into fullscale war with potentially catastrophic consequences particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons depending on the scope of the conflict the hostilities could result in 

• worldwide economic disruption 

• heightened volatility in financial markets 

• severe declines in asset values accompanied by widespread selloffs of investments 

• substantial depreciation of local currencies potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region 

• disruption of global trade and 

• diminished consumer business and investor confidence 

any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on jpmorgan chase’s operations and earnings both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally further if the us were to become directly involved in such a conflict this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that jpmorgan chase may have in the affected countries or region as well as in any nation that is aligned against the us in the hostilities jpmorgan chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict 

jpmorgan chase’s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic political regulatory and social factors 

some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which jpmorgan chase operates in addition in some jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase conducts business the local economy and business activity are subject to substantial government influence or control some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions including 

• extreme currency fluctuations 

• high inflation 

• low or negative growth and 

• defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt 

the governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment including 

• price capital or exchange controls including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange 

• expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property including intellectual property and 

• changes in laws rules and regulations 

the impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller less liquid and more volatile than moredeveloped markets these types of government actions can negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s operations in the relevant country either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multinational clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction 

in addition emerging markets countries as well as certain more developed countries have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions including 

• widespread demonstrations or civil unrest 

• general strikes and demonstrations 

• crime and corruption 

• security and personal safety issues 

• outbreaks of hostilities 

• overthrow of incumbent governments 

• terrorist attacks and 

• other forms of internal discord 

these economic political regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in and in the future 



part i 

could lead to conditions that can adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues growth and profitability of those operations in addition any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries including in the us 

people 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are its most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense jpmorgan chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain develop and motivate its existing employees if jpmorgan chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees including successors to the chief executive officer or members of the operating committee jpmorgan chase’s performance including its competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 

unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations 

jpmorgan chase relies on the skills knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world changes in immigration or travel policies in the us and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in or travel to or transfer between jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce or could prompt jpmorgan chase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly 

legal 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties actions currently pending against jpmorgan chase may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions adverse to jpmorgan chase any of these matters could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that jpmorgan chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations 

regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams and jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight this heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of such an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions there is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against jpmorgan chase furthermore a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal state or local agencies and officials in the us or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in nonus jurisdictions 

if another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by jpmorgan chase 

these and other initiatives by us and nonus governmental authorities may subject jpmorgan chase to judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions and may require jpmorgan chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of these potential outcomes could harm jpmorgan chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs thereby reducing jpmorgan chase’s profitability or result in collateral consequences in addition the extent of jpmorgan chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could in some cases exceed the amount of reserves that jpmorgan chase has established for those matters

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chase’s financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself or combined with other factors materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business results of operations financial condition capital position liquidity competitive position or reputation including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings 

regulatory 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are highly regulated and the laws and regulations that apply to jpmorgan chase have a significant impact on its business and operations 

jpmorgan chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide jpmorgan chase must comply with the laws rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business regulation of financial services is extensive 

jpmorgan chase has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry both within and outside the us the supervision of financial services firms also expanded 

 

significantly the increased regulation and supervision of jpmorgan chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require jpmorgan chase to make further changes to its business and operations these changes could result in jpmorgan chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations and could reduce its profitability for example existing and new laws and regulations have in the past and could in the future require jpmorgan chase to 

 differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for jpmorgan chase’s business 

the content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates and other criteria for example 

 these differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as jpmorgan chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation especially with respect to unregulated financial products 

there can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the us and in other countries 



and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory initiative or standard a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase that may be subject to those enhanced regulations 

legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the us could require jpmorgan chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements these include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to 

 these types of differences in financial services regulation or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions could require jpmorgan chase to 

 any or all of these factors could harm jpmorgan chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight or harm jpmorgan chase’s businesses results of operations and profitability 

 

heightened regulatory scrutiny of jpmorgan chase’s businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where jpmorgan chase does business jpmorgan chase has paid significant fines provided other monetary relief incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies jpmorgan chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in jpmorgan chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions 

in connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions certain regulators have required jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution these types of admissions can lead to 

 furthermore us government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution including 

 jpmorgan chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions jpmorgan chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions furthermore if jpmorgan chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action or to maintain risk and control processes that meet 



part i 

the heightened standards established by its regulators it could be required to 

 in these circumstances jpmorgan chase could also become subject to other sanctions or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action 

complying with economic sanctions and anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks 

jpmorgan chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” and similar national and multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside the us as well as anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations throughout the world jpmorgan chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements furthermore a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anticorruption or antimoney laundering laws and regulations could subject jpmorgan chase and individual employees to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties 

jpmorgan chase’s operations can be constrained in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks 

if the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less predictable this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business for example any of the following could hamper jpmorgan chase’s operations and reduce its earnings in these types of countries 



 

suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies 

conducting business in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory regimes could require jpmorgan chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures 

there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates and the risk of noncompliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems 

requirements for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase could result in jpmorgan chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses 

jpmorgan chase is required under federal reserve and fdic rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support in the event of material financial distress or failure the agencies’ evaluation of jpmorgan chase’s resolution plan may change and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time any such determinations or modifications could result in jpmorgan chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities which could increase its funding or operational costs or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers 

if the federal reserve and the fdic were to determine that a resolution plan submitted by jpmorgan chase has deficiencies they could jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on jpmorgan chase’s growth activities or operations after two years if the deficiencies are not cured the agencies could also require that jpmorgan chase restructure reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and strategy 

holders of jpmorgan chase  co’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution 

federal reserve rules require that jpmorgan chase  co the “parent company” maintain minimum levels of unsecured external longterm debt and other lossabsorbing capacity with specific terms “eligible ltd” for purposes of recapitalizing jpmorgan chase’s operating subsidiaries if the parent company were to enter into a resolution either 





if the parent company were to enter into a resolution holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company will absorb the losses of the parent company and its subsidiaries 

the preferred “single point of entry” strategy under jpmorgan chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the parent company would enter bankruptcy proceedings jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner as a result the parent company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the parent company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors including holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority as determined by statute and secured creditors of the parent company 

accordingly in a resolution of the parent company in bankruptcy holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of the parent company would realize value only to the extent available to the parent company as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank na and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the parent company have been fully repaid 

the fdic has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution such as the parent company under title ii however the fdic has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy 

if the parent company were to approach or enter into a resolution none of the parent company the federal reserve or the fdic is obligated to follow jpmorgan chase’s preferred strategy and losses to holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company under whatever strategy is ultimately followed could be greater than they might have been under jpmorgan chase’s preferred strategy 

political 

the departure of the uk from the eu could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s business results of operations and operating model 

it remains highly uncertain how the departure of the uk from the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” will affect financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase that conduct substantial operations in the eu from legal entities that are organized in or operating from the uk it is possible that the transition period following the uk’s departure from the eu on january 31 2020 will expire on december 31 2020 without any agreement having been reached between the uk and the eu concerning whether or to what extent ukbased firms may conduct financial services activities within the eu it is also possible that any 

 

agreement reached between the uk and the eu may depending on the final outcome of the ongoing negotiations and related legislative developments 

 jpmorgan chase has been making appropriate modifications to its legal entity structure and operations in the eu the locations in which it operates and the staffing in those locations to address the departure of the uk from the eu if the uk and the eu fail to reach an agreement on their future relationship before the end of the transition period or if any other outcome persists that does not assure ongoing access for ukbased financial services firms to the eu market the types of structural and operational changes that jpmorgan chase is in the process of making to its european operations may result in jpmorgan chase having to sustain a more fragmented operating model across its uk eu and other operating entities due to considerations such as operating expenses liquidity leverage and capital the modified european operating framework will be more complex less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case 

a disorderly withdrawal of the uk from the eu or unexpected consequences of the withdrawal could have significant and immediate destabilizing effects on economic and market conditions in the region and globally in particular crossborder financial services activities could be severely disrupted depending on circumstances that may exist following the withdrawal including 





part i 

 any or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the european financial services market as well as jpmorgan chase’s business operations and earnings in the uk the eu and globally 

economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

the economic environment and market conditions in which jpmorgan chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the us and other countries certain monetary fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in us and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets including 

 these types of political developments and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments could 

 these factors could lead to 



 

 any of these potential outcomes could cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses on its marketmaking positions or in its investment portfolio reduce its liquidity and capital levels hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers and weaken its results of operations and financial condition 

market 

economic and market events and conditions can materially affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and investment and marketmaking positions 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following 

 all of these are affected by global economic market and political events and conditions as well as regulatory restrictions 



in addition jpmorgan chase’s investment portfolio and marketmaking businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events including 

 if jpmorgan chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from marketmaking activities this could reduce jpmorgan chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by us and global economic conditions including 

 a rapid increase in interest rates could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts sustained low growth low or negative interest rates inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses these conditions could also increase the cost to provide those products and services adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce jpmorgan chase’s earnings these consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity or where high levels of consumer debt such as outstanding student loans impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations 

jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers including 



 

 in addition governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could if enacted into law encourage certain of jpmorgan chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and chargeoffs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers 

unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses 

in jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that jpmorgan chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients and therefore the revenue that jpmorgan chase receives from those transactions these factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that jpmorgan chase manages such as loan syndications or securities underwritings furthermore if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur the profitability of jpmorgan chase’s capital markets businesses including its loan syndication securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities could be reduced to the extent that those businesses 

 an adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on clients of jpmorgan chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses jpmorgan chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in or are dependent on any sector of the economy that is under stress 

the fees that jpmorgan chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions for example higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that jpmorgan chase manages or holds under custody which in turn could affect jpmorgan chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody similarly adverse 



part i 

macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from jpmorgan chase funds or accounts or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a jpmorgan chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance 

an economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale clients and thereby diminish jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations for example the businesses of certain of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients severe and sustained adverse economic conditions could reduce the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from those properties which in turn could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans these consequences could result in jpmorgan chase experiencing higher delinquencies defaults and writeoffs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio thereby reducing jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses 

changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of jpmorgan chase’s revenue and income streams 

jpmorgan chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are increasing however higher interest rates can also lead to 

 all of these outcomes could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within jpmorgan chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates if borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments those borrowers may 

 

reduce or stop making payments thereby causing jpmorgan chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans 

on the other hand a low or negative interest rate environment may cause 

 when credit spreads widen it becomes more expensive for jpmorgan chase to borrow jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to jpmorgan chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads will affect positively or negatively jpmorgan chase’s earnings on certain liabilities such as derivatives that are recorded at fair value 

jpmorgan chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments 

the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations market volatility illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments particularly during periods of market displacement subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods in light of factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments in addition at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments the price that jpmorgan chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of jpmorgan chase’s financial instruments which may have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management and monitoring processes including its stress testing framework seek to quantify and control jpmorgan chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves however jpmorgan chase could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur under extreme market conditions hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at 



mitigating losses as they would be under more normal market conditions 

credit 

jpmorgan chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of clients counterparties custodians and ccps 

jpmorgan chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers commercial and investment banks mutual and hedge funds investment managers and other types of financial institutions and market participants many of these transactions expose jpmorgan chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties and can involve jpmorgan chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults jpmorgan chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations including under the eu alternative investment fund managers directive 

a default by or the financial or operational failure of a ccp through which jpmorgan chase executes contracts would require jpmorgan chase to replace those contracts thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses jpmorgan chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a ccp in which jpmorgan chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the ccp because of requirements that each member of the ccp absorb a portion of those losses as part of its clearing services activities jpmorgan chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral jpmorgan chase is also exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management clearing custodial and other transaction services to those clients if a client for which jpmorgan chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent jpmorgan chase may incur losses become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more ccps the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or be subject to regulatory investigations all of the foregoing events can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and litigation costs and jpmorgan chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses jpmorgan chase can also be subject to bearing its share of nondefault losses incurred by a ccp including losses from custodial settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches 

disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral the disposition of those disputes could cause jpmorgan chase to incur unexpected transaction operational and legal costs or result in credit losses these consequences can also impair jpmorgan chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities or cause harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

 

the financial or operational failure of a significant market participant such as a major financial institution or a ccp or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant can have a cascading effect within the financial markets jpmorgan chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting jpmorgan chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with and credit exposure to such a significant market participant and would seek to unwind or hedge positions in securities derivatives and other obligations in multiple jurisdictions during a period of heightened market volatility 

jpmorgan chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity jpmorgan chase’s credit risk may be further increased when jpmorgan chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to it furthermore disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and jpmorgan chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral 

jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk 

jpmorgan chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties 

 for example a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar related or dependent industries this type of interrelationship could exacerbate jpmorgan chase’s credit liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses including fair value losses in its marketmaking businesses 

similarly challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries wherever located these conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or 



part i 

dependent industries to meet their obligations to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or nonbank competitors heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industrywide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to lesscreditworthy borrowers if large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans whether due to weak credit profiles an economic downturn or other factors this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to jpmorgan chase and result in higher chargeoffs and other creditrelated losses more broadly widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the us economy and jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment 

if jpmorgan chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of riskweighted assets “rwa” that jpmorgan chase holds on its balance sheet these factors could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s capital position funding costs and the profitability of its businesses 

liquidity 

liquidity is critical to jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate its businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as 

 a reduction in jpmorgan chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control for example during periods of market stress low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for jpmorgan chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity there is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur 

 

jpmorgan chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lowercost sources of funding such as deposits and borrowings from federal home loan banks is reduced alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability jpmorgan chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that jpmorgan chase may take in order to 

 more generally if jpmorgan chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries including in particular its brokerdealer subsidiaries and thereby adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company that holds the stock of jpmorgan chase bank na and an intermediate holding company jpmorgan chase holdings llc the “ihc” the ihc in turn holds the stock of substantially all of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries other than jpmorgan chase bank na and its subsidiaries the ihc also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding company 

the holding company is obligated to contribute to the ihc substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock 

the ability of jpmorgan chase bank na and the ihc to make payments to the holding company is also limited jpmorgan chase bank na is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company the ihc is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by jpmorgan chase’s management or board of directors 

as a result of these arrangements the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from jpmorgan chase bank na and dividends and extensions of credit from the ihc these limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to 





 these regulatory restrictions and limitations could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the ihc is subject 

reductions in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies rating agencies evaluate both general and firmspecific and industryspecific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution including 

 jpmorgan chase closely monitors and manages to the extent that it is able factors that could influence its credit ratings however there is no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future furthermore any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when jpmorgan chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

a reduction in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings could curtail jpmorgan chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways including 

 any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries this could in turn adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries 

 

the reform and replacement of benchmark rates could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s funding investments and financial products and expose it to litigation and other disputes 

interest rate equity foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” including those in widespread and longstanding use have been the subject of ongoing international national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives and proposals for reform some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration these reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated 

any of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks 

any of these developments and any future initiatives to regulate reform or change the administration of benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on value of and market for loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark including those issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase 

various regulators industry bodies and other market participants in the us and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks there is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmarks that they seek to replace if a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark this could result in widespread dislocation in the financial markets engender volatility in the pricing of securities derivatives and other instruments and suppress capital markets activities all of which could have adverse effects on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations in addition to the extent that appropriate relief is not provided by accounting standard setters with respect to the transition from benchmark rates the transition could 





part i 

has resulted in the modification or extinguishment of specific contracts for accounting purposes 

representatives of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” have made a series of public statements during the past several years to the effect that 

 these statements indicate that it is highly likely that libor will be discontinued on or about the end of 2021 vast amounts of loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the libor benchmark and any inability of market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace libor and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of libor could result in disruption in the financial markets and suppress capital markets activities all of which could have a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations and on liborlinked securities credit or other instruments which are issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients customers counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from libor and other benchmark rates to replacement rates including claims that jpmorgan chase has 



 

these types of claims could subject jpmorgan chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes and harm its reputation 

capital 

maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital is critical to support jpmorgan chase’s business activities meet regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders 

jpmorgan chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements and although many of these requirements have been finalized prudential regulators have recently issued new regulatory capital proposals and continued uncertainty remains as to the manner in which these requirements ultimately will apply to jpmorgan chase as a result it is possible that these requirements could limit jpmorgan chase’s ability to support its businesses and make capital distributions to its shareholders 

jpmorgan chase is required to submit on an annual basis a capital plan describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders redemptions and repurchases of its outstanding securities and other capital actions that it intends to take jpmorgan chase considers various factors in the management of capital including the impact of stress on its capital levels as determined by both internal modeling and the federal reserve’s modeling of jpmorgan chase’s capital position in supervisory stress tests and ccar because the federal reserve and jpmorgan chase use different forecasting models and methodologies when determining stress test results there can be significant differences between the estimates of stress loss as determined by the federal reserve and jpmorgan chase respectively the federal reserve may object to or require modifications to jpmorgan chase’s capital plan or jpmorgan chase may otherwise modify its capital plan and any such modification could have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s shareholders including by 





operational 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of jpmorgan chase’s financial accounting transaction execution data processing and other operational systems to process record monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis and to do so accurately quickly and securely in addition to proper design installation maintenance and training the effective functioning of jpmorgan chase’s operational systems depends on 

 jpmorgan chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors custodians and other market participants including clearing and payment systems ccps securities exchanges and data processing security and technology companies 

the ineffectiveness failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which jpmorgan chase depends including due to a systems malfunction cyberbreach or other systems failure could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including 



 

 as the speed frequency volume interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade jpmorgan chase’s operational systems and infrastructure especially due to the heightened risks that 

 if jpmorgan chase’s operational systems or those of external parties on which jpmorgan chase’s businesses depend are unable to meet the demanding standards of jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings jpmorgan chase could be materially and adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products services and delivery platforms 

when jpmorgan chase launches a new product or service introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services including mobile connectivity electronic trading and cloud computing or makes changes to an existing product service or delivery platform it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes any significant failure in this regard could diminish jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in 





part i 

 any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s connections to external operational systems expose it to greater operational risks 

external operational systems with which jpmorgan is connected whether directly or indirectly can be sources of operational risk to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which jpmorgan chase is directly connected but also to a systems breakdown of another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected similarly retailers data aggregators and other external parties with which jpmorgan chase’s customers do business can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational risk this is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond jpmorgan chase’s security and control systems including through the use of the internet cloud computing services and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services 

if an external party obtains access to customer account data on jpmorgan chase’s systems and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including 

 as jpmorgan chase’s interconnectivity with clients customers and other external parties expands jpmorgan chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to the systems of those parties security breaches affecting jpmorgan chase’s clients or customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties may require jpmorgan chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information including restricting the access of customers to their accounts these actions can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in jpmorgan chase 

 

furthermore the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions central agents ccps payment processors securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to conduct business 

jpmorgan chase’s operations depend on the competence and integrity of its employees and those of external parties 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on the competence and integrity of its employees as well as employees of other parties on which jpmorgan chase’s operations rely including vendors custodians and financial markets infrastructures jpmorgan chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by 

 jpmorgan chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations both within and outside the us governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals the protected parties can include 

 ensuring that jpmorgan chase’s collection use transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict can 





 furthermore jpmorgan chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers vendors counterparties and other external parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and jpmorgan chase particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means jpmorgan chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions if personal confidential or proprietary information of clients customers employees or others were to be mishandled or misused such as situations where such information is 

 concerns regarding the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s measures to safeguard personal information or even the perception that those measures are inadequate could cause jpmorgan chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers and thereby reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues furthermore any failure or perceived failure by jpmorgan chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices significant liabilities or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions any of these could damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses 

in recent years wellpublicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the us and other countries that scrutiny has in some cases resulted in and could in the future lead to the adoption of stricter laws and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information these types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors and thereby increase compliance costs or could restrict jpmorgan chase’s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers these restrictions could also inhibit jpmorgan chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services or increase the costs of offering them to customers 

 

a successful cyberattack against jpmorgan chase could cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers 

jpmorgan chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems software networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors including cybercriminals and “hacktivists” ie individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change these cyberattacks can take many forms but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into jpmorgan chase’s systems these viruses or malicious code are typically designed to 

 jpmorgan chase has also experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services 

jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks however jpmorgan chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers 

a principal reason that jpmorgan chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate detect or recognize threats to jpmorgan chase’s systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches this is because 





part i 

thirdparty service providers or other users of jpmorgan chase’s systems and 

 the risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as jpmorgan chase continues to expand its mobile banking and other internetbased product offerings and its internal use of internetbased products and applications 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences including 

 jpmorgan chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by jpmorgan chase’s employees 

the extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that jpmorgan chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed while such an investigation is ongoing jpmorgan chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack and that damage may continue to spread these factors may inhibit jpmorgan chase’s ability to provide full and reliable information about 

 

the cyberattack to its clients customers counterparties and regulators as well as the public furthermore it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyberattack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack 

jpmorgan chase’s operations results and reputation could be harmed by catastrophes or other events 

jpmorgan chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted and its reputation could be harmed by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control including 

 jpmorgan chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers in particular jpmorgan chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business interruption could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed or conversely if a catastrophic event occurs in an area in which a critical segment of jpmorgan chase’s workforce physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure is concentrated in addition should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions become more chronic the disruptive effects of those events on jpmorgan chase’s business and operations and on its clients customers counterparties and employees could become more significant and longlasting 



any significant failure or disruption of jpmorgan chase’s operations or operational systems or any catastrophic event could 

 jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to jpmorgan chase 

any inadequacy or lapse in jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework governance structure practices models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition any such inadequacy or lapse could 

 jpmorgan chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices these deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting 

many of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior these strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by jpmorgan chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress including difficult or less liquid market environments or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated conversely previouslycorrelated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could in some circumstances limit the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies causing it to incur losses 

 

jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate 

jpmorgan chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations to measure monitor and implement controls over its market credit liquidity operational and other risks these models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary the models and estimations that jpmorgan chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors such as 

 some of the models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations used by jpmorgan chase in managing risks are subject to review by and require the approval of jpmorgan chase’s regulators these reviews are required before jpmorgan chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk rwa credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under basel iii if jpmorgan chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators it may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses jpmorgan chase’s capital actions could also be constrained if a ccar submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations 

enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures 

jpmorgan chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries jpmorgan chase incurs significant costs and 



part i 

expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers jpmorgan chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase specifically any such failure could result in 

 jpmorgan chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” jpmorgan chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements including in determining the allowance for credit losses and reserves related to litigation certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare jpmorgan chase’s financial statements including 

 where quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments jpmorgan chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment and these types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors as noted above in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted if estimates or judgments underlying jpmorgan chase’s financial statements prove to have been incorrect jpmorgan chase may experience material losses 

jpmorgan chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures it then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the amounts of capital and liquidity that would be needed in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to jpmorgan chase’s results of operations and financial condition they require difficult 

 

subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations it is possible that jpmorgan chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s profitability or reputation 

there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur any such lapses or deficiencies could 

 jpmorgan chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies 

the preparation of jpmorgan chase’s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission as well as more detailed accounting policies established by jpmorgan chase’s management from time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change and in some cases these changes could have a significant effect on jpmorgan chase’s financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results 

as of january 1 2020 jpmorgan chase has implemented a new accounting standard commonly referred to as the current expected credit losses “cecl” framework which requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments the allowance for credit losses related to jpmorgan chase’s loans and other lendingrelated commitments increased as a result of the implementation of cecl which has a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s capital levels 

the ongoing impact of the adoption of cecl could include the following each of which could result in diminished investor confidence 





 in addition jpmorgan chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products particularly during periods of economic stress as well as changes related to nonus financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this accounting standard 

strategic 

if jpmorgan chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies jpmorgan chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations these strategies relate to 

 if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments then the franchise values and growth prospects of jpmorgan chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline 

jpmorgan chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities both in the near term and over longer time horizons management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources control expenses and return capital to shareholders each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to 



 

 additionally jpmorgan chase’s board of directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of management’s significant strategic decisions and a failure by the board to perform this function could also impair jpmorgan chase’s results of operations 

jpmorgan chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform technological advances increased public scrutiny and current economic conditions jpmorgan chase expects that competition in the us and global financial services industry will continue to be intense competitors include 

 jpmorgan chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations 

new competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge for example technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products these advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading payments processing and online automated algorithmicbased investment advice furthermore both financial institutions and their nonbanking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies such as cryptocurrencies that require no intermediation new technologies have required and could require jpmorgan chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors including technology companies in addition new technologies may be used by customers or breached or infiltrated by third parties in unexpected ways which can increase jpmorgan chase’s costs for complying with laws and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income 



part i 

that jpmorgan chase earns from providing products and services through those new technologies 

ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for jpmorgan chase’s products and services or may cause jpmorgan chase to lose market share particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts this competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered transaction execution innovation reputation and price the failure of any of jpmorgan chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers whether due to general market conditions underperformance a decision not to offer a particular product or service changes in client and customer expectations or other factors could affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers any such impact could in turn reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues increased competition also may require jpmorgan chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive 

climate change could have a material adverse impact on jpmorgan chase’s business operations clients and customers 

jpmorgan chase operates in many regions countries and communities around the world where its businesses and the activities of its clients and customers could be disrupted by climate change potential physical risks from climate change may include 

 in addition these physical changes may prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for the business models of jpmorgan chase’s clients

 actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect jpmorgan chase’s reputation for example concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole if jpmorgan chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers 

failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions as well as damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation

country 

an outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on jpmorgan chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally 

aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups including armed conflict or intensified cyberattacks could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into fullscale war with potentially catastrophic consequences particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons depending on the scope of the conflict the hostilities could result in 

 any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on jpmorgan chase’s operations and earnings both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally further if the us were to become directly involved in such a conflict this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that jpmorgan chase may have in the affected countries or region as well as in any nation that is aligned against the us in the hostilities jpmorgan chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyberattacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict 

 

jpmorgan chase’s business activities with governmental entities can pose an enhanced risk of loss 

several of jpmorgan chase’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities both within and outside the us these activities can expose jpmorgan chase to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputation risks as governmental entities have in the past and may in the future taken actions such as 

 any or all of these actions could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation particularly if jpmorgan chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers 

jpmorgan chase’s business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local economic political regulatory and social factors 

some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than the us and other developed markets in which jpmorgan chase operates some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including 

 the governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment including 

 the impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller less liquid and more volatile than moredeveloped markets these types of government actions can negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s operations 



in the relevant country either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multinational clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction for example some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to jpmorgan chase or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client being effectively trapped in a country in addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely jpmorgan chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy 

in addition emerging markets countries as well as certain more developed countries have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions as well as natural disasters including 

 these economic political regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in and in the future could lead to conditions that can adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues growth and profitability of those operations in addition any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries including in the us

unfavorable changes in immigration policies could adversely affect the quality of jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations 

jpmorgan chase relies on the skills knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world changes in immigration policies in the us and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce or could prompt jpmorgan chase to make structural changes to its worldwide operating model that are less efficient or more costly 

legal 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties actions currently pending against jpmorgan chase may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions adverse to jpmorgan chase any of these matters could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that jpmorgan chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations 

regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams and jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight this heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of such an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions there is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against jpmorgan chase furthermore a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal state or local agencies and officials in the us or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in nonus jurisdictions 

if another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by jpmorgan chase 



part i 

these and other initiatives by us and nonus governmental authorities may subject jpmorgan chase to judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions and may require jpmorgan chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of these potential outcomes could harm jpmorgan chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs thereby reducing jpmorgan chase’s profitability or result in collateral consequences in addition the extent of jpmorgan chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could in some cases exceed the amount of reserves that jpmorgan chase has established for those matters

significant international regulatory initiatives 

the eu continues to implement an extensive and complex program of regulatory enhancement to address risks associated with global financial institutions the eu operates a european systemic risk board that monitors financial stability and encourages supervisory convergence across the eu’s member states and european supervisory authorities “esas” are responsible for adopting and implementing related rules the eu is currently reviewing the esa framework and the european commission the “ec” has proposed legislation to change the roles and responsibilities of the esas the eu has also created a single supervisory mechanism for the eurozone under which the regulation of all banks in the zone are under the auspices of the european central bank together with a single resolution mechanism and single resolution board which has jurisdiction over the resolution of banks in the zone

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chase’s financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself or combined with other factors materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business results of operations financial condition capital position liquidity competitive position or reputation including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings 

regulatory 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are highly regulated and the laws and regulations that apply to jpmorgan chase have a significant impact on its business and operations 

jpmorgan chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide jpmorgan chase must comply with the laws and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business the regulation of financial services is extensive and comprehensive 

jpmorgan chase has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry both within and outside the us the supervision of financial services firms also expanded significantly during this period the wave of increased regulation and supervision of jpmorgan chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require jpmorgan chase to make further changes to its business and operations these changes could result in jpmorgan chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations and could reduce jpmorgan chase’s profitability more specifically existing and new laws and regulations could require jpmorgan chase to 

 

 

differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for jpmorgan chase’s business 

the content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates and other criteria for example 

 these types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as jpmorgan chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation especially with respect to unregulated financial products 

there can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the us and in other countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory initiative or standard a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase that may be subject to those enhanced regulations 

legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the us could require jpmorgan chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements these include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to 





part i 

these types of differences in financial services regulation or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions could require jpmorgan chase to 

 any or all of these factors could harm jpmorgan chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight or harm jpmorgan chase’s businesses results of operations and profitability 

governments in some countries or regions in which jpmorgan chase does business have adopted laws or regulations which require jpmorgan chase subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity on a standalone basis some regulators outside the us have also proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those jurisdictions these requirements and any future laws or regulations that impose restrictions on the way jpmorgan chase organizes its businesses or increase the capital or liquidity requirements that would apply to jpmorgan chase subsidiaries could hinder jpmorgan chase’s ability to efficiently manage its operations increase its funding and liquidity costs and result in lower profitability 

heightened regulatory scrutiny of jpmorgan chase’s businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where jpmorgan chase does business jpmorgan chase has paid significant fines provided other monetary relief incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies jpmorgan chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in jpmorgan chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions 

in connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions certain regulators have required jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the 

 

activities that gave rise to the resolution these types of admissions can lead to 

 furthermore us government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution including 

 jpmorgan chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions jpmorgan chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions furthermore if jpmorgan chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators it could be required to 

 in these circumstances jpmorgan chase could also become subject to other sanctions or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action 

the longterm impact of us tax reform legislation is uncertain and may be affected by regulatory implementation 

the longterm impact of the tax cuts  jobs acts “tcja” on jpmorgan chase and the us economy remains uncertain while the enactment of the tcja has had and should continue to have a positive impact on jpmorgan chase’s net income the competitive environment and other 



factors will influence the extent to which these benefits are retained by jpmorgan chase over the longer term and the specific impact on jpmorgan chase’s businesses products and geographies may vary in addition the treasury regulations governing certain tcja provisions have not been finalized and their ultimate impact on jpmorgan chase is uncertain 

complying with economic sanctions and anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks 

jpmorgan chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” and similar national and multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside the us as well as anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations throughout the world jpmorgan chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements furthermore a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anticorruption or antimoney laundering laws and regulations could subject jpmorgan chase and individual employees to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties 

jpmorgan chase’s operations can be constrained in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks 

if the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less established or predictable this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business for example any of the following could hamper jpmorgan chase’s operations and reduce its earnings in countries with less established or predictable legal and regulatory regimes 

 conducting business in countries with lessdeveloped legal and regulatory regimes often requires jpmorgan chase to 

 

devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that jpmorgan chase will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators 

requirements for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase could result in jpmorgan chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses 

jpmorgan chase is required under federal reserve and fdic rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support in the event of material financial distress or failure the agencies’ evaluation of the firm’s resolution plan may change and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time any such determinations or modifications could result in jpmorgan chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities which could increase its funding or operational costs 

if the federal reserve and the fdic were to determine that a resolution plan submitted by jpmorgan chase has deficiencies they could jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on jpmorgan chase’s growth activities or operations after two years if the deficiencies are not cured the agencies could also require that jpmorgan chase restructure reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and strategy 

holders of jpmorgan chase  co’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution 

federal reserve rules require that jpmorgan chase  co the “parent company” maintain minimum levels of unsecured external longterm debt and other lossabsorbing capacity with specific terms “eligible ltd” for purposes of recapitalizing jpmorgan chase’s operating subsidiaries if the parent company were to enter into a resolution either 

 if the parent company were to enter into a resolution holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company will absorb the losses of the parent company and its subsidiaries 



part i 

the preferred “single point of entry” strategy under jpmorgan chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the parent company would enter bankruptcy proceedings jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner as a result the parent company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the parent company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors including holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority as determined by statute and secured creditors of the parent company 

accordingly in a resolution of the parent company in bankruptcy holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of the parent company would realize value only to the extent available to the parent company as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank na and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the parent company have been fully repaid 

the fdic has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution such as the parent company under title ii however the fdic has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy 

if the parent company were to approach or enter into a resolution none of the parent company the federal reserve or the fdic is obligated to follow jpmorgan chase’s preferred strategy and losses to holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company under whatever strategy is ultimately followed could be greater than they might have been under jpmorgan chase’s preferred strategy 

political 

the expected departure of the uk from the eu could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s business results of operations and operating model 

it remains highly uncertain how the expected departure of the uk from the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” will affect financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase that conduct substantial operations in the eu from legal entities that are organized in or operating from the uk it is possible that the uk will depart from the eu in march 2019 without any agreement having been reached between the uk and the eu concerning whether or to what extent ukbased firms may conduct financial services activities within the eu it is also possible that any agreement reached between the uk and the eu may depending on the final outcome of the ongoing negotiations and related legislative developments 



 

 jpmorgan chase has been making the necessary modifications to its legal entity structure and operations in the eu the locations in which it operates and the staffing in those locations to address the expected departure of the uk from the eu including the possibility that the uk may depart from the eu in march 2019 without a withdrawal agreement in place if the uk departs from the eu with no withdrawal agreement having been reached the types of structural and operational changes that jpmorgan chase is in the process of making to its european operations will result in jpmorgan chase having to sustain a more fragmented operating model across its uk eu and other operating entities due to considerations such as operating expenses liquidity leverage and capital the modified european operating framework will be more complex less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case jpmorgan chase may experience these types of inefficiencies in its business and operations even if a withdrawal agreement is reached for example in the event that during the transition period contemplated by such an agreement the uk and the eu fail to reach further agreement on future trade relationships between the uk and the eu or if any other outcome persists that does not assure ongoing access for ukbased financial services firms to the eu market 

a disorderly departure of the uk from the eu or the unexpected consequences of any departure could have significant and immediate destabilizing effects on crossborder financial services activities depending on circumstances that may exist following such a withdrawal including 





 any or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the european financial services market as well as jpmorgan chase’s business operations and earnings in the uk the eu and globally 

economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

the economic environment and market conditions in which jpmorgan chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the us and other countries certain policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in us and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets including 

 these types of political developments and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments could 

 these factors could lead to 

 any of these potential outcomes could cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses on its marketmaking positions or in its investment securities portfolio reduce its liquidity and capital levels hamper its ability to deliver products and 

 

services to its clients and customers and weaken its results of operations and financial condition 

market 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market events and conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following 

 jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by us and global economic conditions including 

 a rapid increase in interest rates could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts sustained low growth inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses these conditions could also increase the cost to provide those products and services adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce jpmorgan chase’s earnings these consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity 



part i 

or where high levels of consumer debt such as outstanding student loans impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations 

jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers including 

 in addition governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could if enacted into law encourage certain of jpmorgan chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and chargeoffs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers 

unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses 

in jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that jpmorgan chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients and therefore the revenue that jpmorgan chase receives from those transactions these factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that jpmorgan chase manages such as loan syndications or securities underwritings furthermore if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur the profitability of jpmorgan chase’s capital markets businesses could be reduced to the extent that those businesses 

 an adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on clients of jpmorgan chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses jpmorgan chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in or are dependent on any sector of the economy that is under stress 

 

the fees that jpmorgan chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions for example higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that jpmorgan chase manages or holds under custody which in turn could affect jpmorgan chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody similarly adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from jpmorgan chase funds or accounts or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a jpmorgan chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance 

an economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale clients and thereby diminish jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations for example the businesses of certain of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients severe and sustained adverse economic conditions could reduce the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from those properties which in turn could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans these consequences could result in jpmorgan chase experiencing higher delinquencies defaults and writeoffs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio thereby reducing jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s investment securities portfolio and marketmaking positions can suffer losses due to adverse economic market and political events and conditions 

jpmorgan chase generally maintains positions in various fixed income instruments in its investment securities portfolio and positions in various fixed income currency commodity credit and equity instruments as part of its marketmaking activities marketmaking positions are intended to facilitate demand from jpmorgan chase’s clients for these instruments and to provide liquidity for clients the value of the positions that jpmorgan chase holds can be significantly affected by factors such as 





 all of these are affected by global economic market and political events and conditions as well as regulatory restrictions on marketmaking activities 

jpmorgan chase’s investment securities portfolio and marketmaking businesses can also suffer losses due to unanticipated market events including 

 if jpmorgan chase experiences significant losses in its investment securities portfolio or from marketmaking activities this could reduce jpmorgan chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses 

changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of jpmorgan chase’s revenue and income streams 

jpmorgan chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are increasing however higher interest rates can also lead to 

 all of these outcomes could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within jpmorgan chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates if borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments thereby causing jpmorgan chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans 

 

on the other hand a low interest rate environment may cause 

 when credit spreads widen it becomes more expensive for jpmorgan chase to borrow jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to jpmorgan chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads will affect positively or negatively jpmorgan chase’s earnings on certain liabilities such as derivatives that are recorded at fair value 

jpmorgan chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments 

the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations market volatility illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments particularly during periods of market displacement subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods in light of factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments in addition at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments the price that jpmorgan chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets which may have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations 

under extreme market conditions hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating losses as they would be under more normal market conditions furthermore under these conditions market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale jpmorgan chase’s risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves however severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and jpmorgan chase could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur 



part i 

credit 

jpmorgan chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of clients counterparties custodians and ccps 

jpmorgan chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers commercial and investment banks mutual and hedge funds investment managers and other types of financial institutions many of these transactions expose jpmorgan chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties and can involve jpmorgan chase in disputes and litigation in the event that a client or counterparty defaults jpmorgan chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations including under the eu alternative investment fund managers directive 

a default by a ccp through which jpmorgan chase executes contracts would require jpmorgan chase to replace those contracts thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses jpmorgan chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a ccp in which jpmorgan chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the ccp because of requirements that each member of the ccp absorb a portion of those losses 

disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral the disposition of those disputes could cause jpmorgan chase to incur unexpected transaction operational and legal costs or result in credit losses these consequences can also impair jpmorgan chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities or cause harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses can be harmed by the insolvency of a significant market participant 

the failure of a significant market participant such as a major financial institution or a ccp or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant can have a cascading effect within the financial markets jpmorgan chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting these risks could be magnified in the event of the default insolvency or resolution of a major global financial counterparty as jpmorgan chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with and credit exposure to such a counterparty and would seek to unwind or hedge positions in securities derivatives and other obligations in multiple jurisdictions during a period of heightened market volatility 

 

jpmorgan chase’s clearing services business is exposed to the risk of client or counterparty default 

as part of its clearing services activities jpmorgan chase is a member of several ccps in the event that another member of such an organization defaults on its obligations to the ccp jpmorgan chase may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the ccp as a result of that default as a clearing member jpmorgan chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral jpmorgan chase is exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management clearing custodial and other transaction services to those clients if a client for which jpmorgan chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent jpmorgan chase may incur losses become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more ccps the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or be subject to regulatory investigations all of the foregoing events can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and litigation costs and jpmorgan chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses jpmorgan chase can also be subject to bearing its share of nondefault losses incurred by a ccp due to a business or operational failure affecting the ccp including due to a cyberattack litigation fraud or a systems failure 

jpmorgan chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity jpmorgan chase’s credit risk may be further increased when jpmorgan chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to it furthermore disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and jpmorgan chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral 

jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk 

jpmorgan chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties 

 for example a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other 



borrowers or counterparties in similar related or dependent industries this type of interrelationship could exacerbate jpmorgan chase’s credit liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses including fair value losses in its marketmaking businesses 

similarly challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries wherever located these conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or nonbank competitors heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industrywide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to lesscreditworthy borrowers if large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans whether due to weak credit profiles an economic downturn or other factors this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to jpmorgan chase and result in higher chargeoffs and other creditrelated losses more broadly widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the us economy and jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment 

disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets could cause jpmorgan chase to be unable to sell syndicate or realize the value of its positions in various debt instruments loans derivatives and other obligations and thereby lead to increased risk concentrations if jpmorgan chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of riskweighted assets “rwa” that jpmorgan chase holds on its balance sheet these factors could increase jpmorgan chase’s capital requirements and funding costs and adversely affect the profitability of jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

liquidity 

liquidity is critical to jpmorgan chase’s ability to fund and operate its businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as 



 

 a diminution of jpmorgan chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control for example during the 20082009 financial crisis periods of low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity resulted in higher funding costs for jpmorgan chase and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity including securitized debt issuances there is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur in the future 

jpmorgan chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lowercost sources of funding such as deposits and borrowings from federal home loan banks is reduced alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability jpmorgan chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that jpmorgan chase may take in order to 

 more generally if jpmorgan chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and thereby adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company that holds the stock of jpmorgan chase bank na and an intermediate holding company jpmorgan chase holdings llc the “ihc” the ihc in turn holds the stock of substantially all of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries other than jpmorgan chase bank na and its subsidiaries the ihc also owns other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to the holding company 

the holding company is obligated to contribute to the ihc substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock 

the ability of jpmorgan chase bank na and the ihc to make payments to the holding company is also 



part i 

limited jpmorgan chase bank na is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company the ihc is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by jpmorgan chase’s management or board of directors 

as a result of these arrangements the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from jpmorgan chase bank na and dividends and extensions of credit from the ihc these limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to 

 these regulatory restrictions and limitations could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the ihc is subject 

reductions in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies rating agencies evaluate both general and firmspecific and industryspecific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution including 

 jpmorgan chase closely monitors and manages to the extent that it is able factors that could influence its credit ratings however there is no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future furthermore any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when jpmorgan chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

a reduction in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings could curtail jpmorgan chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways including 



 

 any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries this could in turn adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries 

the regulation reform and replacement of benchmark rates could have adverse consequences on jpmorgan chase’s securities issuances and its capital markets and investment activities 

interest rate equity foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” including those in widespread and longstanding use have been the subject of ongoing international national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives and proposals for reform some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration these reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated 

any of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks 

any of these developments and any future initiatives to regulate reform or change the administration of benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on value of and market for loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark including those issued funded or held by jpmorgan chase 

various regulators industry bodies and other market participants in the us and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks there is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmarks that they seek to replace if a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark this could result in widespread 



dislocation in the financial markets engender volatility in the pricing of securities derivatives and other instruments and suppress capital markets activities all of which could have adverse effects on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations in addition the transition of a particular benchmark to a replacement rate could affect hedge accounting relationships between financial instruments linked to that benchmark and any related derivatives which could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s results 

on july 27 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021 and there is a substantial risk that libor will be discontinued or modified by 2021 vast amounts of loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the libor benchmark and any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace libor and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of libor could as noted above result in disruption in the financial markets suppress capital markets activities and give rise to litigation claims all of which could have a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s results of operations and on liborlinked securities or other instruments which are issued funded or held by jpmorgan chase 

operational 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of jpmorgan chase’s financial accounting transaction execution data processing and other operational systems to process record monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis and to do so accurately quickly and securely in addition to proper design installation maintenance and training the effective functioning of jpmorgan chase’s operational systems depends on 

 jpmorgan chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors custodians and 

 

other market participants including clearing and payment systems ccps securities exchanges and data processing security and technology companies 

the ineffectiveness failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which jpmorgan chase depends including due to a systems malfunction cyberbreach or other systems failure could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including 

 as the speed frequency volume interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continues to increase it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade jpmorgan chase’s operational systems and infrastructure especially due to the heightened risks that 

 if jpmorgan chase’s operational systems or those of external parties on which jpmorgan chase’s businesses depend are unable to meet the demanding standards of jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations or if they fail 



part i 

or have other significant shortcomings jpmorgan chase could be materially and adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products services and delivery platforms 

when jpmorgan chase launches a new product or service introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services including mobile connectivity electronic trading and cloud computing or makes changes to an existing product service or delivery platform it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes for example ineffective controls over newlydeveloped electronic trading platforms could inadvertently permit the rapid buildup of unexpected abnormal or unusually large positions in securities or other financial instruments or fail to anticipate or address a downturn in market liquidity which leads to sudden or severe changes in asset prices any significant failure to identify and mitigate operational risks associated with new products or services or new platforms for delivering or distributing products or services or changes to existing products services or delivery platforms could diminish jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in 

 any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s connections to external operational systems expose it to greater operational risks 

external operational systems with which jpmorgan is connected whether directly or indirectly can be sources of operational risk to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which jpmorgan chase is directly connected but also to a systems breakdown of another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected similarly retailers data aggregators and other external parties with which jpmorgan chase’s customers do business can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational risk this is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond jpmorgan chase’s security and control systems 

 

including through the use of the internet personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services 

if an external party obtains access to customer account data on jpmorgan chase’s systems and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including 

 as jpmorgan chase’s interconnectivity with clients customers and other external parties expands jpmorgan chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to the systems of those parties security breaches affecting jpmorgan chase’s clients or customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties may require jpmorgan chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information including restricting the access of customers to their accounts these actions can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction 

furthermore the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions central agents ccps payment processors securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to conduct business 

jpmorgan chase’s operations depend on the competence and integrity of its employees and those of external parties 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably and to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers is highly dependent on the competence and trustworthiness of its employees as well as employees of other parties on which jpmorgan chase’s operations rely including vendors custodians and financial markets infrastructures jpmorgan chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure theft fraud or other unlawful conduct or other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an 



employee of jpmorgan chase or of another party on which jpmorgan chase’s operations depend 

jpmorgan chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations both within and outside the us governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals the protected parties can include 

 ensuring that jpmorgan chase’s collection use transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict can 

 furthermore jpmorgan chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers vendors counterparties and other external parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and jpmorgan chase particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means jpmorgan chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions if personal confidential or proprietary information of clients customers employees or others were to be mishandled or misused such as situations where such information is 

 concerns regarding the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s measures to safeguard personal information or even the perception that those measures are inadequate could cause jpmorgan chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers and thereby reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues furthermore any failure or perceived failure by jpmorgan chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection 

 

laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices significant liabilities or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions any of these could damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses 

recent wellpublicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the us and other countries that scrutiny has in some cases resulted in and could in the future lead to the adoption of stricter laws and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information these types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors and thereby increase compliance costs or could restrict jpmorgan chase’s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers these restrictions could inhibit jpmorgan chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services or increase the costs of offering them to customers 

a successful cyberattack against jpmorgan chase could cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers 

jpmorgan chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems software networks and other technology assets on a daily basis these cyberattacks can take many forms but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into jpmorgan chase’s systems these viruses or malicious code are typically designed to 

 jpmorgan chase has also experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services 

jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks however jpmorgan chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers 



part i 

a principal reason that jpmorgan chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate detect or recognize threats to jpmorgan chase’s systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches this is because 

 the risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as jpmorgan chase continues to expand its mobilepayments and other internetbased product offerings and its internal use of webbased products and applications 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences including 

 jpmorgan chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate 

 

confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by jpmorgan chase’s employees 

jpmorgan chase may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a security breach due to a cyberattack 

a successful breach of jpmorgan chase’s computer systems software networks or other technology assets due to a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to 

 the extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that jpmorgan chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known while such an investigation is ongoing jpmorgan chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack and that damage may continue to spread furthermore it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyberattack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack 

jpmorgan chase’s operations results and reputation could be harmed by catastrophes or other events 

jpmorgan chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted and its reputation could be harmed by events that are wholly or partially beyond its control including 





 jpmorgan chase maintains a firmwide resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure the ability to recover critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers furthermore should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions become more chronic the disruptive effects of those events on jpmorgan chase’s business and operations and on its clients customers counterparties and employees could become more significant and longlasting 

any significant failure or disruption of jpmorgan chase’s operations or operational systems or any catastrophic event could 

 jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework and procedures may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework is intended to mitigate risk and loss the framework includes both the “first line of defense” consisting of each line of business and treasury and the chief investment office including their aligned operations technology and control management groups and the “second line of defense” consisting of independent risk management jpmorgan chase has established processes and procedures to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject however there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may be existing or future risks that jpmorgan chase has not appropriately anticipated or identified 

any inadequacy or lapse in jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework governance structure procedures and practices models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition any such inadequacy or lapse could 



 

 jpmorgan chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices these deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting 

jpmorgan chase establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures it then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to jpmorgan chase’s results of operations and financial condition they require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations it is possible that jpmorgan chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

many of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior these strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by jpmorgan chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress including difficult or less liquid market environments or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated conversely previouslycorrelated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could in some circumstances limit the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies causing it to incur losses 

jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate 

jpmorgan chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations to assess and implement mitigating controls over its market credit liquidity operational and other risks these models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary the models and estimations that jpmorgan chase uses may not be effective in all cases to 



part i 

identify observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors such as 

 some of the models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations used by jpmorgan chase in managing risks are subject to review by and require the approval of jpmorgan chase’s regulators these reviews are required before jpmorgan chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk rwa credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under basel iii if jpmorgan chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators it may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses jpmorgan chase’s capital actions could also be constrained if a ccar submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations 

enhanced standards for vendor risk management can result in higher costs and other potential exposures 

jpmorgan chase must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with doing business with vendors and other thirdparty service providers these requirements are contained both in bank regulatory regulations and guidance and in certain consent orders to which jpmorgan chase has been subject jpmorgan chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships jpmorgan chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage thirdparty relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase specifically any such failure could result in 



 

 requirements for physical settlement and delivery in trading agreements could expose jpmorgan chase to operational and other risks 

certain of jpmorgan chase’s markets transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that jpmorgan chase does not own if jpmorgan chase is unable to obtain the obligations within the required timeframe jpmorgan chase could forfeit payments otherwise due failures could also result in settlement delays which could damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and ability to transact business failure to timely settle and confirm transactions could also subject jpmorgan chase to heightened credit and operational risk and losses in the event of a default 

jpmorgan chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” jpmorgan chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare jpmorgan chase’s financial statements including 

 where quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments jpmorgan chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted if estimates or judgments underlying jpmorgan chase’s financial statements prove to have been incorrect jpmorgan chase may experience material losses 

lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s profitability or reputation 

there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur any such lapses or deficiencies could 



 jpmorgan chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies 

the preparation of jpmorgan chase’s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission as well as more detailed accounting policies established by jpmorgan chase’s management from time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change and in some cases these changes could have a material effect on jpmorgan chase’s financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results 

for example on january 1 2020 jpmorgan chase and other us companies will be required to implement a new accounting standard commonly referred to as the current expected credit losses “cecl” framework which will require earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use jpmorgan chase expects that under cecl it will need to among other things increase the allowance for credit losses related to its loans and other lendingrelated commitments which may have a negative impact on its capital levels 

this new accounting standard may result in greater volatility of jpmorgan chase’s earnings and capital levels over economic cycles and could potentially affect jpmorgan chase’s capital distribution plans depending upon final guidance from the regulators in addition jpmorgan chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products particularly during periods of economic stress as well as changes related to nonus financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this new accounting standard 

 

strategic 

if jpmorgan chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies jpmorgan chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and results of operations these strategies relate to 

 if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments then the franchise values and growth prospects of jpmorgan chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline 

jpmorgan chase’s growth and prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities both in the near term and over longer time horizons management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources control expenses and return capital to shareholders each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to 





part i 

 additionally jpmorgan chase’s board of directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of management’s strategic decisions and a failure by the board to perform this function could also impair jpmorgan chase’s results of operations 

conduct 

conduct failure by jpmorgan chase employees can harm clients and customers impact market integrity damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action 

jpmorgan chase’s employees interact with clients customers and counterparties and with each other every day all employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of jpmorgan chase’s how we do business principles including jpmorgan chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way” jpmorgan chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle including recruiting onboarding training and development and performance management conduct risk management is also an integral component of jpmorgan chase’s promotion and compensation processes 

notwithstanding these expectations policies and practices certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct and these instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation as well as resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders deferred prosecution agreements nonprosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions there is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be detected deterred or prevented 

jpmorgan chase’s reputation could be harmed and collateral consequences could result from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with jpmorgan chase’s expectations policies and practices including by acting in ways that harm clients customers other market participants or other employees some examples of this include 



 

 the consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with jpmorgan chase’s expectations policies or practices could include litigation or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions or lead to 

 loss of clients or customers and 

 reputation 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could harm its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients customers investors and employees damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase’s business and prospects harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including 





jpmorgan chase’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of certain third parties to comply with laws or regulations including companies in which jpmorgan chase has made principal investments parties to joint ventures with jpmorgan chase and vendors and other third parties with which jpmorgan chase does business 

jpmorgan chase’s reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding jpmorgan chase whether or not true that may be posted on social media nonmainstream news services or other parts of the internet and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels 

social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to the health of consumers or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment workers’ rights or communities activists have also engaged in public protests at jpmorgan chase’s headquarters and other properties activist criticism of jpmorgan chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients customers investors and employees with how jpmorgan chase addresses social and environmental concerns in its business activities alternatively yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage jpmorgan chase’s relationships with clients and customers and with governmental bodies in jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase does business whose views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists in either case the resulting harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could 

 any of the above factors could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s results of operations and its ability to maintain its competitive standing 

actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect jpmorgan chase’s reputation for example concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole if jpmorgan chase is perceived to have 

 

engaged in these types of behaviors the measures needed to address the associated reputational issues could increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and compliance costs and negatively affect its earnings 

failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions as well as damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as its business activities encompass more transactions obligations and interests with and among jpmorgan chase’s clients and customers jpmorgan chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions and its reputation can be damaged by the failure or perceived failure to 

 in the future a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

country 

adverse economic and political developments in a country or region or globally can have a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings can be affected by the monetary fiscal and other policies adopted by regulatory authorities and agencies in the countries in which jpmorgan chase operates changes in fiscal policies by central banks or regulatory authorities and the manner in which those policies are executed are beyond jpmorgan chase’s control and may be difficult to predict consequently unanticipated changes in these policies or the ways in which they are implemented could have a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations 

some countries or regions in which jpmorgan chase operates or invests or in which jpmorgan chase may do business in the future have in the past experienced severe 



part i 

economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries or the possibility that a particular country may decide to depart from a trade monetary or political pact can result in a deterioration of economic and market conditions within the affected countries or regions including 

 any or all of these factors could have a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s business and results of operations in the affected country or region 

these developments can also lead to a contagion which causes similar conditions to arise in other countries in the same region or beyond furthermore governments in particular countries or regions in which jpmorgan chase or its clients do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions or as countermeasures to policies or actions taken by other countries or regions any or all of these developments could lead to diminished crossborder trade and financing activity within that country or region all of which could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s business and earnings in those jurisdictions and increase its operational costs if jpmorgan chase takes steps to reduce its market and credit risk exposure within a particular country or region that is experiencing economic or political disruption it may incur losses that are higher than expected because it will be disposing of assets when market conditions are likely to be highly unfavorable 

an outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on jpmorgan chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally 

aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups including armed conflict or intensified cyberattacks could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into fullscale war with potentially catastrophic consequences particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons depending on the scope of the conflict the hostilities could result in 



 

 any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on jpmorgan chase’s operations and earnings both in the countries or region directly affected by the hostilities or globally further if the us were to become directly involved in such a conflict this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that jpmorgan chase may have in the affected countries or region as well as in any nation that is aligned against the us in the hostilities jpmorgan chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyberattacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict 

jpmorgan chase’s business activities with governmental entities can pose an enhanced risk of loss 

several of jpmorgan chase’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities both within and outside the us these activities can expose jpmorgan chase to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputation risks including the risks that a governmental entity may 

 any or all of these actions could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation particularly if jpmorgan chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers 

jpmorgan chase’s business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local economic political regulatory and social factors 

some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than the us and other developed markets in which jpmorgan chase operates some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including 





 the governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment including 

 the impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller less liquid and more volatile than moredeveloped markets these types of government actions can negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s operations in the relevant country either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multinational clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction for example some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to jpmorgan chase or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client being effectively trapped in a country in addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely jpmorgan chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy 

in addition emerging markets countries as well as certain more developed countries have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions including 

 these economic political regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in and in the future could lead to conditions that can adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues growth and profitability of those operations in addition any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries including in the us 

 

competition 

the financial services industry is highly competitive and jpmorgan chase’s results of operations will suffer if it is not a strong effective and forwardlooking competitor 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects that competition in the us and global financial services industry will continue to be intense competitors include 

 jpmorgan chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations 

new competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge for example technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products these advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading payments processing and online automated algorithmicbased investment advice furthermore both financial institutions and their nonbanking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies such as cryptocurrencies that require no intermediation new technologies have required and could require jpmorgan chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors including technology companies in addition new technologies may be used by customers or breached or infiltrated by third parties in unexpected ways which can increase jpmorgan chase’s costs for complying with laws and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that jpmorgan chase earns from providing products and services through those new technologies 

ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for jpmorgan chase’s products and services or may cause jpmorgan chase to lose market share particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts this competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered transaction execution innovation reputation and price the failure of any of jpmorgan chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers whether due to general market conditions underperformance a decision not to offer a particular product or service changes in client and customer expectations or other 



part i 

factors could affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers any such impact could in turn reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues increased competition also may require jpmorgan chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive 

nonus competitors of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses outside the us are typically subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes the more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to jpmorgan chase and other us financial services institutions can put jpmorgan chase and those firms at a competitive disadvantage to nonus competitors this could reduce the revenue and profitability of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses resulting from 

 people 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are its most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense jpmorgan chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees if jpmorgan chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees including successors to the chief executive officer or members of the operating committee jpmorgan chase’s performance including its competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 

unfavorable changes in immigration policies could adversely affect the quality of jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations 

jpmorgan chase relies on the skills knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world changes in immigration policies in the us and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce or could prompt jpmorgan chase to make structural changes to its worldwide operating model that are less efficient or more costly 

 

legal 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties actions currently pending against jpmorgan chase may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions adverse to jpmorgan chase any of these matters could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that jpmorgan chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations 

regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams and jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight this heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of such an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions there is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against jpmorgan chase furthermore a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal state or local agencies and officials in the us or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in nonus jurisdictions 

if another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by jpmorgan chase 

these and other initiatives by us and nonus governmental authorities may subject jpmorgan chase to judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions and may require jpmorgan chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of these potential outcomes could harm jpmorgan chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs thereby reducing jpmorgan chase’s profitability or result in collateral consequences in addition the extent of jpmorgan chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could in some cases exceed the amount of reserves that jpmorgan chase has established for those matters

stress tests  the federal reserve has adopted supervisory stress tests for large bank holding companies including jpmorgan chase which form part of the federal reserve’s annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” framework under the framework  the firm must conduct semiannual companyrun stress tests and in addition must submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by  the firm and the federal reserve in reviewing  the firm’s capital plan the federal reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors qualitative assessments include among other things the comprehensiveness of the plan the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan and the extent to which  the firm has satisfied certain supervisory matters related to  the firm’s processes and analyses including the design and operational effectiveness of the controls governing such processes moreover  the firm is required to receive a notice of nonobjection from the federal reserve before taking capital actions such as paying dividends implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the occ requires jpmorgan chase bank na to perform separate similar annual stress tests  the firm publishes each year the results of its midcycle stress tests under  the firm’s internallydeveloped “severely adverse” scenario and the results of its and its two primary subsidiary banks’ annual stress tests under the supervisory “severely adverse” scenarios provided by the federal reserve and the occ  the firm is required to file its 2018 annual ccar submission on april 5

certain financial companies including jpmorgan chase and certain of its subsidiaries can also be subjected to resolution under an “orderly liquidation authority” the us treasury secretary in consultation with the president of the united states must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations and action must be recommended by the fdic and the federal reserve absent such actions  the firm  as a bhc would remain subject to resolution under the bankruptcy code in december 2013 the fdic issued a draft policy statement 



part i 

describing its “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of systemically important financial institutions under the orderly liquidation authority this strategy seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of the bhc open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority  for further information see risk factors on pages 8–26  

the fdic also requires each insured depository institution “idi” with 50 billion or more in assets such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na to provide an idi resolution plan 

the firm has a comprehensive recovery plan detailing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining wellcapitalized and wellfunded in the case of an adverse event jpmorgan chase has provided the federal reserve with comprehensive confidential supervisory information and analyses about the firm’s businesses legal entities and corporate governance and about its crisis management governance capabilities and available alternatives to generate liquidity and capital in severe market circumstances the occ has published guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks and jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na have submitted their recovery plans to the occ   in addition certain of  the firm’s nonus subsidiaries are subject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate   

regulators in the us and abroad have proposed and implemented measures designed to address the possibility or perception that large financial institutions including  the firm may be “too big to fail” and to provide safeguards so that if a large financial institution does fail it can be resolved without the use of public funds higher capital surcharges on  global systemically important banks “gsibs” requirements for certain large bank holding companies to maintain a minimum amount of longterm debt to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms referred to as total loss absorbing capacity “tlac” and the international swaps and derivatives association “isda” protocol relating to the “closeout” of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large crossborder financial institution are examples of initiatives to address “too big to fail”   for further information  on the gsib framework and tlac see capital risk management on pages 82–91  and risk factors on pages 8–26  and on the isda closeout protocol see derivatives regulation below   

holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries  jpmorgan chase  co is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when  the firm might otherwise determine not to provide it   

regulation of acquisitions acquisitions by bank holding companies and their banks are subject to multiple requirements by the federal reserve and the occ for example financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the 

 

federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank in addition acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if as a result of the acquisition the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10 of the total liabilities of all financial companies in addition for certain acquisitions  the firm must provide written notice to the federal reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over 10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in nature” 

jpmorgan chase’s subsidiary banks

significant international regulatory initiatives 

in the eu there is an extensive and complex program of final and proposed regulatory enhancement that reflects in part the eu’s commitments to policies of the group of twenty finance ministers and central bank governors “g20” together with other plans specific to the eu the eu operates a european systemic risk board that monitors financial stability together with european supervisory authorities “esa” that set detailed regulatory rules and encourage supervisory convergence across the eu’s member states the eu is currently reviewing the esa framework the eu has also created a single supervisory mechanism for the eurozone under which the regulation of all banks in that zone will be under the auspices of the european central bank together with a single resolution mechanism and single resolution board having jurisdiction over bank resolution in the zone at both the g20 and eu 



part i 

levels various proposals are under consideration to address risks associated with global financial institutions     

in the eu this includes emir which requires among other things the central clearing of certain standardized derivatives and risk mitigation for uncleared otc derivatives and mifid ii which gives effect to the g20 commitment to move trading of standardized otc derivatives to exchanges or electronic trading platforms mifid ii significantly enhances requirements for pre and posttrade transparency transaction reporting and investor protection mifid ii also introduces a commodities position limits and reporting regime emir became effective in 2012 although some requirements apply on a phased basis and certain aspects of the regulation are currently being reviewed mifid ii became effective across eu member states on january 3 2018 after a oneyear delay 

the eu is also currently considering or implementing significant revisions to laws covering securities settlement mutual funds and pensions payments antimoney laundering controls data security and privacy transparency and disclosure of securities financing transactions benchmarks resolution of banks investment firms and market infrastructures and capital and liquidity requirements for banks and investment firms the capital and liquidity legislation for banks and investment firms will implement in the eu many of the finalized basel iii capital and liquidity standards including in relation to the leverage ratio market risk capital and a net stable funding ratio the legislation also proposes an intermediate parent undertaking “ipu” requirement for foreign banks which will require noneu banks operating in europe with total eu assets greater than eur30 billion or which are part of a gsib to establish a single eulocated ipu the full impact of the proposal on jpm’s eu operations and legal entities will be heavily influenced by the outcome of the eu legislative process including whether any flexibility is introduced to the requirement   

consistent with the g20 and eu policy frameworks uk regulators have adopted a range of policy measures that have significantly changed the markets and prudential regulatory environment in the uk in addition uk regulators have introduced measures to enhance accountability of individuals and promote forwardlooking conduct risk identification and mitigation including by introducing the senior managers and certification regimes 

on june 23 2016 the uk voted by referendum to leave the european union the uk government invoked article 50 of the lisbon treaty on march 29 2017 starting a twoyear period for the formal exit negotiations this means that the uk will leave the eu on march 29 2019 unless the timeline is unanimously extended by the remaining 27 eu member states “eu27” and the uk in december 2017 the eu27 agreed that “sufficient progress” had been made on the terms of the uk’s withdrawal to allow parallel talks on the future relationship which are expected to begin in march 2018 the uk’s priorities in negotiating the future relationship are to seek a bilateral free trade agreement 

 

with the eu27 that facilitates the “greatest possible access” to the single market however the uk will not seek to continue its membership in the single market the current eu27 position is that a free trade agreement should be balanced ambitious and wideranging that the uk’s participation in the single market or parts thereof must end and that there will not be any sectorspecific carveouts such as for financial services both the eu27 and the uk are open to the idea of a “transitional arrangement”   the uk’s departure from the eu will have a significant impact across  the firm’s european businesses including business and legal entity reorganization and may lead to direct and indirect changes to eu27 and uk regulatory approaches the situation remains highly uncertain particularly in relation to whether a transition period is implemented and whether financial services will be included in any future free trade agreement   




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chase ’s financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm 

regulatory 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are highly regulated and the laws and regulations that apply to jpmorgan chase have a significant impact on its operations 

jpmorgan chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide jpmorgan chase must comply with the laws and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business the regulation of financial services activities is typically extensive and comprehensive 

in recent years legislators and regulators adopted a wide range of new laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry both within and outside the us the supervision of financial services firms also expanded significantly during this period the wave of increased regulation and supervision of jpmorgan chase has affected the way that it conducts and structures its operations existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require jpmorgan chase to make further changes to its operations these changes could result in jpmorgan chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations or losing a significant amount of revenue and could reduce jpmorgan chase’s profitability more specifically existing and new laws and regulations could require jpmorgan chase to 





 differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for jpmorgan chase’s business 

the content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates or other criteria for example 

 there can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the us and in different countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example legislative and regulatory initiatives within the eu could require jpmorgan chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in that region in order to comply with those requirements these include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to 

 these types of differences in financial services regulation or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions could require jpmorgan chase to among other things 

 

 any or all of these factors could harm jpmorgan chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight or harm jpmorgan chase’s businesses results of operations and profitability 

governments in some countries in which jpmorgan chase does business have adopted laws or regulations which require that jpmorgan chase subsidiaries which operate in those countries maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity on a standalone basis some regulators outside the us have also proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries these requirements and any future laws or regulations that impose restrictions on the way jpmorgan chase organizes its businesses or increase the capital or liquidity requirements that would apply to jpmorgan chase subsidiaries could hinder jpmorgan chase’s ability to efficiently manage its operations increase its funding and liquidity costs and result in lower profitability 

heightened regulatory scrutiny of jpmorgan chase’s businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where jpmorgan chase does business jpmorgan chase has paid significant fines or provided other monetary relief in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies jpmorgan chase could become subject to similar regulatory settlements or other actions in the future and addressing the requirements of any such settlement could result in jpmorgan chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs 

in connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions certain regulators have required jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the settlement these types of admissions can lead to 





part i 

 furthermore us government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have increasingly demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions in the case of jpmorgan chase these resolutions have included 

 resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution including loss of clients customers and business the inability to offer certain products or services or losing permission to operate certain businesses either temporarily or permanently 

jpmorgan chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to expanded regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions jpmorgan chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions furthermore if jpmorgan chase fails to meet the requirements of any governmental settlements and other actions to which it is subject or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators it could be required to among other things 

 the extent of jpmorgan chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could in some cases exceed the amount of reserves that jpmorgan chase has established for those matters 

requirements for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase could result in jpmorgan chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses 

jpmorgan chase is required under the doddfrank act and federal reserve and fdic rules to prepare and submit 

 

periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support in the event of material financial distress or failure the agencies’ evaluation of the firm’s resolution plan may change and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time any such determinations or modifications could result in jpmorgan chase making changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities that could increase funding or operational costs 

if the federal reserve and the fdic were to determine that a future resolution plan submitted by jpmorgan chase has deficiencies they could jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on jpmorgan chase’s growth activities or operations after two years if the deficiencies are not cured the agencies could also require that jpmorgan chase restructure reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and strategy   

holders of jpmorgan chase  co’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution 

federal reserve rules require that jpmorgan chase  co the “holding company” maintain minimum levels of unsecured external longterm debt and other lossabsorbing capacity with specific terms “eligible ltd” for purposes of recapitalizing jpmorgan chase’s operating subsidiaries if the holding company were to enter into a resolution either 

 if the holding company were to enter into a resolution holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the holding company will absorb the losses of the holding company and its affiliates 

the preferred “single point of entry” strategy under jpmorgan chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the holding company would enter bankruptcy proceedings jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner as a result the holding company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the holding company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors including holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority as determined by statute and secured creditors of the holding company 

accordingly in a resolution of the holding company in bankruptcy holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of the holding company would realize value only to the 



extent available to the holding company as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank na and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the holding company have been fully repaid 

the fdic has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution such as the holding company under title ii however the fdic has not to date formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy 

if the holding company were to enter into a resolution none of the holding company the federal reserve or the fdic is obligated to follow jpmorgan chase’s preferred strategy and losses to holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the holding company under whatever strategy is ultimately followed could be greater 

political 

political developments can cause uncertainty concerning the regulatory environment in which jpmorgan chase operates its businesses 

recent elections and referendums in the us and abroad have introduced uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment in which jpmorgan chase and other financial services firms will operate in the future for example the uk’s planned departure from the eu has engendered significant uncertainty concerning the regulatory framework under which global financial services institutions including jpmorgan chase will need to conduct their business in the uk and the eu depending on the nature of the arrangements agreed between the uk and the eu including with respect to the ability of financial services companies to engage in business in the eu from legal entities organized in or operating from the uk jpmorgan chase may need to make significant changes to its legal entity structure and operations and the locations in which it operates these types of structural and operational changes could result in jpmorgan chase needing to implement an operating model across its european legal entities that is less efficient or costeffective 

the result of an election may suggest that the new administration will ease the regulatory requirements that apply to financial services firms however it is equally possible that the potential for reduced regulation does not occur or is reversed by another regulator or by a subsequent administration or that deregulation measures that are ultimately enacted deliver significant competitive advantages to financial services firms that are structured differently or serve different markets than jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase cannot predict political developments of this nature or whether they will have favorable or unfavorable longterm effects on its businesses 

economic uncertainty caused by political developments can hurt jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

the economic environment and market conditions in which jpmorgan chase operates continue to be uncertain due to 

 

recent political developments in the us and abroad certain policy proposals including isolationist foreign policies protectionist trade policies or the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for gses could cause a contraction in us and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets these types of political developments could among other things 

 these factors could lead to greater market volatility largescale sales of us government debt and other us debt and equity securities the widening of credit spreads and other market dislocations any of these potential outcomes could cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses in its investment securities portfolio reduce its capital levels hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers and weaken its results of operations 

political developments in other parts of the world have also led to uncertainty in global economic conditions including 

 jpmorgan chase’s results of operations can be adversely affected by the uncertainty arising from significant political developments and any market volatility or disruption that results from that uncertainty 

the positive impact of us tax reform legislation on jpmorgan chase may diminish over time 

the longterm impact of the tax reform legislation recently enacted in the us on jpmorgan chase and the us economy is not yet known while the tax reform will have a positive impact on jpmorgan chase’s net income the competitive environment and other factors will influence the extent to which these benefits are retained by jpmorgan chase over the longer term in addition the specific impact on jpmorgan chase’s businesses products and geographies may vary 

market 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following 





part i 

currencies commodities interest rates and other market indices 

 jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by us domestic economic conditions including 

 sustained low growth in the us economy could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses it could also increase the cost to provide those products and services adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies in mortgage credit card auto and other loans and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce jpmorgan chase’s earnings these consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity 

jpmorgan chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by changes in government policies that affect consumers including those relating to medical insurance immigration and employment status as well as governmental policies aimed at the economy more broadly such as infrastructure spending and global trade which could result in among other things higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income 

in jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that jpmorgan chase executes for its clients and therefore the revenue that jpmorgan chase receives from those transactions these factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that jpmorgan chase manages such as loan syndications or securities underwritings furthermore if a significant and sustained 

 

deterioration in market conditions were to occur the profitability of jpmorgan chase’s capital markets businesses could be reduced to the extent that those businesses 

 jpmorgan chase’s investment securities portfolio and marketmaking positions can suffer losses due to adverse economic market and political events and conditions 

jpmorgan chase generally maintains positions in various fixed income instruments in its investment securities portfolio and positions in various fixed income currency commodity credit and equity instruments as part of its marketmaking activities marketmaking positions are intended to facilitate demand from jpmorgan chase’s clients for these instruments and to provide liquidity for clients the value of the positions that jpmorgan chase holds can be significantly affected by factors such as 

 all of these are affected by global economic market and political events and conditions as well as regulatory restrictions on marketmaking activities 

jpmorgan chase’s investment securities portfolio and marketmaking businesses can also suffer losses due to unanticipated market events including 

 if jpmorgan chase experiences significant losses in its investment securities portfolio or from marketmaking activities this could reduce jpmorgan chase’s profitability and its capital levels and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses 



jpmorgan chase’s asset and wealth management and custody businesses may earn lower fee revenue during adverse macroeconomic conditions 

the fees that jpmorgan chase earns from managing thirdparty assets or holding assets in custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions for example higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that jpmorgan chase manages or holds in custody which in turn could affect jpmorgan chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody similarly adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from jpmorgan chase funds or accounts or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a jpmorgan chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance 

changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of jpmorgan chase’s revenue and income streams 

jpmorgan chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are high or increasing however higher interest rates can also lead to 

 all of these outcomes could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s revenues and capital levels higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within jpmorgan chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates if borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments thereby causing jpmorgan chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans 

on the other hand a low interest rate environment may cause jpmorgan chase’s net interest margins to be compressed which could reduce 

 when credit spreads widen it becomes more expensive for jpmorgan chase to borrow jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads 

 

may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to jpmorgan chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads will affect positively or negatively jpmorgan chase’s earnings on certain liabilities such as derivatives that are recorded at fair value 

high market volatility can impact jpmorgan chase’s markets businesses 

while jpmorgan chase’s markets businesses may earn higher flow revenue during periods of elevated market volatility sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities loans derivatives and other instruments can 

 the federal reserve has observed that market volatility may be exacerbated by regulatory restrictions it noted that market participants that are subject to the volcker rule are likely to decrease their marketmaking activities and thereby constrain market liquidity during periods of market stress furthermore market participants that are not required to hold substantial amounts of capital may retreat more quickly from volatile markets which could further reduce market liquidity 

in a difficult or less liquid market environment jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies in these circumstances it may be difficult for jpmorgan chase to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations 

sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence which could lead to lower client activity and reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues 

credit

provide custody services for assets of jpmorgan chase’s clients becomes insolvent 

disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral the disposition of those disputes could cause jpmorgan chase to incur unexpected transaction operational and legal costs or result in credit losses these consequences can also impair jpmorgan chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities 

jpmorgan chase’s markets businesses can be harmed by the insolvency of a significant market participant 

the failure of a significant market participant or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a firm can have a cascading effect within the financial markets jpmorgan chase’s markets businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting 

jpmorgan chase’s clearing services business is exposed to the risk of client or counterparty default 

as part of its clearing services activities jpmorgan chase is a member of various central counterparty clearinghouses “ccps” in the event that another member of such an organization defaults on its obligations to the ccp jpmorgan chase may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the ccp as a result of that default as a clearing member jpmorgan chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral jpmorgan chase is exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management clearing custodial and other transaction services to those clients if a client for which jpmorgan chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent jpmorgan chase may incur losses become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more ccps the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or be subject to regulatory investigations all of the foregoing events can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and litigation costs and jpmorgan chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses 

jpmorgan chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity jpmorgan chase’s credit risk may be further increased when jpmorgan chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to it furthermore disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and jpmorgan chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral 

 

jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk 

jpmorgan chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties 

 for example a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar related or dependent industries this type of interrelationship could exacerbate jpmorgan chase’s credit and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses including fair value losses in its trading businesses 

similarly challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries wherever located these conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive industrywide expansion of consumer credit for example heightened competition among financial institutions for certain types of consumer loans including credit card mortgage auto or other loans could prompt significant reductions in the pricing of those loans and thereby decrease their profitability or result in loans being extended to lesscreditworthy borrowers if large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans whether due to weak credit profiles an economic downturn or other factors this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to jpmorgan chase and result in higher chargeoffs and other creditrelated losses more broadly widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the us economy and jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment 

disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets could cause jpmorgan chase to be unable to sell syndicate or realize the value of its positions in various debt instruments loans derivatives and other obligations and thereby lead to increased risk concentrations if jpmorgan 



chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of riskweighted assets “rwa” that jpmorgan chase holds on its balance sheet these factors could increase jpmorgan chase’s capital requirements and funding costs and adversely affect the profitability of jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

liquidity 

liquidity is critical to jpmorgan chase’s ability to fund and operate its businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as 

 a diminution of jpmorgan chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control for example during the 20082009 financial crisis periods of low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity resulted in higher funding costs for jpmorgan chase and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity including securitized debt issuances there is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur in the future 

jpmorgan chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lowercost sources of funding such as bank deposits and borrowings from federal home loan banks is reduced alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability jpmorgan chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that jpmorgan chase may take in order to 

 more generally if jpmorgan chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and thereby adversely affect its results of operations 

 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities 

jpmorgan chase  co is a holding company that holds the stock of jpmorgan chase bank na and an intermediate holding company jpmorgan chase holdings llc the “ihc” the ihc in turn holds the stock of substantially all of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries other than jpmorgan chase bank na and its subsidiaries the ihc also owns other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to the holding company 

the holding company is obligated to contribute to the ihc substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock 

the ability of jpmorgan chase bank na and the ihc to make payments to the holding company is also limited jpmorgan chase bank na is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company the ihc is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by jpmorgan chase’s management or board of directors 

as a result of these arrangements the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from jpmorgan chase bank na and dividends and extensions of credit from the ihc these limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to 

 collectively these regulatory restrictions and limitations could significantly limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations they could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of those thresholds 

reductions in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies rating agencies evaluate both general and firm and industryspecific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution including 





part i 

 jpmorgan chase closely monitors and manages to the extent that it is able factors that could influence its credit ratings however there is no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future furthermore any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when jpmorgan chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

a reduction in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings could curtail jpmorgan chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways including by 

 any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries this could in turn adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries 

regulation and reform of benchmarks could have adverse consequences on securities and other instruments that are linked to those benchmarks 

interest rate equity foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of recent international national and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented these reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated 

any of the international national or other proposals for reform or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with any such regulations or requirements such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks 

 

on july 27 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 and it appears likely that libor will be discontinued or modified by 2021 

any of the these developments and any future initiatives to regulate reform or change the manner of administration of benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on value of and market for securities and other instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark including those issued by jpmorgan chase or its subsidiaries 

operational 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of jpmorgan chase’s financial accounting trading data processing and other operational systems to process record monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis and to do so accurately and quickly in addition to proper design installation maintenance and training the effective functioning of jpmorgan chase’s operational systems depends on among other things 

 jpmorgan chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors custodians and other market participants including clearing and payment systems ccps securities exchanges and data processing security and technology companies 

the ineffectiveness failure or other disruption of the operational systems of jpmorgan chase or another significant market participant including due to a cyberbreach could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including 





 furthermore the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents ccps payment processors securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures and the increased importance of these entities increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to conduct business 

as the speed frequency volume and complexity of transactions increases it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain jpmorgan chase’s operational systems and infrastructure especially due to the heightened risks that 

 if jpmorgan chase’s operational systems or those of third parties on which jpmorgan chase’s businesses depend are unable to meet the demanding standards of jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings jpmorgan chase could be materially and adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase relies on the skill and integrity of its employees and those of third parties in running its operational systems 

the effective functioning of jpmorgan chase’s operational systems also depends on the competence and reliability of its employees as well as the employees of third parties on whom jpmorgan chase depends for technological support security or other services jpmorgan chase could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure caused by human error or 

 

misconduct by an employee of jpmorgan chase or a third party 

jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with new products or processes 

when jpmorgan chase changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions jpmorgan chase may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with new business activities any of these occurrences could diminish jpmorgan chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in 

 any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s connections to thirdparty operational systems expose it to greater operational risks 

third parties with which jpmorgan chase does business as well as retailers data aggregators and other third parties with which jpmorgan chase’s customers do business can also be sources of operational risk to jpmorgan chase this is particularly the case where activities of customers or those third parties are beyond jpmorgan chase’s security and control systems including through the use of the internet personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services 

if a third party obtains access to customer account data on jpmorgan chase’s systems and that third party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase and its customers including 





part i 

as jpmorgan chase’s interconnectivity with customers and other third parties expands jpmorgan chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems security breaches affecting jpmorgan chase’s customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting those other third parties may require jpmorgan chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information these actions can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction 

jpmorgan chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations both within and outside the us governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals the protected parties can include 

 ensuring that jpmorgan chase’s collection use transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict can 

 furthermore jpmorgan chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and jpmorgan chase particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means jpmorgan chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions if personal confidential or proprietary information of clients customers employees or others were to be mishandled or misused such as situations where such information is 

 concerns regarding the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s measures to safeguard personal information or even the perception that those measures are inadequate could cause 

 

jpmorgan chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers and thereby reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues furthermore any failure or perceived failure by jpmorgan chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices significant liabilities or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions any of these could damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s operations and results could be vulnerable to catastrophes or other events that disrupt its business 

jpmorgan chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted by events that are wholly or partially beyond its control including 

 jpmorgan chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure the ability to recover critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers any significant failure or disruption of jpmorgan chase’s operations or operational systems could among other things 

 a successful cyberattack against jpmorgan chase could cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers 

jpmorgan chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems software networks and other technology assets on a daily basis these cyberattacks can 



take many forms but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into jpmorgan chase’s systems these viruses or malicious code are typically designed to among other things 

 jpmorgan chase has also been the target of significant distributed denialofservice attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services 

jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks however jpmorgan chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers 

a principal reason that jpmorgan chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate detect or recognize threats to jpmorgan chase’s systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches this is because among other things 

 the risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as jpmorgan chase continues to expand its mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and its internal use of webbased products and applications 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems or the systems of a supplier governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences including 



 

 jpmorgan chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by jpmorgan chase’s employees 

jpmorgan chase may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a security breach due to a cyberattack 

a successful breach of jpmorgan chase’s computer systems software networks or other technology assets due to a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to among other things 

 the extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that jpmorgan chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known while such an investigation is ongoing jpmorgan chase may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of which could

further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework and procedures may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework is intended to mitigate risk and loss jpmorgan chase has established processes and procedures to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which jpmorgan chase is subject however there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may be existing or future risks that jpmorgan chase has not appropriately anticipated or identified 

jpmorgan chase could be exposed to unexpected losses and jpmorgan chase’s financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any inadequacy or lapse in its risk management framework governance structure procedures and practices models or reporting systems an inadequacy or lapse could 

 jpmorgan chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices these deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting 

jpmorgan chase establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures it then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to jpmorgan chase’s results of operations and financial condition they require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of jpmorgan chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations it is possible that jpmorgan chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

many of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior these strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by jpmorgan chase are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress including difficult or less liquid market environments or in 

 

the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated conversely previouslycorrelated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase’s risk management strategies causing it to incur losses 

jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses and face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations are inadequate 

jpmorgan chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations to assess and implement mitigating controls over its market credit operational and other risks these models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary the models and estimations that jpmorgan chase uses may not be effective in all cases to observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors such as 

 jpmorgan chase could incur substantial losses its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate 

some of the models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations used by jpmorgan chase in managing risks are subject to review by and require the approval of jpmorgan chase’s regulators these reviews are required before jpmorgan chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk rwa credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under basel iii if jpmorgan chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators it may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses jpmorgan chase’s capital actions could also be constrained if a ccar submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations 



enhanced standards for vendor risk management can result in higher costs and other potential exposures 

jpmorgan chase must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with doing business with vendors and other thirdparty service providers these requirements are contained both in bank regulatory regulations and guidance and in certain consent orders to which jpmorgan chase has been subject jpmorgan chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships jpmorgan chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage thirdparty relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase specifically any such failure could subject jpmorgan chase to 

 requirements for physical settlement and delivery in trading agreements could expose jpmorgan chase to operational and other risks 

certain of jpmorgan chase’s markets transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that jpmorgan chase does not own if jpmorgan chase is unable to obtain the obligations within the required timeframe jpmorgan chase could forfeit payments otherwise due failures could also result in settlement delays which could damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation and ability to transact business failure to timely settle and confirm transactions could also subject jpmorgan chase to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default market and operational losses 

jpmorgan chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” jpmorgan chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation among other items certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare jpmorgan chase’s financial statements including 



 

 where quoted market prices are not available for these types of instruments jpmorgan chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted if estimates or judgments underlying jpmorgan chase’s financial statements prove to have been incorrect jpmorgan chase may experience material losses 

lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s profitability or reputation 

there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur any such lapses or deficiencies could 

 strategic 

if jpmorgan chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies jpmorgan chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer 

  jpmorgan chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and results of operations these strategies relate to 

 the franchise values and growth prospects of jpmorgan chase’s businesses and its earnings and results of operations may suffer and revenues could decline if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that 





part i 

 jpmorgan chase’s growth and prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities both in the near term and over longer time horizons management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources control expenses and return capital to shareholders each of these objectives could be adversely affected by management’s failure to 

 additionally jpmorgan chase’s board of directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of management’s strategic decisions and a failure by the board to perform this function could also impair jpmorgan chase’s results of operations 

conduct 

misconduct by jpmorgan chase employees can harm its clients and customers damage its reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action 

jpmorgan chase’s employees interact with clients customers and counterparties and with each other every day all employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the culture and behaviors that are an integral part of jpmorgan chase’s how we do business principles including jpmorgan chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way” jpmorgan chase endeavors to embed culture and conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle including recruiting onboarding training and development and performance management culture and conduct risk management are 

 

also important to jpmorgan chase’s promotion and compensation processes 

notwithstanding these expectations policies and practices certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct resulting in litigation as well as settlements involving consent orders deferred prosecution agreements and nonprosecution agreements as well as other civil and criminal settlements with regulators and other governmental entities there is no assurance that further inappropriate actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be deterred or quickly prevented 

jpmorgan chase’s reputation could be harmed and collateral consequences could result from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with jpmorgan chase’s expectations including by acting in ways that harm clients customers other market participants or other employees some examples of this include 

 the consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with jpmorgan chase’s expectations could include litigation or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other sanctions or lead to 





 reputation 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could harm its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients customers investors and employees damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase’s business and prospects harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including 

 jpmorgan chase’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of certain third parties to comply with laws or regulations including companies in which jpmorgan chase has made principal investments parties to joint ventures with jpmorgan chase and vendors and other third parties with which jpmorgan chase does business 

jpmorgan chase’s reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding jpmorgan chase whether or not true that may be posted on social media nonmainstream news services or other parts of the internet and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels 

actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect jpmorgan chase’s reputation for example concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole if jpmorgan chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors the measures needed to address the associated reputational issues could increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and compliance costs and negatively affect its earnings furthermore events that undermine jpmorgan chase’s reputation can hinder its ability to attract and retain clients customers investors and employees 

failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions as well as damage jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as its business activities encompass more transactions obligations and 

 

interests with and among jpmorgan chase’s clients and customers jpmorgan chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions and its reputation can be damaged by the failure or perceived failure to among other things 

 in the future a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to jpmorgan chase’s reputation 

country 

jpmorgan chase can incur losses due to unfavorable economic developments around the world 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the monetary fiscal and other policies adopted by various us and nonus regulatory authorities and agencies for example the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the us and the return earned on those loans and investments changes in fiscal policies by central banks or regulatory authorities and the manner in which those policies are executed are beyond jpmorgan chase’s control and may be difficult to predict consequently unanticipated changes in these policies or the ways in which they are implemented could have a negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and revenues are also subject to the risks inherent in investing and marketmaking in securities loans and other obligations of companies worldwide these risks include among others 





part i 

adverse economic and political developments in a country or region can have a wider negative impact on jpmorgan chase’s businesses 

some countries or regions in which jpmorgan chase operates or invests or in which jpmorgan chase may do business in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions in some cases concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced commercial activity among trading partners within the affected countries or region these developments can also create market volatility which can lead to a contagion affecting other countries in the same region or beyond furthermore governments in particular countries or regions in which jpmorgan chase or its clients do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions any or all of these developments could lead to diminished crossborder trade and financing activity within that country or region all of which could negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s business and earnings in those jurisdictions if jpmorgan chase takes steps to reduce its market and credit risk exposure within a particular country or region that is experiencing economic or political disruption it may incur losses that are higher than expected because it will be disposing of assets when market conditions are likely to be highly unfavorable 

jpmorgan chase’s business activities with governmental entities pose a greater risk of loss 

several of jpmorgan chase’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities both within and outside the us these activities can expose jpmorgan chase to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputation risks including the risks that a governmental entity may 

 any or all of these actions could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation particularly if jpmorgan chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers 

jpmorgan chase’s business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local political social and economic factors 

some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable 

 

than the us and other developed markets in which jpmorgan chase operates some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including 

 the governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment in addition these countries as well as certain more developed countries have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions including 

 these economic political and social developments have in the past resulted in and in the future could lead to conditions that can adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues growth and profitability of those operations 

if the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less established or predictable this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business for example any of the following could hamper jpmorgan chase’s operations and reduce its earnings in countries with less established or predictable legal and regulatory regimes 





 jpmorgan chase’s operations in or involving emerging markets countries can also be affected by governmental actions such as 

 the impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller less liquid and more volatile than moredeveloped markets these types of government actions can negatively affect jpmorgan chase’s operations in the relevant country either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multinational clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction for example some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to jpmorgan chase or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client being effectively trapped in a country in addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely jpmorgan chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy 

jpmorgan chase’s revenues from international operations and trading in nonus securities and other obligations can be negatively affected by the foregoing economic political and social conditions in a particular country in which it does business in addition any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can affect jpmorgan chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries including in the us 

jpmorgan chase’s operations in the emerging markets can subject it to higher operational and compliance costs 

conducting business in countries with lessdeveloped legal and regulatory regimes often requires jpmorgan chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that jpmorgan chase will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators 

complying with economic sanctions and anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations can increase jpmorgan chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks 

 

jpmorgan chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by ofac and similar national and multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside the us as well as anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations throughout the world jpmorgan chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements furthermore a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anticorruption or antimoney laundering laws and regulations could subject jpmorgan chase and individual employees to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties

the financial services industry is highly competitive and jpmorgan chase’s results of operations will suffer if it is not a strong and effective competitor 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects that competition in the us and global financial services industry will continue to be intense competitors include 

 jpmorgan chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations 

new competitors have emerged for example technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products these advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading payment processing and online automated algorithmicbased investment advice furthermore both financial institutions and their nonbanking competitors face the risk that payment processing and other services could be disrupted by technologies such as cryptocurrencies that require no intermediation new technologies have required and could require jpmorgan chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors including technology companies 

ongoing or increased competition may put downward pressure on prices and fees for jpmorgan chase’s products and services or may cause jpmorgan chase to lose market share this competition may be on the basis of among other factors quality and variety of products and services offered transaction execution innovation reputation and price the failure of any of jpmorgan chase’s businesses to 



part i 

meet the expectations of clients and customers whether due to general market conditions or underperformance could affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers any such impact could in turn reduce jpmorgan chase’s revenues increased competition also may require jpmorgan chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive 

nonus competitors of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses outside the us are typically subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes the more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to jpmorgan chase and other us financial services institutions can put jpmorgan chase and those firms at a competitive disadvantage to nonus competitors this could reduce the revenue and profitability of jpmorgan chase’s wholesale businesses resulting from 

 people 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are its most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense jpmorgan chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees if jpmorgan chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees including successors to the chief executive officer or members of the operating committee jpmorgan chase’s performance including its competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 

changes in immigration policies could adversely affect jpmorgan chase 

there is the potential for changes in immigration policies in multiple jurisdictions around the world including in the us if immigration policies were to unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase has operations or conducts its business jpmorgan chase could be adversely affected 

 

legal 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory investigations 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties actions currently pending against jpmorgan chase may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to jpmorgan chase any of these matters could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that jpmorgan chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations 

regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams and jpmorgan chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight this heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of such an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions there is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against jpmorgan chase furthermore a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the us or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in nonus jurisdictions 

if another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by jpmorgan chase 

these and other initiatives by us and nonus governmental authorities may subject jpmorgan chase to judgments settlements fines or penalties or require jpmorgan chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of these potential outcomes could harm jpmorgan chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs thereby reducing jpmorgan chase’s profitability or result in collateral consequences

 item 9a controls and procedures 

the internal control framework promulgated by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” “internal control — integrated framework” “coso 2013” provides guidance for designing implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness the firm used the coso 2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017  see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 146  

as of the end of the period covered by this report an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the firm’s management including its chairman and chief executive officer and its chief financial officer of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on that evaluation the chairman and chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective see exhibits 311 and 312 for the certifications issued by the chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer 

the firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting nevertheless because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future for further information see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 146  there was no change in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the three months ended   december 31 2017  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the firm’s internal control over financial reporting

competition 

jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks hedge funds commodity trading companies private equity firms insurance companies mutual fund companies investment managers credit card companies mortgage banking companies trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies financial technology companies and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services the firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the firm’s products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price competition also varies based on the types of clients customers industries and geographies served with respect to some of its geographies and products jpmorgan chase competes globally with respect to others the firm competes on a national or regional basis the firm’s ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel and on its reputation 

it is likely that competition in the financial services industry will become even more intense as the firm’s businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the firm or with companies that provide new or innovative products or services that the firm does not provide 

supervision and regulation 

the firm is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the us as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the us in which  the firm does business   

as a result of regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in the us and abroad  the firm has been experiencing a period of significant change in regulation which has had and could continue to have significant consequences for how  the firm conducts business  the firm continues to work diligently in assessing the regulatory changes it is facing and is devoting substantial resources to comply with all the new regulations while at the same time endeavoring to best meet the needs and expectations of its customers clients and shareholders these efforts include the implementation of new policies procedures and controls and appropriate adjustments to  the firm’s business and operations legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management the combined effect of numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such

rules present challenges and risks to  the firm’s business and operations given the current status of the regulatory developments  the firm cannot currently quantify all of the possible effects on its business and operations of the significant changes that are underway  for more information see risk factors on pages 8–21

holding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements including requirements that the  financial holding company and each of its us depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged”   the federal reserve may also impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may for example require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies persist federal regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies in addition a financial holding company must obtain federal reserve approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the us and internationally as further described under regulation of acquisitions below

capital and liquidity requirements the federal reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for  the firm and evaluates its compliance with such requirements the occ establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for  the firm’s national banking subsidiaries for more information about the applicable requirements relating to riskbased capital and leverage in the us under the most recent capital framework established by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee”“basel iii”  see capital risk management on pages 76–85   and note 28  under basel iii bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the us banking regulators have approved the final lcr rule “us lcr” which became effective on january 1 2015 in april 2016 the us banking regulators issued a proposed rule for nsfr  for additional information on these ratios see liquidity risk management on pages 110–115  on december 19 2016 the federal reserve published final 



us lcr public disclosure requirements starting with the second quarter of 2017  the firm will be required to disclose quarterly its consolidated lcr pursuant to the us lcr rule including  the firm’s average lcr for the quarter and the key quantitative components of the average lcr in a standardized template along with a qualitative discussion of material drivers of the ratio changes over time and causes of such changes on september 8 2016 the federal reserve published the framework that will apply to the setting of the countercyclical capital buffer as of october 24 2016 the federal reserve reaffirmed setting the us countercyclical capital buffer at 0 and stated that it will review the amount at least annually   banking supervisors continue to consider refinements and enhancements to the basel iii capital framework for financial institutions the basel committee finalized revisions to market risk capital for trading books and the treatment of interest rate risk in the banking book other proposals being contemplated by the basel committee include revisions to among others   standardized credit and operational risk capital frameworks  a recalibration of the leverage ratio revisions to the securitization framework and changes to the definition of defaulted assets in january 2017 the basel committee announced that the review of the proposals to finalize the postcrisis regulatory reforms has been postponed after a proposal is finalized by the basel committee us banking regulators would then need to propose requirements applicable to us financial institutions   in march 2016 the federal reserve board released a revised proposal to establish singlecounterparty credit limits for large us bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations   

stress tests  the federal reserve has adopted supervisory stress tests for large bank holding companies including jpmorgan chase which form part of the federal reserve’s annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” framework under the framework  the firm must conduct semiannual companyrun stress tests and in addition must submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by  the firm and the federal reserve in reviewing  the firm’s capital plan the federal reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors qualitative assessments include among other things the comprehensiveness of the plan the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan and the extent to which  the firm has satisfied certain supervisory matters related to  the firm’s processes and analyses including the design and operational effectiveness of the controls governing such processes moreover  the firm is required to receive a notice of nonobjection from the federal reserve before taking capital actions such as paying dividends implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the occ requires jpmorgan chase bank na to perform separate similar annual stress tests  the firm publishes each year the results of its midcycle stress tests under  the firm’s internallydeveloped “severely adverse” scenario and the results of its 

 

and its two primary subsidiary banks’ annual stress tests under the supervisory “severely adverse” scenarios provided by the federal reserve and the occ  the firm will file its 2017 annual ccar submission on april 5 results will be published by the federal reserve by june 30 with disclosures of results by bhcs including  the firm to follow within 15 days the midcycle capital stress test submissions are due on october 5 and bhcs including  the firm  will publish results by november 4   for additional information on the firm’s ccar see capital risk management on pages 76–85  

enhanced prudential standards the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” among other things recommends prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements to the federal reserve for systemically important financial institutions “sifis” such as jpmorgan chase the federal reserve has adopted several rules to implement the heightened prudential standards including final rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject bhcs bhcs with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards and their boards of directors are required to conduct appropriate oversight of their risk management activities  for information on liquidity measures see liquidity risk management on pages 110–115  several additional proposed rules are still being considered including an “early remediation” framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses   

orderly liquidation authority and resolution and recovery  as a bhc with assets of 50 billion or more  the firm is required to submit annually to the federal reserve and the fdic a plan for resolution under the bankruptcy code in the event of material distress or failure a “resolution plan” the fdic also requires each insured depository institution with 50 billion or more in assets  such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na to provide a resolution plan  for more information about the firm’s resolution plan see risk factors on pages 8–21  as well as business overview on pages 37–38  for information regarding the firm’s 2016 resolution submission in addition certain financial companies including jpmorgan chase and certain of its subsidiaries can be subjected to resolution under an “orderly liquidation authority” the us treasury secretary in consultation with the president of the united states must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations and action must be recommended by the fdic and the federal reserve absent such actions  the firm  as a bhc would remain subject to resolution under the bankruptcy code in december 2013 the fdic issued a draft policy statement describing its “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of systemically important financial institutions under the orderly liquidation authority this strategy seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of the bhc open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the holding company in

receivership according to their statutory order of priority  for further information see risk factors on pages 8–21  

the firm has a comprehensive recovery plan detailing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining wellcapitalized and wellfunded in the case of an adverse event jpmorgan chase has provided the federal reserve with comprehensive confidential supervisory information and analyses about  the firm’s businesses legal entities and corporate governance and about its crisis management governance capabilities and available alternatives to raise liquidity and capital in severe market circumstances the occ has published guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks and jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na have submitted their recovery plans to the occ  for further information see risk factors on pages 8–21  in addition certain of  the firm’s nonus subsidiaries are subject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate   

regulators in the us and abroad continue to be focused on developing measures designed to address the possibility or perception that large financial institutions including  the firm may be “too big to fail” and to provide safeguards so that if a large financial institution does fail it can be resolved without the use of public funds higher capital surcharges on  global systemically important banks “gsibs” requirements for certain large bank holding companies to maintain a minimum amount of longterm debt to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms and the international swaps and derivatives association “isda” protocol relating to the “closeout” of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large crossborder financial institution are examples of initiatives to address “too big to fail”   for further information  on the gsib framework and total loss absorbing capacity “tlac” see capital risk management on pages 76–85  and risk factors on pages 8–21  and on the isda closeout protocol see derivatives regulation below   

holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries  jpmorgan chase  co is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when  the firm might otherwise determine not to provide it   

regulation of acquisitions acquisitions by bank holding companies and their banks are subject to multiple requirements by the federal reserve and the occ for example financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank in addition acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if as a result of the acquisition the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10 of the total liabilities of all financial companies in addition for certain acquisitions  the firm must provide written notice to the federal reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of 

 

any voting shares of any company with over 10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in nature” 

jpmorgan chase’s subsidiary banks   

the firm’s two primary subsidiary banks jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are fdicinsured national banks regulated by the occ as national banks the activities of jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are limited to those specifically authorized under the national bank act and related interpretations by the occ 

fdic deposit insurance  the fdic deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na changes in the methodology used to calculate such assessments resulting from the enactment of the doddfrank act significantly increased the assessments that  the firm’s bank subsidiaries pay annually to the fdic the fdic instituted a new assessment surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets greater than 10 billion in order to raise the reserve ratio for the fdic deposit insurance fund future fdic rulemaking could further increase such assessments   

fdic powers upon a bank insolvency  upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution such as jpmorgan chase bank na the fdic could be appointed as the conservator or receiver under the federal deposit insurance act “fdia”   the fdic has broad powers to transfer any assets and liabilities without the approval of the institution’s creditors  for further information on the impact to creditors see risk factors on pages 8–21  

crossguarantee an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic if another fdicinsured institution that is under common control with such institution is in default or is deemed to be “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution   

prompt corrective action and early remediation  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent bhc such as jpmorgan chase  co based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary in certain instances the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary   



occ heightened standards  the occ has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks while the bank can use certain components of the parent company’s risk governance framework the framework must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management purposes the bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for approving the bank’s risk governance framework providing active oversight of the bank’s risktaking activities and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework 

restrictions on transactions with affiliates the bank subsidiaries of  jpmorgan chase including subsidiaries of those banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to investments in stock or securities of and derivatives securities lending and certain other transactions with jpmorgan chase  co and certain other affiliates these restrictions prevent jpmorgan chase  co and other affiliates from borrowing from  such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements for more information see note  27 in addition the volcker rule imposes a prohibition on such transactions between any jpmorgan chase entity and covered funds for which a jpmorgan chase entity serves as the investment manager investment advisor commodity trading advisor or sponsor as well as subject to a limited exception any covered fund controlled by such funds

significant international regulatory initiatives   

in the eu there is an extensive and complex program of final and proposed regulatory enhancement that reflects in part the eu’s commitments to policies of the group of twenty finance ministers and central bank governors “g20” together with other plans specific to the eu the eu operates a european systemic risk board that monitors financial stability together with european supervisory agencies that set detailed regulatory rules and encourage supervisory convergence across the 28 member states the eu has also created a single supervisory mechanism for the eurozone under which the regulation of all banks in that zone will be under the auspices of the european central bank together with a single resolution mechanism and single resolution board having jurisdiction over bank resolution in the zone at both the g20 and eu levels various proposals are under consideration to address risks associated with global financial institutions some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries   

guided by the g20 policy framework the eu and national financial regulators have proposed or adopted several market reforms including emir which requires among other things the central clearing of standardized derivatives and mifid ii which gives effect to the g20 commitment to trading of derivatives through central clearing houses and exchanges and also includes significantly enhanced requirements for pre and posttrade transparency and a significant reconfiguration of the regulatory supervision of execution venues key aspects of emir and mifid ii have been finalized although the implementation date of mifid ii has been delayed to 2018 

the eu is also currently considering or implementing significant revisions to laws covering depositary activities creditrating activities resolution of banks investment firms and market infrastructures antimoney laundering controls data security and privacy corporate governance in financial firms and implementation in the eu of the basel iii capital and liquidity standards including the introduction of 



part i 

an intermediate holding company requirement for foreign banks and the implementation of the standard for tlac   

the eu is also considering proposed legislation providing for a proprietary trading ban and mandatory separation of other trading activities within certain banks various eu member states have separately enacted similar measures in the uk legislation was adopted that mandates the separation or “ringfencing” of deposittaking activities from securities trading and other analogous activities within banks subject to certain exemptions the legislation includes the supplemental recommendation of the parliamentary commission on banking standards the “tyrie commission” that such ringfences should be “electrified” by the imposition of mandatory forced separation on banking institutions that are deemed to test the limits of the safeguards parallel but distinct provisions have been enacted by the french and german governments these measures may separately or taken together have significant implications for  the firm’s organizational structure in europe as well as its permitted activities and capital deployment in the eu   

much of the g20 policy framework has been finalized however the basel committee is currently reviewing the framework and proposing recalibrations of certain requirements as such the eu is considering or implementing significant revisions to laws covering bank and investment firm recovery and resolution bank structure securities settlement transparency and disclosure of securities financing transactions benchmarks resolution of market infrastructures central counterparties “ccps” antimoney laundering controls data security and privacy and corporate governance in financial firms together with new amendments to capital and liquidity standards   

consistent with the g20 and eu policy frameworks uk regulators have adopted a range of policy measures that have significantly changed the markets and prudential regulatory environment in the uk in addition to broad recommendations made by the fair and effective markets review which focused on fixed income currencies and commodities markets uk regulators are considering measures to raise standards and accountability of individuals and promote forwardlooking conduct risk identification and mitigation including by introducing the new senior managers and certification regimes 

on june 23 2016 the uk voted by referendum to leave the european union “brexit” the uk government has since announced that it will invoke article 50 of the lisbon treaty and will start the formal exit negotiations by the end of march 2017 giving an expected exit date of the end of march 2019 more recently the british prime minister   laid out twelve “negotiation objectives” for brexit which confirmed the uk will not remain a member of the single market but will pursue a free trade agreement that provides the greatest possible access to the single market further the uk government will seek a phased arrangement to ensure the orderly transition of the legal 

 

and regulatory framework for financial services and promote stability and market confidence following a recent ruling by the uk supreme court the house of commons approved legislation on february 8 2017 that allows the british prime minister to invoke article 50 the legislation must now be approved by the house of lords before it is signed into law   

many international banks including  the firm operate substantial parts of their european union businesses from entities based in the uk upon the uk leaving the european union the regulatory and legal environment that would then exist and to which  the firm’s uk operations would then be subject will depend on in certain respects the nature of the arrangements the uk agreed with the european union and other trading partners these arrangements cannot be predicted but currently  the firm does not believe any of the likely identified scenarios would threaten the viability of  the firm’s business units or  the firm’s ability to serve clients across the european union and in the uk however it is possible that under some scenarios changes to  the firm’s legal entity structure and operations would be required which might result in a less efficient operating model across  the firm’s european legal entities   

the firm is in the process of evaluating plans to ensure its continued ability to operate in the uk and the eu beyond the expected exit date   




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chase ’s financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm 

regulatory risk 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and the firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the firm is subject 

as a global financial services firm jpmorgan chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the us and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the us in which the firm does business the financial services industry has in recent years experienced an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision both in the us and globally the cumulative effect of the new and currently proposed legislation and regulations could require the firm to make further changes to its businesses or operations which could result in a significant loss of revenue for the firm and impose additional compliance and other costs on the firm or otherwise reduce the firm’s profitability these changes could also limit the products and services that the firm offers reduce the liquidity that the firm is able to offer its clients or counterparties through its marketmaking activities impede the firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging require the firm to dispose of or curtail certain 



businesses affect the value of assets that the firm holds require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products or otherwise adversely affect the firm’s businesses to the extent that these initiatives have been or continue to be imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions based on size activities geography or other criteria the requirements to which the firm may be subject under such laws and regulations could require the firm to restructure further its businesses or further reprice or curtail the products or services that it offers to customers which could result in the firm not being able to compete effectively with other institutions that are not impacted in the same way 

authorities in some nonus jurisdictions in which the firm has operations have enacted legislation or regulations requiring that certain subsidiaries of the firm operating in those countries maintain independent capital and liquidity in addition some nonus regulators have proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries these requirements and any future laws or regulations that seek to impose restrictions on the way the firm organizes its business units or increase the capital or liquidity requirements on nonus subsidiaries of the firm could hinder the firm’s ability to efficiently manage its operations increase its funding and liquidity costs and thereby decrease the firm’s net income in addition there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the us and in different countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example recent legislative and regulatory initiatives within the eu including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions the establishment by noneu financial institutions of intermediate holding companies in the eu the separation of trading activities from core banking services mandatory onexchange trading position limits and reporting rules for derivatives governance and accountability regimes conduct of business requirements and restrictions on compensation could require the firm to make significant modifications to its nonus business operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements these differences in implemented or proposed nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the us which could subject the firm to increased compliance and legal costs as well as higher operational capital and liquidity costs all of which could have an adverse effect on the firm’s business results of operations and profitability 

recent political developments in the us and abroad have increased the uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment in which the firm will operate although certain of the proposals being mentioned in the us include the possibility of regulatory reform related to the financial services industry it is too early to determine the full extent to which these measures will ultimately modify or reduce the regulatory requirements currently imposed on the firm and the resulting possible effect on the firm and its business and operations in addition the uk’s planned 

 

departure from the eu has engendered significant uncertainty concerning the regulatory framework under which global financial services institutions including jpmorgan chase will need to conduct their business and operations in the eu after the uk’s departure 

expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of jpmorgan chase’s businesses may continue to increase the firm’s costs and risks 

the firm’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny the firm has paid significant fines or has provided significant monetary and other relief to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies the firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject which increases the firm’s operational and compliance costs 

certain regulators have taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions against financial institutions including the firm that require admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters such admissions and conditions can lead to among other things greater exposure in civil litigation harm to reputation disqualification from providing business to certain clients and in certain jurisdictions and other direct and indirect adverse effects 

in addition us government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions including the firm and have increasingly sought and obtained resolutions that include criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing from those institutions such as the firm’s agreement in may 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities and the nonprosecution agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the firm with the us department of justice in november 2016 in connection with settlements to resolve various governmental investigations relating to a former hiring program for candidates referred by clients potential clients and government officials in the asia pacific region such resolutions whether with us or nonus authorities could have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution including loss of customers and business or the inability to offer certain products or services or losing permission to operate certain businesses for a period of time absent the forbearance of or the granting of waivers by applicable regulators 

the firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than with informal supervisory action in addition if the firm fails to meet the requirements of the various governmental settlements to which it is subject or more 



part i 

generally to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements pay additional fines penalties or judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses the extent of the firm’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could in some cases substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the firm has established for such matters 

requirements for the orderly resolution of the firm could require jpmorgan chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses 

under title i of the doddfrank act “title i” and federal reserve and fdic rules the firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the federal reserve and the fdic a detailed plan the “resolution plan” for the rapid and orderly resolution without extraordinary government support of jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its subsidiaries under the us bankruptcy code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress of the firm 

in april 2016 the federal reserve and the fdic jointly provided firmspecific feedback on the 2015 resolution plans of eight systemically important domestic banking institutions and determined that five of these 2015 resolution plans including that of the firm were not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code in addition to the identified deficiencies the federal reserve and the fdic also identified certain shortcomings which were required to be satisfactorily addressed in the firm’s resolution plan due on july 1 2017 on october 1 2016 the firm filed with the federal reserve and the fdic its submission the “2016 resolution submission” describing how the firm remediated the identified deficiencies and providing a status report of its actions to address the identified shortcomings 

on december 13 2016 the federal reserve and the fdic advised the firm of their determinations that the firm’s 2016 resolution submission adequately remediated the deficiencies in the firm’s 2015 resolution plan identified by the agencies on july 1 2017 the firm will file with the federal reserve and the fdic its 2017 resolution plan which will among other things describe how the firm has remediated the remaining shortcomings identified by the agencies in april 2016 if the federal reserve and the fdic were to jointly determine that the firm did not remediate the identified shortcomings or that the firm’s 2017 resolution plan or any future update of that plan is not credible and the firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements on the firm or restrictions on growth activities or operations of the firm and could if such deficiencies are not remedied within two years after such a determination require the firm to restructure reorganize or divest businesses legal entities operational systems andor intercompany transactions in ways that could 

 

materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations and strategy in addition in order to continue to maintain a title i resolution plan that the federal reserve and fdic determine is credible the firm may need to make additional changes to its legal entity structure and to certain intercompany and external activities which could result in increased funding or operational costs 

holders of jpmorgan chase’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if jpmorgan chase were to enter into a resolution 

the federal reserve has issued final rules the “tlac rules” regarding the minimum levels of unsecured external longterm debt and other lossabsorbing capacity that bank holding companies are required to have issued and outstanding as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalizing the firm’s operating subsidiaries “eligible ltd” if jpmorgan chase  co were to enter into a resolution either in a proceeding under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code or in a receivership administered by the fdic under title ii of the doddfrank act holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the firm will absorb the losses of jpmorgan chase  co and its affiliates 

under the firm’s resolution plan the firm’s preferred resolution strategy contemplates that only jpmorgan chase  co would enter bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code pursuant to a “single point of entry” recapitalization strategy jpmorgan chase  co’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be wound down in an orderly manner as a result jpmorgan chase  co’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of jpmorgan chase  co’s equity securities and thereafter on unsecured creditors including holders of jpmorgan chase  co’s eligible ltd and other debt securities claims of holders of those debt securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of jpmorgan chase  co’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority as determined by statute and secured creditors of jpmorgan chase  co accordingly in a resolution of jpmorgan chase  co under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of jpmorgan chase  co would realize value only to the extent available to jpmorgan chase  co as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank na and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of jpmorgan chase  co have been fully repaid if jpmorgan chase  co were to enter into a resolution none of jpmorgan chase  co the federal reserve or the fdic is obligated to follow the firm’s preferred resolution strategy under its resolution plan 

the fdic has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution such as jpmorgan chase  co under title ii of the doddfrank act pursuant to that strategy the fdic would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for jpmorgan chase  co 



transfer the systemically important and viable parts of its business principally the stock of jpmorgan chase  co’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries to the bridge entity recapitalize those subsidiaries using assets of jpmorgan chase  co that have been transferred to the bridge entity and exchange external debt claims against jpmorgan chase  co for equity in the bridge entity under this title ii resolution strategy the value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of jpmorgan chase  co may not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such securities to date the fdic has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy and it is not obligated to follow such a strategy in a title ii resolution of jpmorgan chase  co 

market risk 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by us and global financial market and economic conditions and political developments 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions including the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates currency and commodities prices including oil prices and other market indices investor consumer and business sentiment events that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit the economic effects of natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics severe weather conditions outbreaks of hostilities terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities monetary policies and actions taken by the federal reserve and other central banks and the health of the us and global economies 

recent political developments in the us and abroad have increased the uncertainty regarding the economic environment in which the firm will operate although certain of the proposals being considered in the us such as tax reform or increased expenditure on infrastructure projects could lead to higher levels of us economic activity and more expansive us domestic economic growth others such as protectionist trade policies or isolationist foreign policies could contract economic growth the uncertainty around the manner and extent to which these economic policies are ultimately enacted could impact market volatility and affect the firm’s businesses both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the firm’s clients and customers in addition the effects of various referenda in europe including the vote by the uk electorate to leave the eu as well as the uncertainties regarding the outcome of eurozone presidential elections in 2017 have triggered political and economic uncertainty in the eurozone there is no assurance that such uncertainty and any resultant market volatility will not adversely affect the firm’s results of operations 

in the firm’s wholesale businesses market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that the firm 

 

executes for its clients and therefore the revenue that the firm receives as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the firm 

the firm generally maintains marketmaking positions in the fixed income currency commodities credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients the revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors including the firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets interest rate and credit spreads and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions political events and regulatory restrictions on marketmaking activities in addition the firm’s marketmaking businesses can expose the firm to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause the firm to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not having been appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a financial instrument 

the firm may be adversely affected by declining asset values this is particularly true for businesses that earn fees for managing thirdparty assets or receive or post collateral for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that the firm manages or holds in custody which in turn could affect the firm’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody macroeconomic or market concerns as well as legislative and regulatory developments such as for example the recentlyadopted sec rules relating to moneymarket funds may also prompt outflows from the firm’s funds or accounts or cause clients to invest funds in products that generate lower revenue 

changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the firm earns from net interest income an increasing or high interest rate environment while generally increasing the net interest income earned by the firm may under certain circumstances also result in lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the investment securities portfolio to the extent that the firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higheryielding assets thereby adversely affecting the firm’s revenues and capital levels conversely a low interest rate environment may compress net interest margins reducing the amounts that the firm earns on its investment securities portfolio or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights “msrs” asset thereby reducing the firm’s net interest income and other revenues 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by us domestic economic conditions including us interest 



part i 

rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies sustained low growth in the us economy could diminish demand for the products and services offered by the firm’s consumer businesses or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as economic dislocations in certain geographies due to high levels of unemployment resulting from declining industrial or manufacturing activity or other market or economic factors could lead to an increase in mortgage credit card auto student and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce the firm’s earnings the firm’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by changes in government policies that affect consumers including those relating to medical insurance immigration employment status and taxation as well as governmental policies aimed at the economy more broadly such as infrastructure spending and global trade which could result in among other things higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income 

widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis and may adversely affect the credit markets and the firm’s businesses credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to firmspecific events and circumstances but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in the firm’s credit spreads will impact positively or negatively the firm’s earnings on certain liabilities that are recorded at fair value 

sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets including loans and derivatives may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets adversely affect the firm’s profitability capital or liquidity or increase the firm’s funding costs the federal reserve has recently observed that market volatility may be exacerbated by regulatory restrictions as market participants that are subject to the volcker rule are likely to decrease their marketmaking activities and thereby constrain market liquidity during periods of market stress in addition in a difficult or less liquid market environment the firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for the firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants or widespread market dislocations sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence which could lead to lower client activity and decreased revenue for the firm 

 

credit risk 

the financial condition of jpmorgan chase’s clients and counterparties particularly other financial institutions could adversely affect the firm 

the firm routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds investment managers and other types of financial institutions many of these transactions expose the firm to the credit risk of its counterparties and in some cases disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client disputes with counterparties may also arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts including with respect to the value of underlying collateral which could cause the firm to incur unexpected costs including transaction operational legal and litigation costs or result in credit losses all of which may impair the firm’s ability to manage effectively its credit risk exposure from these products 

the failure of a significant market participant or concerns about a default by such an institution could also lead to significant liquidity problems for or losses or defaults by other institutions which in turn could adversely affect the firm in addition in recent years the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated antitrust or anticompetition laws by colluding to manipulate markets prices or indices and there is no assurance that such allegations will not arise in the same or similar contexts in the future 

as part of providing clearing services the firm is a member of a number of ccps and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members as a clearing member the firm is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral in addition the firm can be exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management clearing custodial and other transaction services to such clients if a client for which the firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent the firm may suffer losses become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties including one or more ccps or the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations all of such events can increase the firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the firm is insufficient to cover such losses 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity the firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to the firm further disputes with obligors concerning the valuation of collateral could increase in 



times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and the firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral 

concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses 

jpmorgan chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when clients or counterparties are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions for example a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the firm’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other borrowers or counterparties in similar related or dependent industries and thereby could exacerbate the firm’s credit risk exposure and potentially increase its losses including marktomarket losses in its trading businesses similarly challenging economic conditions affecting a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of the firm’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries wherever located or about the ability of customers of the firm’s consumer businesses living in such areas or working in such affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to the firm although the firm regularly monitors various segments of its exposures to assess potential concentration or contagion risks the firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against concentration risks may not be successful 

in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the firm’s inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of its positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce the firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but may also increase the level of riskweighted assets “rwa” on the firm’s balance sheet thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the firm’s businesses 

liquidity risk 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses some potential conditions that could impair the firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption unforeseen cash or capital requirements including among others commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets default by a ccp or other counterparty unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in the firm or financial markets in general these conditions may be caused by events over which the firm has little or no control the widespread crisis in investor confidence and 

 

resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages credit card receivables and other assets during that time and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future 

if the firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding such as bank deposits is reduced the firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability in addition the firm’s cost of funding could be affected by actions that the firm may take in order to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements to lower its gsib systemic risk score to satisfy the amount of eligible ltd that the firm must have outstanding under the tlac rules to address obligations under the firm’s resolution plan or to satisfy regulatory requirements in nonus jurisdictions relating to the prepositioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities 

jpmorgan chase is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to fund payments of dividends on its equity securities principal and interest payments on its debt securities and redemptions and repurchases of its outstanding securities 

as a holding company jpmorgan chase  co is dependent on the earnings of its subsidiaries to meet its payment obligations under the arrangements contemplated by the firm’s resolution plan jpmorgan chase  co has established a new intermediate holding company jpmorgan chase holdings llc the “ihc” and has contributed to the ihc the stock of substantially all of its direct subsidiaries other than jpmorgan chase bank na as well as other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to it under these arrangements jpmorgan chase  co is obligated to contribute to the ihc substantially all the net proceeds received by it from securities issuances including without limitation issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock as a result of these arrangements jpmorgan chase  co’s ability to pay interest on its debt securities and dividends on its equity securities to redeem or repurchase its outstanding securities and to fulfill its other payment obligations is dependent on it receiving dividends from jpmorgan chase bank na and dividends and extensions of credit from the ihc jpmorgan chase bank na is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions capital adequacy and liquidity coverage requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to jpmorgan chase  co and the ihc is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to jpmorgan chase  co if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the firm’s management or board of directors these regulatory restrictions and limitations on the payments that jpmorgan chase  co is permitted to receive from jpmorgan chase bank na and the ihc could reduce or hinder its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations or result in jpmorgan chase  co seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than 



part i 

would have been the case absent the existence of such thresholds 

reductions in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the firm 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies rating agencies evaluate both general and firm and industryspecific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution including economic and geopolitical trends regulatory developments future profitability risk management practices legal expenses assumptions surrounding government support and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and nonbank subsidiaries although the firm closely monitors and manages to the extent it is able factors that could influence its credit ratings there is no assurance that the firm’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

furthermore a reduction in the firm’s credit ratings could reduce the firm’s access to capital markets materially increase the cost of issuing securities trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted contractually or otherwise to do business with or lend to the firm thereby curtailing the firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability in addition any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries and as a result could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future 

legal risk 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties actions currently pending against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm which could materially and adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious harm to the firm’s reputation as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that the firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations 

in addition and as noted above the firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions regulators and other government agencies examine the operations of the firm and its subsidiaries on both a routine and targetedexam basis and there is no assurance 

 

that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the firm in the future a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by the firm for example various regulatory and governmental agencies have made inquiries to the firm about its sales practices with retail customers including among other matters the firm’s incentive compensation structures related to such practices in addition a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the us or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in nonus jurisdictions these and other initiatives from us and nonus governmental authorities and officials may subject the firm to further judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause the firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of which could harm the firm’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs thereby reducing the firm’s profitability or result in collateral consequences as discussed above 

other business risks 

any significant failure by the firm’s management to anticipate and respond quickly and appropriately to changes in the firm’s operating environment or trends affecting the financial services industry to make prudent decisions regarding the firm’s strategy or to execute on that strategy could adversely affect the firm’s competitive standing and its earnings and future results of operations 

the firm operates in many jurisdictions and offers a wide variety of products and services to its clients and customers the firm’s strategies concerning the products and services that it will offer the geographies in which it will operate the types of clients and customers that it will serve and the counterparties with which it will do business and the methods and distribution channels by which it will offer its products and services will all affect the firm’s competitive standing and its results of operations if the firm’s management makes choices about the firm’s business strategies and goals that later prove to have been incorrect does not accurately assess the competitive landscape and the industry trends affecting the firm or does not formulate effective business plans to address the firm’s near and longerterm strategic priorities as well as the changing regulatory and market environments in which the firm operates both in the us and abroad the franchise values and growth prospects of the firm’s businesses will suffer and revenues will decline the prospects of the firm will also depend on management’s ability to execute effectively against the firm’s strategic plans and to manage the firm’s resources to grow revenues control expenses and return capital to the firm’s shareholders any significant failure by the firm’s board of directors to exercise appropriate oversight of management’s strategic decisions or any significant failure by the firm’s management to develop and execute on the firm’s strategic plans and business initiatives or the ineffectual 



implementation of business decisions the failure of the firm’s products or services or dealings with customers to meet customer expectations inadequate responses to regulatory requirements the failure to react quickly to changes in market conditions or structure or the failure to develop the necessary operational technology risk financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage the firm and its various businesses could adversely affect the firm’s competitive standing and negatively affect the firm’s earnings and future results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic monetary and political developments in the us and around the world 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various us and nonus regulatory authorities and agencies the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the us and the return earned on those loans and investments changes in federal reserve policies as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of nonus central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies such as “pegging” the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others are beyond the firm’s control and may be difficult to predict and consequently unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the firm’s activities and results of operations 

the firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and marketmaking in securities loans and other obligations of companies worldwide these risks include among others negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions or the risk of loss from unfavorable political legal or other developments including social or political instability in the countries or regions in which such companies operate as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below 

several of the firm’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of us and nonus governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities these activities can expose the firm to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputation risks including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government any or all of which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations 

further various countries or regions in which the firm operates or invests or in which the firm may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions in some cases concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to “market contagion” affecting other countries in the same region or beyond the 

 

region in addition governments in particular countries or regions in which the firm or its client do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions which could lead to diminished crossborder trade and financing activity within that country or region all of which could negatively affect the firm’s business and earnings in those jurisdictions 

political and economic uncertainty can also undermine consumer business and investor confidence and thereby contribute to market volatility for example uncertainties concerning the timing and terms of the uk’s planned departure from the eu could have an adverse effect on global financial markets and may adversely impact global economic conditions more generally furthermore depending on the nature of the arrangements agreed between the uk and the eu including with respect to the ability of financial services companies to engage in business in the eu from legal entities organized in or operating from the uk it is possible that under some scenarios the firm may need to make changes to its legal entity structure and operations and the locations in which it operates which might result in a less efficient operating model across the firm’s european legal entities accordingly it is possible that political or economic developments in certain countries even in countries in which the firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities may adversely affect the firm 

the firm must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by ofac and similar multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside us including most recently sanctions targeted at individuals and companies in russia a violation of a sanction or embargo program could subject the firm and individual employees to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties 

jpmorgan chase’s operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political social and economic factors and may be subject to additional compliance costs and risks 

some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts its businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than the us and other developed markets in which the firm currently operates some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation low or negative growth or defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt among other negative conditions or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment in addition these countries as well as certain more developed countries have recently been more susceptible to unfavorable political social or economic developments these developments have in the past resulted in and may in the future lead to social unrest 



part i 

general strikes and demonstrations crime and corruption security and personal safety issues outbreaks of hostilities overthrow of incumbent governments terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord all of which can adversely affect the firm’s operations or investments in such countries political social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the firm conducts its businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations 

less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the firm’s operations in those countries including among others the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies 

revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations as well as due to governmental actions including monetary policies expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can affect and in the past conditions of these types have affected the firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries including the firm’s operations in the us as a result any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the firm’s business and results of operations 

conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that the firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that the firm will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators in addition the firm can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses outside the us to comply with us anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations 

 

jpmorgan chase relies on the effectiveness and integrity of its processes operational systems and employees and those of third parties and certain failures of such processes or systems or errors or misconduct by such employees could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are dependent on the firm’s ability to process record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis the firm’s front and backoffice trading systems similarly rely on their access to and on the functionality of the operational systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems central counterparties securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies if the firm’s financial accounting trading or other data processing systems or the operational systems of third parties on which the firm’s businesses are dependent are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially and adversely affected moreover as the speed frequency volume and complexity of transactions and the requirements to report such transactions on a realtime basis to clients regulators and financial intermediaries increases the risk of human andor systems error in connection with such transactions increases and it becomes more challenging to maintain the firm’s operational systems and infrastructure the effective functioning of the firm’s operational systems is also dependent on the competence and reliability of its employees as well as the employees of third parties on whom the firm relies for technological support and the firm could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of the firm or a third party in addition when the firm changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions the firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes any of these occurrences could diminish the firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients and customers increased operating expenses higher litigation costs including fines and sanctions damage to reputation impairment of liquidity regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm 

third parties with which the firm does business including retailers data aggregators and other third parties with which the firm’s customers do business can also be sources of operational risk to the firm particularly where activities of customers or such third parties are beyond the firm’s security and control systems such as through the use of the internet personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services as the firm’s interconnectivity with customers and other third parties increases the firm increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems security breaches affecting the firm’s customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting such other third 



parties may require the firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the firm or its customers thereby increasing the firm’s operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction furthermore the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents exchanges and clearing houses and the increased importance of these entities increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially impact the firm’s ability to conduct business 

the firm’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving us and nonus laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals including clients client’s clients employees of the firm and its suppliers and other third parties ensuring that the firm’s collection use transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict can increase the firm’s operating costs impact the development of new products or services and require significant oversight by management and may require the firm to structure its businesses operations and systems in less efficient ways furthermore the firm may not be able to ensure that all of its clients suppliers counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and the firm particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means if personal confidential or proprietary information of clients customers employees or others were to be mishandled or misused in situations where for example such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties the firm could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions concerns regarding the effectiveness of the firm’s measures to safeguard personal information or even the perception that such measures are inadequate could cause the firm to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce the firm’s revenues accordingly any failure or perceived failure by the firm to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or significant liabilities fines or penalties and could damage the firm’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses 

the firm may be subject to disruptions of its operational systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the firm’s control which may include for example security breaches as discussed further below electrical or telecommunications outages failures of computer servers or other damage to the firm’s property or assets natural disasters or severe weather conditions health emergencies or pandemics or events arising from local or largerscale political events including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts jpmorgan chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure 

 

that the firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption while the firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the firm or its customers and clients any failures or disruptions of the firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the firm to losses or liability or require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption as well as by exposing the firm to litigation regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance 

a breach in the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems or those of other market participants could disrupt the firm’s businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage the firm’s reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the firm 

although jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the firm’s computer systems software networks and other technology assets as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to the firm and its customers and clients there is no assurance that all of the firm’s security measures will provide absolute security jpmorgan chase and other companies as well as governmental and political organizations have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites networks or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means the firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses and has experienced several significant distributed denialofservice attacks from technically sophisticated and wellresourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services 

despite the firm’s efforts to ensure the security and integrity of its systems it is possible that the firm may not be able to anticipate detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside the firm especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments and such third parties may seek to gain access to the firm’s systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees customers thirdparty service providers or other users of the firm’s systems these risks may increase in the future as the firm continues to increase its mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and 



part i 

expands its internal usage of webbased products and applications 

given the breadth of the firm’s operations the high volume of transactions that it processes the large number of customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which the firm does business and the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks a particular cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected the extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that the firm may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation could be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known during such time the firm may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the firm’s systems or the systems of another market participant could cause serious negative consequences for the firm including significant disruption of the firm’s operations and those of its clients customers and counterparties misappropriation of confidential information of the firm or that of its clients customers counterparties or employees or damage to computers or systems of the firm and those of its clients customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to the firm or to its customers loss of confidence in the firm’s security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure and harm to the firm’s reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on the firm 

risk management 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the firm thereby resulting in losses 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the firm the firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which the firm is subject however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to the firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist or develop in the future risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified in addition the firm relies on data to aggregate and assess its various risk exposures and any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of the firm’s data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting any lapse in the firm’s risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the firm’s risk management framework governance procedures practices models or risk reporting systems could individually or in the aggregate cause unexpected losses for the firm materially and adversely affect the firm’s 

 

financial condition and results of operations require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency attract heightened regulatory scrutiny expose the firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings subject the firm to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

the firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposures and also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the firm in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to the firm’s financial results and condition and require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations as is the case with any such assessments there is always the possibility that the firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

certain of the firm’s trading transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the firm does not own if the firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays which could damage the firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business in addition in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis the firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default the firm may be exposed to market and operational losses 

many of the firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by the firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress including difficult or less liquid market environments or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the firm’s risk management strategies causing the firm to incur losses 

many of the models used by the firm are subject to review not only by the firm’s model risk function but also by the firm’s regulators in order that the firm may utilize such models in connection with the firm’s calculations of market risk rwa credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under basel iii the firm may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses if such models do not receive approval by its regulators 



in addition the firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the firm these requirements apply to the firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and more specifically under certain of the consent orders to which the firm has been subject the firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships failure by the firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could result in potential liability to clients and customers fines penalties or judgments imposed by the firm’s regulators increased operating expenses and harm to the firm’s reputation any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm 

other risks 

actions or inaction by employees of the firm may cause harm to the firm’s clients and customers damage the firm’s reputation negatively impact the firm’s culture and lead to liability and regulatory and other governmental actions against the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s employees interact with clients customers and counterparties every day and they are expected through their conduct to demonstrate the firm’s values and exhibit the culture and behaviors that are an integral part of the firm’s how we do business principles including the firm’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way” if an employee takes an action including a failure to act that does not comply with the firm’s code of conduct is inconsistent with the firm’s how we do business principles or that otherwise harms clients consumers or the market such as improperly selling and marketing the firm’s product or services acting illegally with others to establish market prices improperly hiring individuals related to “politically exposed persons” or misappropriating firm property or confidential or proprietary information or technology belonging to the firm its customers or third parties such activities could give rise to litigation regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions and judgments settlements fines or penalties and lead to requirements that the firm restructure certain of its operations and activities all of which could harm the firm’s reputation or result in collateral consequences although the firm endeavors to embed culture and conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle including recruiting onboarding training and development and performance management as well as through the firm’s promotion and compensation processes employees of the firm have from time to time in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct resulting in litigation as well as settlements involving consent orders deferred prosecution agreements and nonprosecution agreements as well as other civil and criminal settlements with regulators and other governmental entities and there is no assurance that further inappropriate actions by employees will not occur or 

 

that any such actions will always be deterred or quickly prevented 

the financial services industry is highly competitive and jpmorgan chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the firm expects that competition in the us and global financial services industry will continue to be intense competitors of the firm include other banks and financial institutions trading advisory and investment management firms finance companies and technology companies and other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading payment processing and online automated algorithmicbased investment advice new technologies have required and could require the firm to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors including technology companies 

ongoing or increased competition on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered transaction execution innovation reputation price or other factors may put downward pressure on prices and fees for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share in addition the failure of any of the firm’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers whether due to general market conditions or underperformance relative to competitors or to benchmarks could impact the firm’s ability to retain clients and customers or attract new clients and customers thereby reducing the firm’s revenues increased competition also may require the firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive the firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations 

nonus competitors of the firm’s wholesale businesses outside the us are typically subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes the more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to us financial services institutions such as jpmorgan chase can put the firm at a competitive disadvantage to its nonus competitors including prohibiting the firm from engaging in certain transactions imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements on the firm making the firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the firm’s cost structure for providing certain products all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the firm’s wholesale businesses

jpmorgan chase’s employees are the firm’s most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense the firm endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees there is the potential for changes in immigration policies in multiple jurisdictions around the world including the us and to the extent that immigration policies were to unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which the firm has operations or conducts its business the firm could be adversely affected the firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent augmented from time to time by external hires to provide continuity of succession for the firm’s operating committee including the chief executive officer position and senior positions below the operating committee the firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a nextlevel role in addition the firm’s board of directors is deeply involved in succession planning including review of the succession plans for the chief executive officer and the members of the operating committee if the firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees including successors to the chief executive officer or members of the operating committee the firm’s performance including its competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase’s financial statements are based in part on estimates and judgments which if incorrect could result in unexpected losses in the future 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the us “us gaap” jpmorgan chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation among other items certain of the firm’s financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities instruments in the investment securities portfolio certain loans msrs structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the firm’s financial statements where quoted market prices are not available the firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment if estimates or judgments underlying the firm’s financial statements are incorrect the firm may experience material losses 

 

lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations profitability or reputation 

there can be no assurance that the firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition restrict its ability to access the capital markets require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies expose the firm to regulatory or legal proceedings subject it to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could damage its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to the firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers investors and employees damage to the firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the firm’s business and prospects harm to the firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct security breaches compliance failures litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations the firm’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate jointventurer or merchant banking portfolio company or a vendor or other third party with which the firm does business to comply with laws or regulations in addition the firm’s reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding the firm whether or not true that may be posted on social media nonmainstream news services or other parts of the internet and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels 

  

management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as the firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among the firm’s clients the failure or perceived failure to adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions likewise the failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality to treat customers and clients fairly to provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions in the future a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions all of which can lead to lost 



revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to the firm’s reputation 

actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the firm’s reputation for example the role played by financial services firms during and after the financial crisis including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions or that a financial institution had acted inappropriately with respect to the methods employed in offering products to customers have damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the firm’s reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to its reputation could not adversely affect the firm’s earnings and results of operations or that damage to the firm’s reputation will not impair the firm’s ability to retain its existing or attract new customers investors and employees

 item 9a controls and procedures 

the internal control framework promulgated by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” “internal control — integrated framework” “coso 2013” provides guidance for designing implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness the firm used the coso 2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 139  

as of the end of the period covered by this report an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the firm’s management including its chairman and chief executive officer and its chief financial officer of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on that evaluation the chairman and chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective see exhibits 311 and 312 for the certification statements issued by the chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer 

 

the firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting nevertheless because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future for further information see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 139  there was no change in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the three months ended   december 31 2016  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the firm’s internal control over financial reporting

competition 

jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks hedge funds commodity trading companies private equity firms insurance companies mutual fund companies investment managers credit card companies mortgage banking companies trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies financial technology companies and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services the firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the firm’s products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price competition also varies based on the types of clients customers industries and geographies served with respect to some of its geographies and products jpmorgan chase competes globally with respect to others the firm competes on a national or regional basis the firm’s ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel and on its reputation 

it is likely that competition in the financial services industry will become even more intense as the firm’s businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the firm or with companies that provide new or innovative products or services that the firm is unable to provide 

supervision and regulation 

the firm is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the us as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the us in which the firm does business 

as a result of regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in the us and abroad the firm has been experiencing a period of significant change in regulation which has had and could continue to have significant consequences for how the firm conducts business the firm continues to work diligently in assessing the regulatory changes it is facing and is devoting substantial resources to comply with all the new regulations while at the same time endeavoring to best meet the needs and expectations of its customers clients and shareholders these efforts include the implementation of new policies procedures and controls and appropriate adjustments to the firm’s business and operations legal entity structure and capital and liquidity 



part i 

management the combined effect of numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules present challenges and risks to the firm’s business and operations given the current status of the regulatory developments the firm cannot currently quantify all of the possible effects on its business and operations of the significant changes that are underway for more information see risk factors on pages 8–18  

financial holding company 

consolidated supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve”  as a bank holding company “bhc” and a financial holding company jpmorgan chase is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the federal reserve the federal reserve acts as an “umbrella regulator” and certain of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries for example jpmorgan chase’s national bank subsidiaries such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” and with respect to certain matters by the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” certain nonbank subsidiaries such as the firm’s us brokerdealers are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec and subsidiaries of the firm that engage in certain futuresrelated and swapsrelated activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” see securities and brokerdealer regulation investment management regulation and derivatives regulation below in addition the firm’s consumer activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” and to regulation under various state statutes which are enforced by the respective state’s attorney general 

scope of permissible business activities the bank holding company act generally restricts bhcs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities financial holding companies generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for bhcs including underwriting dealing and making markets in securities and making merchant banking investments in nonfinancial companies the federal reserve has the authority to limit a financial holding company’s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible if the financial holding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements including requirements that the financial holding company and each of its us depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” the federal reserve may also impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may for example require divestiture of the holding company’s 

 

depository institutions if the deficiencies persist federal regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies in addition a financial holding company must obtain federal reserve approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the us and internationally as further described under regulation of acquisitions below 

activities restrictions under the volcker rule  section 619 of the wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” the “volcker rule” prohibits banking entities  including the firm from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities subject to exceptions for underwriting marketmaking riskmitigating hedging and certain other activities  in addition the volcker rule limits the sponsorship of and investment in “covered funds” as defined by the volcker rule and imposes limits on certain transactions between the firm and its sponsored funds see jpmorgan chase’s subsidiary banks — restrictions on transactions with affiliates below the volcker rule which became effective in july 2015 requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the volcker rule including in order to distinguish permissible from impermissible risktaking activities the measurement monitoring and reporting of certain key metrics   given the uncertainty and complexity of the volcker rule’s framework the full impact of the volcker rule will ultimately depend on its ongoing interpretation by the five regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight   

capital and liquidity requirements the federal reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for the firm and evaluates its compliance with such requirements the occ establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for the firm’s national banking subsidiaries for more information about the applicable requirements relating to riskbased capital and leverage in the us under the most recent capital framework established by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee”“basel iii” see capital management on pages 149–158  and note 28 under basel iii bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” the us banking regulators have approved the final lcr rule “us lcr” which became effective on january 1 2015 a proposed us rule for nsfr is expected for additional information on these ratios see liquidity risk management on pages 159–164  it is likely that the banking supervisors will continue to refine and enhance the basel iii capital framework for financial institutions the basel committee recently finalized revisions to market risk capital for trading books other proposals being contemplated by the basel committee include revisions to among others standardized credit and operational risk capital frameworks and revisions 



to the securitization framework after a proposal is finalized by the basel committee us banking regulators would then need to propose requirements applicable to us financial institutions 

stress tests  the federal reserve has adopted supervisory stress tests for large bank holding companies including jpmorgan chase which form part of the federal reserve’s annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” framework under the framework  the firm must conduct semiannual companyrun stress tests and in addition must submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by  the firm and the federal reserve  in reviewing the firm’s capital plan the federal reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors qualitative assessments include among other things the comprehensiveness of the plan the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan and the extent to which the firm has satisfied certain supervisory matters related to the firm’s processes and analyses including the design and operational effectiveness of the controls governing such processes moreover the firm is required to receive a notice of nonobjection from the federal reserve before taking capital actions such as paying dividends implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the occ requires jpmorgan chase bank na to perform separate similar annual stress tests  the firm publishes each year the results of its midcycle stress tests under the firm’s internallydeveloped “severely adverse” scenario and the results of its and its two primary subsidiary banks’ annual stress tests under the supervisory “severely adverse” scenarios provided by the federal reserve and the occ commencing with the 2016 ccar the annual ccar submission will be due on april 5 results will be published by the federal reserve by june 30 with disclosures of results by bhcs including the firm to follow within 15 days also commencing in 2016 the midcycle capital stress test submissions will be due on october 5 and bhcs including the firm will publish results by november 4 the federal reserve has indicated that it is currently evaluating the inclusion of all or part of the global systemically important bank “gsib” surcharge into the 2017 ccar test and the firm is currently awaiting further guidance for additional information on the firm’s ccar see capital management on pages 149–158  

enhanced prudential standards the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” among other things recommends prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements to the federal reserve for systemically important financial institutions such as jpmorgan chase the federal reserve has adopted several rules to implement the heightened prudential standards including final rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject bhcs bhcs with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk 

 

management standards including a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days and their board of directors is required to conduct appropriate oversight of their risk management activities for information on liquidity measures see liquidity risk management on pages 159–164  several additional proposed rules are still being considered including rules relating to singlecounterparty credit limits and an “early remediation” framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses 

risk reporting in january 2013 the basel committee issued new regulations relating to risk aggregation and reporting under these regulations the banking institution’s risk governance framework must encompass riskdata aggregation and reporting and data aggregation must be highly automated and allow for minimal manual intervention the regulations also impose higher standards for the accuracy comprehensiveness granularity and timely distribution of data reporting and call for regular supervisory review of the banking institution’s risk aggregation and reporting these new standards became effective for gsibs including the firm on january 1 2016 

orderly liquidation authority and resolution and recovery  as a bhc with assets of 50 billion or more the firm is required to submit annually to the federal reserve and the fdic a plan for resolution under the bankruptcy code in the event of material distress or failure a “resolution plan” the fdic also requires each insured depositary institution with 50 billion or more in assets such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na to provide a resolution plan for more information about the firm’s resolution plan see risk factors on pages 8–18  in addition certain financial companies including jpmorgan chase and certain of its subsidiaries can be subjected to resolution under an “orderly liquidation authority” the us treasury secretary in consultation with the president of the united states must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations and action must be recommended by the fdic and the federal reserve absent such actions the firm as a bhc would remain subject to resolution under the bankruptcy code in december 2013 the fdic issued a draft policy statement describing its “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of systemically important financial institutions under the orderly liquidation authority this strategy seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of the bhc open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority 

the firm has a comprehensive recovery plan detailing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining wellcapitalized and wellfunded in the case of an adverse event jpmorgan chase has provided the federal reserve with comprehensive confidential supervisory information and analyses about the firm’s businesses legal entities and corporate governance and about its crisis management governance capabilities and available alternatives to raise liquidity and capital in severe market circumstances the 



part i 

occ has published for comment proposed guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks including jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na 

regulators in the us and abroad continue to be focused on developing measures designed to address the possibility or perception that large financial institutions including the firm may be “too big to fail” and to provide safeguards so that if a large financial institution does fail it can be resolved without the use of public funds higher capital surcharges on gsibs requirements for certain large bank holding companies to maintain a minimum amount of longterm debt to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms and the international swaps and derivatives association “isda” protocol relating to the “closeout” of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large crossborder financial institution are examples of initiatives to address “too big to fail” for further information on the potential impact of the gsib framework and total loss absorbing capacity “tlac” see capital management on pages 149–158  and risk factors on pages 8–18  and on the isda closeout protocol see derivatives regulation below 

holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries  jpmorgan chase  co is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when the firm might otherwise determine not to provide it 

regulation of acquisitions acquisitions by bank holding companies and their banks are subject to multiple requirements by the federal reserve and the occ for example financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank in addition acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if as a result of the acquisition the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10 of the total liabilities of all financial companies in contrast because the liabilities of nonus financial companies are calculated differently under this rule a nonus financial company could hold significantly more than 10 of the us market without exceeding the concentration limit in addition for certain acquisitions the firm must provide written notice to the federal reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over 10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in nature” 

jpmorgan chase’s subsidiary banks 

the firm’s two primary subsidiary banks jpmorgan chase bank na  and chase bank usa na are fdicinsured national banks regulated by the occ  as national banks  the activities of jpmorgan chase bank na  and chase bank usa na are limited to those specifically authorized under the national bank act and related interpretations by the occ   

 

fdic deposit insurance  the fdic deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits which is funded through assessments on banks such as jpmorgan chase bank na  and chase bank usa na changes in the methodology used to calculate such assessments resulting from the enactment of the doddfrank act significantly increased the assessments  that the firm’s bank subsidiaries pay annually to the fdic in october 2015 the fdic proposed a new assessment surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets greater than 10 billion in order to raise the reserve ratio for the fdic deposit insurance fund future fdic rulemaking could further increase such assessments   

fdic powers upon a bank insolvency  upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution such as jpmorgan chase bank na the fdic may be appointed as the conservator or receiver under the federal deposit insurance act “fdia”   in addition   where a systemically important financial institution such as jpmorgan chase  co is “in default” or “in danger of default” the fdic may be appointed as receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation in both cases the fdic has broad powers to transfer any assets and liabilities without the approval of the institution’s creditors   

crossguarantee an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic if another fdicinsured institution that is under common control with such institution is in default or is deemed to be “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution   

prompt corrective action and early remediation  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as jpmorgan chase bank na  and chase bank usa na  the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent  bhc such as jpmorgan chase  co based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary in certain instances the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary   

occ heightened standards  the occ has issued final regulations and guidelines establishing heightened standards for large banks the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks while  the bank may use certain components of  the parent company’s risk governance framework the framework must ensure that  the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from  the parent for risk management purposes  the bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for approving  the 



bank’s risk governance framework providing active oversight of  the bank’s risktaking activities and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework   

restrictions on transactions with affiliates   the bank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase including subsidiaries of those banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to investments in stock or securities of and derivatives securities lending and certain other transactions with jpmorgan chase  co and certain other affiliates these restrictions prevent jpmorgan chase  co and other affiliates from borrowing from  such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements for more information see note  27 in addition the volcker rule imposes a prohibition on such transactions between any jpmorgan chase entity and covered funds for which a jpmorgan chase entity serves as the investment manager investment advisor commodity trading advisor or sponsor as well as subject to a limited exception any covered fund controlled by such funds   

dividend restrictions  federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks such as jpmorgan chase bank na  and chase bank usa na see note  27 for the amount of dividends that  the firm’s principal bank subsidiaries could pay at january 1 2016 to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators   

in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the occ and the federal reserve have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of the bank subsidiaries they supervise if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank   

depositor preference  under federal law the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities including the fdic have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including public noteholders and depositors in nonus offices as a result such persons could receive substantially less than the depositors in us offices of the depository institution the uk prudential regulation authority the “pra” a subsidiary of the bank of england which has responsibility for prudential regulation of banks and other systemically important institutions has issued a proposal that may require  the firm to either obtain equal treatment for uk depositors or “subsidiarize” in the uk in september 2013 the fdic issued a final rule which clarifies that foreign deposits are considered deposits under the fdia if they are payable in the us  as well as in the foreign branch 

cfpb regulation and supervision and other consumer regulations  jpmorgan chase and its national bank subsidiaries including jpmorgan chase bank na  and chase bank usa na  are subject to supervision and regulation by the cfpb with respect to federal consumer

item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chase ’s financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm 

regulatory risk 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and the firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the firm is subject 

as a global financial services firm jpmorgan chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the us and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the us in which the firm does business the financial services industry has experienced and continues to experience an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision both in the us and globally and the cumulative effect of all of the new and proposed legislation and regulations on the firm’s business operations and profitability remains uncertain 

the recent legislative and regulatory developments as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the us and in the other countries in which the firm operates and any required changes to the firm’s business or operations resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue for the firm impose additional compliance and other costs on the firm or otherwise reduce the firm’s profitability limit the products and services that the firm offers or its ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging require the firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses affect the value of assets that the firm holds require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products or otherwise adversely affect the firm’s businesses in addition to the extent that legislative or regulatory initiatives are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions based on size activities geography or other criteria the requirements to which the firm may be subject under such laws and regulations could require the firm to restructure its businesses or reprice or curtail the products or services that it offers to customers which could result in the firm not being able to compete effectively with other institutions that are not impacted in the same way 

 

in addition there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the us and in different countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example recent legislative and regulatory initiatives within the eu including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions the separation of trading activities from core banking services mandatory onexchange trading position limits and reporting rules for derivatives conduct of business requirements restrictions on compensation and governance and accountability regimes could require the firm to make significant modifications to its nonus business operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements these differences in implemented or proposed nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the us which could subject the firm to increased compliance and legal costs as well as higher operational capital and liquidity costs all of which could have an adverse effect on the firm’s business results of operations and profitability 

expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of jpmorgan chase’s businesses may continue to increase the firm’s costs and risks 

the firm’s businesses and operations are increasingly subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny the firm has paid significant fines or has provided significant monetary and other relief to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies the firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject which increases the firm’s operational and compliance costs 

certain regulators have taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions against financial institutions including the firm that require admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters such admissions and conditions can lead to among other things greater exposure in civil litigation harm to reputation disqualification from providing business to certain clients and in certain jurisdictions and other direct and indirect adverse effects 

in addition us government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions including the firm and have increasingly sought and obtained resolutions that include criminal pleas from those institutions such as the firm’s agreement in may 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities such resolutions whether with us or nonus authorities could have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution including loss of customers and business or the inability to offer certain products or services or losing permission to operate certain businesses for a period of time absent the 



forbearance of or the granting of waivers by applicable regulators 

the firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than with informal supervisory action 

in addition if the firm fails to meet the requirements of the various governmental settlements to which it is subject or more generally to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements pay additional fines penalties or judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses the extent of the firm’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could in some cases substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the firm has established for such matters 

requirements for the orderly resolution of the firm could require jpmorgan chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses and holders of jpmorgan chase’s debt and equity securities would be at risk of absorbing losses if the firm were to enter into a resolution 

under title i of the doddfrank act “title i” and federal reserve and fdic rules the firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the federal reserve and the fdic a detailed plan for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its subsidiaries under the us bankruptcy code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure in august 2014 the federal reserve and the fdic announced the completion of their reviews of the second round of title i resolution plans submitted by eleven large complex banking organizations in 2013 including the firm the agencies jointly identified specific shortcomings with the 2013 resolution plans including the firm’s 2013 plan the fdic’s board of directors determined under title i that the 2013 resolution plans including the firm’s 2013 plan were not credible and did not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code the federal reserve board determined that the eleven banking organizations must take immediate actions to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 plans the firm has devoted significant resources to its resolution planning efforts and believes that in its most recent title i resolution plan submitted to the federal reserve and fdic in july 2015 it has addressed or has made substantial progress in addressing each of the shortcomings previously identified by the agencies 

however if the federal reserve and the fdic were to jointly determine that the firm’s 2015 plan or any future update of that plan is not credible and the firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital 

 

leverage or liquidity requirements on the firm or restrictions on growth activities or operations of the firm and could if such deficiencies are not remedied within two years after such a determination require the firm to restructure reorganize or divest businesses legal entities operational systems andor intercompany transactions in ways that could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations and strategy in addition in order to develop a title i resolution plan that the federal reserve and fdic determine is credible the firm may need to make certain changes to its legal entity structure and to certain intercompany and external activities which could result in increased funding or operational costs 

in addition to the firm’s plan for orderly resolution the firm’s resolution plan also recommends to the federal reserve and the fdic its proposed optimal strategy to resolve the firm under the special resolution procedure provided in title ii of the doddfrank act “title ii” the firm’s recommendation involves a “single point of entry” recapitalization model in which the fdic would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for jpmorgan chase transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the firm’s business principally the stock of jpmorgan chase  co’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries to the bridge entity recapitalize those subsidiaries by among other things converting some or all of such intercompany claims to capital and exchange external debt claims against jpmorgan chase  co for equity in the bridge entity as discussed below the federal reserve has also proposed rules regarding the minimum levels of unsecured external longterm debt and other lossabsorbing capacity that bank holding companies would be required to have issued and outstanding as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalization of the bridge entity and operating subsidiaries “eligible ltd” if jpmorgan chase  co were to enter into a resolution either in a proceeding under the us bankruptcy code or in a receivership administered by the fdic under title ii of the doddfrank act holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the firm would be at risk of absorbing the losses of jpmorgan chase  co and its affiliates if jpmorgan chase  co commenced proceedings under the us bankruptcy code creditors and shareholders of jpmorgan chase  co would realize value only to the extent available to jpmorgan chase  co as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank na and its other subsidiaries after the payment to the creditors of such subsidiaries in addition even under the firm’s preferred resolution strategy under title ii of the doddfrank act the value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of the firm’s eligible ltd and other debt securities may not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such debt it is also possible that the application of the firm’s recommended title ii strategy could result in greater losses to security holders of jpmorgan chase  co than the losses that would result from a different resolution strategy for the firm 



part i 

market risk 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by us and global financial market and economic conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions including the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates currency and commodities prices including oil prices and other market indices investor consumer and business sentiment events that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit the economic effects of natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics severe weather conditions outbreaks of hostilities terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities monetary policies and actions taken by the federal reserve and other central banks and the health of the us and global economies these conditions can affect the firm’s businesses both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the firm’s clients and customers 

in the firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses the abovementioned factors can affect the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its clients and customers and therefore the revenue that the firm receives as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the firm 

the firm generally maintains marketmaking positions in the fixed income currency commodities credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients the revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors including the firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets interest rate and credit spreads and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions certain of the firm’s marketmaking positions could be adversely affected by the lack of liquidity which will be influenced by many of these factors and which could affect the firm’s ability to realize returns from such activities and adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the firm may be adversely affected by declining asset values this is particularly true for businesses that earn fees for managing thirdparty assets or receive or post collateral for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that the firm manages or holds in custody which in turn could affect the firm’s revenue macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the firm’s funds or accounts or cause clients to invest funds in products that generate lower revenue 

changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the firm earns from net interest income a low interest rate environment may compress net interest margins 

 

reducing the amounts that the firm earns on its investment securities portfolio or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights “msr” asset thereby reducing the firm’s net interest income and other revenues conversely increasing or high interest rates may result in increased funding costs lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the investment securities portfolio to the extent that the firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higheryielding assets thereby adversely affecting the firm’s revenues and capital levels 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by us domestic economic conditions including us interest rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies if the recent positive trends in the us economy are not sustained this could diminish demand for the products and services of the firm’s consumer businesses or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment due to economic dislocations in certain geographies or industries caused by falling oil and gas prices or other market or economic factors could lead to an increase in mortgage credit card auto student and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce the firm’s earnings 

widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis and may adversely affect the credit markets and the firm’s businesses credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to firmspecific events and circumstances but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in the firm’s credit spreads will impact positively or negatively the firm’s earnings on certain liabilities that are recorded at fair value 

sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets including loans and derivatives may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets adversely affect the firm’s profitability capital or liquidity or increase the firm’s funding costs sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence which could lead to lower client activity and decreased revenue for the firm 

credit risk 

the financial condition of jpmorgan chase’s customers clients and counterparties particularly other financial institutions could adversely affect the firm 

the firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds investment managers and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose the firm to credit risk and in some cases disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client the failure of a significant market participant or concerns about a default by such an institution could also 



lead to significant liquidity problems for or losses or defaults by other institutions which in turn could adversely affect the firm in addition in recent years the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated antitrust or anticompetition laws by colluding to manipulate markets prices or indices and there is no assurance that such allegations will not arise in the same or similar contexts in the future 

as part of providing clearing services the firm is a member of a number of central counterparties “ccps” and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members as a clearing member the firm is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral in addition the firm can be exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management clearing custodial and other transaction services to such clients if a client for which the firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent the firm may suffer losses become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties including one or more ccps or the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations all of such events can increase the firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the firm is insufficient to cover such losses 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity the firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to the firm further disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and the firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral 

concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses 

jpmorgan chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers or counterparties are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions for example a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the firm’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other borrowers or counterparties in similar related or dependent industries and thereby could exacerbate the firm’s credit risk exposure and potentially increase its losses including marktomarket losses in its trading businesses similarly challenging economic conditions affecting a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of the firm’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in 

 

related or dependent industries wherever located or about the ability of customers of the firm’s consumer businesses living in such areas or working in such affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to the firm as a result the firm regularly monitors various segments of its exposures to assess potential concentration or contagion risks the firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against concentration risks may not be successful 

in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the firm’s inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of its positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce the firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but may also increase the level of riskweighted assets on the firm’s balance sheet thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the firm’s businesses 

liquidity risk 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses some potential conditions that could impair the firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption unforeseen cash or capital requirements including among others commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets default by a ccp or other counterparty unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in the firm or financial markets in general these conditions may be caused by events over which the firm has little or no control the widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages credit card receivables and other assets during that time and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future 

if the firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding such as bank deposits is reduced the firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability in addition the firm’s cost of funding could be affected by actions that the firm may take in order to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements to lower its gsib systemic risk score or to satisfy the amount of eligible ltd that the firm must have outstanding under the final tlac rules 

as a holding company jpmorgan chase  co relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and consequently its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends loans or other payments several of jpmorgan chase  co’s principal subsidiaries are 



part i 

subject to dividend distribution capital adequacy or liquidity coverage requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments limitations in the payments that jpmorgan chase  co receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations 

proposed banking regulations relating to liquidity including us rules relating to total lossabsorbing capacity could require jpmorgan chase to issue a substantial amount of new debt and thereby significantly increase its funding costs 

on october 30 2015 the federal reserve issued proposed rules the “proposed tlac rules” that would require the toptier holding companies of eight us global systemically important bank holding companies “us gsib bhcs” including jpmorgan chase  co among other things to maintain minimum amounts of eligible ltd commencing january 1 2019 the proposed tlac rules would disqualify from eligible ltd among other instruments senior debt securities that permit acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default as well as debt securities that are not governed by us law and structured notes the currently outstanding senior longterm debt of us gsib bhcs including jpmorgan chase  co includes structured notes as well as other debt that typically permits acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default and as a result none of such outstanding senior longterm debt or any subsequently issued senior longterm debt with similar terms would qualify as eligible ltd under the proposed tlac rules the federal reserve has requested comment on whether certain currently outstanding instruments should be allowed to count as eligible ltd “despite containing features that would be prohibited under the proposal” the steps that the us gsib bhcs including jpmorgan chase  co may need to take to   come into compliance with the final tlac rules including the amount and form of longterm debt that must be refinanced or issued will depend in substantial part on the ultimate eligibility requirements for senior longterm debt and any grandfathering provisions to the extent that outstanding senior longterm debt of jpmorgan chase  co is not classified as eligible ltd under the tlac rule as finally adopted by the federal reserve the firm could be required to issue a substantial amount of new senior longterm debt which could significantly increase the firm’s funding costs 

authorities in some nonus jurisdictions in which the firm has operations have enacted legislation or regulations requiring that certain subsidiaries of the firm operating in those countries maintain independent capital and liquidity in addition some nonus regulators have proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries these requirements and any future laws or regulations that seek to increase capital or liquidity requirements that would be applicable to nonus subsidiaries of the firm could hinder the firm’s ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner 

 

reductions in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the firm 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies rating agencies evaluate both general and firm and industryspecific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution including economic and geopolitical trends regulatory developments future profitability risk management practices legal expenses assumptions surrounding government support and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and nonbank subsidiaries although the firm closely monitors and manages to the extent it is able factors that could influence its credit ratings there is no assurance that the firm’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

furthermore a reduction in the firm’s credit ratings could reduce the firm’s access to capital markets materially increase the cost of issuing securities trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted contractually or otherwise to do business with or lend to the firm thereby curtailing the firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability in addition any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries and as a result could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future 

legal risk 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties actions currently pending against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm which could materially and adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious harm to the firm’s reputation as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that the firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations 

in addition and as noted above the firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions regulators and other government agencies examine the operations of the firm and its subsidiaries on both a routine and targetedexam basis and there is no assurance that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the firm in the future 



a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the us or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in nonus jurisdictions these and other initiatives from us and nonus governmental authorities and officials may subject the firm to further judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause the firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of which could harm the firm’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs thereby reducing the firm’s profitability or result in collateral consequences as discussed above 

other business risks 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic monetary and political developments in the us and around the world 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various us and nonus regulatory authorities and agencies the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the us and the return earned on those loans and investments changes in federal reserve policies as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of nonus central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies such as “pegging” the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others are beyond the firm’s control and may be difficult to predict and consequently unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the firm’s activities and results of operations 

the firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and marketmaking in securities loans and other obligations of companies worldwide these risks include among others negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions or the risk of loss from unfavorable political legal or other developments including social or political instability in the countries or regions in which such companies operate as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below 

several of the firm’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of us and nonus governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities these activities can expose the firm to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputation risks including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations 

further various countries or regions in which the firm operates or invests or in which the firm may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions low or volatile oil prices coupled with the slowdown in the 

 

macroeconomic prospects in china and concerns about economic weaknesses in the eurozone including the permanent resolution of the greek “bailout” program could continue to undermine investor confidence and affect the operating environment in 2016 in some cases concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to “market contagion” affecting other countries in the same region or beyond the region accordingly it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries even in countries in which the firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities may adversely affect the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political social and economic factors and may be subject to additional compliance costs and risks 

some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts its businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than the us and other developed markets in which the firm currently operates some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation low or negative growth or defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt among other negative conditions or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment in addition these countries as well as certain more developed countries have recently been more susceptible to unfavorable political social or economic developments these development have in the past resulted in and may in the future lead to social unrest general strikes and demonstrations crime and corruption security and personal safety issues outbreaks of hostilities overthrow of incumbent governments terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord all of which can adversely affect the firm’s operations or investments in such countries political social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the firm conducts its businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations 

less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the firm’s operations in those countries including among others the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions 



part i 

revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations as well as due to governmental actions including monetary policies expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can affect and in the past conditions of these types have affected the firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries including the firm’s operations in the us as a result any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the firm’s business and results of operations 

conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that the firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that the firm will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators in addition the firm can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses outside the us to comply with us anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations 

jpmorgan chase relies on the effectiveness and integrity of its processes operating systems and employees and those of third parties and certain failures of such processes or systems or misconduct by such employees could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are dependent on the firm’s ability to process record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis the firm’s front and backoffice trading systems similarly rely on their access to and on the functionality of the operating systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems central counterparties securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies if the firm’s financial accounting trading or other data processing systems or the operating systems of third parties on which the firm’s businesses are dependent are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially and adversely affected moreover as the speed frequency volume and complexity of transactions and the requirements to report such transactions on a realtime basis to clients regulators and financial intermediaries increases the risk of human andor systems error in connection with such transactions increases and it becomes 

 

more challenging to maintain the firm’s operational systems and infrastructure the firm is similarly dependent on its employees the firm could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firm’s operations or systems in addition when the firm changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions the firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes any of these occurrences could diminish the firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients and customers increased operating expenses higher litigation costs including fines and sanctions damage to reputation impairment of liquidity regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm 

third parties with which the firm does business including retailers and other third parties with which the firm’s customers do business can also be sources of operational risk to the firm particularly where activities of customers are beyond the firm’s security and control systems such as through the use of the internet personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services as the firm’s interconnectivity with these third parties increases the firm increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems security breaches affecting the firm’s customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties may require the firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the firm or its customers thereby increasing the firm’s operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction furthermore the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents exchanges and clearing houses and the increased importance of these entities increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially impact the firm’s ability to conduct business 

the firm’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving us and nonus laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals including clients client’s clients employees of the firm and its suppliers and other third parties ensuring that the firm’s collection use transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict can increase the firm’s operating costs impact the development of new products or services and require significant oversight by management and may require the firm to structure its businesses operations and systems in less efficient ways furthermore the firm may not be able to ensure that all of its clients suppliers counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and the firm particularly where such information is transmitted by 



electronic means if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients or others were to be mishandled or misused in situations where for example such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties the firm could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions concerns regarding the effectiveness of the firm’s measures to safeguard personal information or even the perception that such measures are inadequate could cause the firm to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce the firm’s revenues accordingly any failure or perceived failure by the firm to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities fines or penalties and could damage the firm’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses 

the firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the firm’s control which may include for example security breaches as discussed further below electrical or telecommunications outages failures of computer servers or other damage to the firm’s property or assets natural disasters or severe weather conditions health emergencies or pandemics or events arising from local or largerscale political events including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts jpmorgan chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption while the firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the firm or its customers and clients any failures or disruptions of the firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the firm to losses or liability or require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption as well as by exposing the firm to litigation regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance 

a breach in the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems or those of other market participants could disrupt the firm’s businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the firm 

although jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the firm’s computer systems software networks and other technology assets as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to the firm and its customers and clients there is no assurance that all of the firm’s security measures will provide absolute security 

 

jpmorgan chase and other companies have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means the firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses and has experienced several significant distributed denialofservice attacks from technically sophisticated and wellresourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services 

despite the firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems it is possible that the firm may not be able to anticipate detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside the firm especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties outside the firm such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers thirdparty service providers or other users of the firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the firm’s data or that of its customers or clients these risks may increase in the future as the firm continues to increase its mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expands its internal usage of webbased products and applications 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the firm’s systems or the systems of another market participant could cause serious negative consequences for the firm including significant disruption of the firm’s operations misappropriation of confidential information of the firm or that of its customers or damage to computers or systems of the firm and those of its customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to the firm or to its customers loss of confidence in the firm’s security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure and harm to the firm’s reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on the firm 

risk management 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the firm thereby resulting in losses 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the firm the firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which the firm is subject however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to the firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist or develop 



part i 

in the future risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified in addition the firm relies on data to aggregate and assess its various risk exposures and any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of the firm’s data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting any lapse in the firm’s risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the firm’s risk management framework governance procedures practices models or risk reporting systems could individually or in the aggregate cause unexpected losses for the firm materially and adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency attract heightened regulatory scrutiny expose the firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings subject the firm to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

the firm’s products including loans leases lending commitments derivatives and trading account assets as well as the investment securities portfolio and cash management and clearing activities expose the firm to credit risk the firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties and the credit quality of the firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings the firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure including unfunded lendingrelated commitments the firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the firm in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to the firm’s financial results and condition and require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations as is the case with any such assessments there is always the possibility that the firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

jpmorgan chase’s marketmaking businesses may expose the firm to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause the firm to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative 

certain of the firm’s trading transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the firm does not own if the firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays which could damage the firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business in addition in situations 

 

where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis the firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default the firm may be exposed to market and operational losses in particular 

in addition disputes with counterparties may arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts including with respect to the value of underlying collateral which could cause the firm to incur unexpected costs including transaction operational legal and litigation costs or result in credit losses all of which may impair the firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products 

in a difficult or less liquid market environment the firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for the firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants or widespread market dislocations 

many of the firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by the firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the firm’s risk management strategies causing the firm to incur losses 

many of the models used by the firm are subject to review not only by the firm’s model risk function but also by the firm’s regulators in order that the firm may utilize such models in connection with the firm’s calculations of market risk riskweighted assets “rwa” credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under the advanced approach of basel iii the firm may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses if such models do not receive approval by its regulators 

in addition the firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the firm these requirements apply to the firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and more specifically under certain of the consent orders to which the firm has been subject the firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships failure by the firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could 



result in potential liability to clients and customers fines penalties or judgments imposed by the firm’s regulators increased operating expenses and harm to the firm’s reputation any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm 

other risks 

the financial services industry is highly competitive and jpmorgan chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the firm expects that competition in the us and global financial services industry will continue to be intense competitors of the firm include other banks and financial institutions trading advisory and investment management firms finance companies and technology companies and other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading and payment processing new technologies have required and could require the firm to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors including technology companies 

ongoing or increased competition on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered transaction execution innovation reputation price or other factors may put downward pressure on prices for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share in addition the failure of any of the firm’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers whether due to general market conditions or underperformance relative to competitors or to benchmarks could impact the firm’s ability to retain clients and customers or attract new clients and customers thereby reducing the firm’s revenues increased competition also may require the firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive the firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations 

competitors of the firm’s nonus wholesale businesses are typically subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes the more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to us financial services institutions such as jpmorgan chase can put the firm at a competitive disadvantage to its nonus competitors including prohibiting the firm from engaging in certain transactions imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements on the firm making the firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the firm’s cost structure for providing certain products all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the firm’s wholesale businesses 

 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are the firm’s most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense the firm endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees the firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent augmented from time to time by external hires to provide continuity of succession for the firm’s operating committee including the chief executive officer position and senior positions below the operating committee the firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a nextlevel role in addition the firm’s board of directors is deeply involved in succession planning including review of the succession plans for the chief executive officer and the members of the operating committee if for any reason the firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees including successors to the chief executive officer or members of the operating committee the firm’s performance including its competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase’s financial statements are based in part on estimates and judgments which if incorrect could result in unexpected losses in the future 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the us “us gaap” jpmorgan chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation among other items certain of the firm’s financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities instruments in the investment securities portfolio certain loans msrs structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the firm’s financial statements where quoted market prices are not available the firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment if estimates or judgments underlying the firm’s financial statements are incorrect the firm may experience material losses 

lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations profitability or reputation 

there can be no assurance that the firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur any such lapses or deficiencies may materially 



part i 

and adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition restrict its ability to access the capital markets require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies expose the firm to regulatory or legal proceedings subject it to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could damage its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to the firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers investors and employees damage to the firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the firm’s business and prospects harm to the firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct security breaches compliance failures litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations the firm’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate jointventurer or merchant banking portfolio company or a vendor or other third party with which the firm does business to comply with laws or regulations in addition a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality to treat customers and clients fairly to provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the appropriate standards or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations can result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and harm to the firm’s reputation adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding the firm whether or not true may result in harm to the firm’s prospects 

management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among the firm’s clients the failure or perceived failure to adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions and may do so in the future and could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the firm as well as cause serious harm to the firm’s reputation 

 

actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the firm’s reputation for example the role played by financial services firms during the financial crisis including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the firm’s reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to its reputation could not adversely affect the firm’s earnings and results of operations or that damage to the firm’s reputation will not impair the firm’s ability to retain its existing or attract new customers investors and employees

 item 9a controls and procedures 

the internal control framework promulgated by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” “internal control — integrated framework” “coso 2013” provides guidance for designing implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness the firm used the coso 2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015  see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 174  

as of the end of the period covered by this report an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the firm’s management including its chairman and chief executive officer and its chief financial officer of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on that evaluation the chairman and chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective see exhibits 311 and 312 for the certification statements issued by the chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer 

the firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting nevertheless because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future for further information see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 174  there was no change in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the three months ended   december 31

the financial services industry has experienced consolidation and convergence in recent years as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial products and services have merged and in some cases failed this consolidation is expected to continue consolidation could result in competitors of jpmorgan chase gaining greater capital and other resources such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity it is likely that competition will become even more intense as the firm’s businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the firm 

supervision and regulation 

the firm is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the us as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the us in which the firm does business 

as a result of rulemaking following the enactment of the wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” and other regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in the us and abroad the firm is currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in regulation and such changes could have a significant impact on how the firm conducts business the firm continues to work diligently in assessing the regulatory changes it is facing and is devoting substantial resources to implementing all the new regulations while at the same time best meeting the needs and expectations of its 



part i 

customers clients and shareholders the combined effect of numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules present challenges and risks to the firm’s business and operations given the current status of the regulatory developments the firm cannot currently quantify the possible effects on its business and operations of all of the significant changes that are currently underway for more information see risk factors on pages 8–17  

financial holding company 

consolidated supervision by the federal reserve  as a bank holding company “bhc” and a financial holding company jpmorgan chase is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” the federal reserve acts as an “umbrella regulator” and certain of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries for example jpmorgan chase’s national bank subsidiaries such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” and with respect to certain matters by the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” nonbank subsidiaries such as the firm’s us brokerdealers are subject to supervision and regulation by the securities and exchange commission “sec” and with respect to certain futuresrelated and swapsrelated activities by the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” see securities and brokerdealer regulation investment management regulation and derivatives regulation below 

as a result of the doddfrank act jpmorgan chase is or will become subject to among other things significantly revised and expanded regulation and supervision additional limitations on the way it conducts its businesses and heightened capital and liquidity requirements in addition the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” which was created by the doddfrank act has rulemaking enforcement and examination authority over jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries with respect to federal consumer protection laws 

scope of permissible business activities the bank holding company act generally restricts bhcs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities financial holding companies generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for bhcs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding companies including requirements that the financial holding company and each of its us depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as “well capitalized” and “well managed” the broader range of permissible activities for financial holding companies includes underwriting dealing and making markets in 

 

securities and making merchant banking investments in nonfinancial companies 

the federal reserve has the authority to limit a financial holding company’s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible if the financial holding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements the federal reserve may also impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies persist federal regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies in addition a financial holding company must obtain federal reserve approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the us and internationally as further described under regulation of acquisitions below 

activities restrictions under the volcker rule section 619 of the doddfrank act the “volcker rule” prohibits banking entities including the firm from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities subject to exceptions for underwriting marketmaking riskmitigating hedging and certain other activities in addition the volcker rule limits the sponsorship and investment in “covered funds” as defined by the rule and imposes limits on certain transactions between the firm and its sponsored funds see investment management regulation below the volcker rule requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the volcker rule including in order to distinguish permissible from impermissible risktaking activities the measurement and monitoring of seven metrics the firm has taken significant steps to comply with the volcker rule however given the complexity of the new framework and the fact that many provisions of the rule still require further regulatory guidance the full impact of the volcker rule is still uncertain and will ultimately depend on the interpretation and implementation by the five regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight 

capital and liquidity requirements the federal reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for the firm and evaluates its compliance with such capital requirements the occ establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for the firm’s national banking subsidiaries for more information about the applicable requirements relating to riskbased capital and leverage in the us under the basel committee’s most recent capital framework “basel iii” see regulatory capital on pages 146–153  and note 28 it is likely that the banking supervisors will continue to refine and enhance the basel iii capital framework for financial institutions recent proposals being contemplated by the basel committee 



include among others revisions to market risk capital for trading books credit risk capital calculations the measurement methodology to calculate counterparty credit risk and revisions to the securitization framework after a proposal is finalized by the basel committee us banking regulators would then need to propose requirements applicable to us financial institutions under basel iii bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” and the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” for additional information on these ratios see liquidity risk management on pages 156–160  

stress tests pursuant to the doddfrank act the federal reserve has adopted supervisory stress tests for large bank holding companies including jpmorgan chase which form part of the federal reserve’s annual comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” framework under the framework the firm must conduct semiannual companyrun stress tests and in addition must submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the firm and the federal reserve in reviewing the firm’s capital plan the federal reserve will consider both quantitative and qualitative factors qualitative assessments will include among other things the comprehensiveness of the plan the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan and the extent to which the firm has satisfied certain supervisory matters related to the firm’s processes and analyses moreover the firm is required to receive a notice of nonobjection from the federal reserve before taking capital actions such as paying dividends implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the occ requires jpmorgan chase bank na to perform separate similar annual stress tests the firm publishes on its website each year in july the results of its midyear stress tests under the firm’s internallydeveloped “severely adverse” scenario and in march the results of its and its two primary subsidiary banks annual ccar stress tests under the federal reserve’s “severely adverse” scenario commencing with the 2016 ccar the annual ccar submission will be due april 5 th  results will be published by the federal reserve by june 30 th  with disclosures of results by bhcs to follow within 15 days also commencing in 2016 the midcycle capital stress test submissions will be due october 5 th  and bhcs will publish results by november 4 th  

for additional information on the firm’s ccar see regulatory capital on pages 146–153  

enhanced prudential standards the doddfrank act established a new oversight body the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” which among other things recommends prudential standards reporting and disclosure requirements to the federal reserve for systemically important financial institutions bhcs with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets such as jpmorgan chase became automatically subject to the heightened prudential standards the federal reserve has adopted several rules to 

 

implement certain of the heightened prudential standards contemplated by the doddfrank act including final rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject bank holding companies beginning january 1 2015 the rules require bhcs with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards including a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days and increased involvement by boards of directors in risk management several additional proposed rules are still being considered including rules relating to singlecounterparty credit limits and an “early remediation” framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses 

risk reporting in january 2013 the basel committee issued new regulations relating to risk aggregation and reporting under these regulations the banking institution’s risk governance framework must encompass riskdata aggregation and reporting and data aggregation must be highly automated and allow for minimal manual intervention the regulations also impose higher standards for the accuracy comprehensiveness granularity and timely distribution of data reporting and call for regular supervisory review of the banking institution’s risk aggregation and reporting global systemically important banks “gsibs” will be required to comply with these new standards by january 1 2016 

orderly liquidation authority and other financial stability measures as a bhc with assets of 50 billion or more the firm is required to submit annually to the federal reserve and the fdic a plan for resolution under the bankruptcy code in the event of material distress or failure a “resolution plan” the fdic also requires each insured depositary institution with 50 billion or more in assets to provide a resolution plan for more information about the firm’s resolution plan see risk factors on pages 8–17  in addition under the doddfrank act certain financial companies including jpmorgan chase and certain of its subsidiaries can be subjected to resolution under a new “orderly liquidation authority” the us treasury secretary in consultation with the president of the united states must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations and action must be recommended by the fdic and the federal reserve absent such actions the firm as a bhc would remain subject to resolution under the bankruptcy code in december 2013 the fdic released its “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of systemically important financial institutions under the orderly liquidation authority this strategy seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of the bhc open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority 

regulators in the us and abroad continue to be focused on measures to address “too big to fail” and to provide safeguards so that if a large financial institution does fail it can be resolved without the use of public funds higher 



part i 

capital surcharges on gsibs requirements recently introduced by the federal reserve that certain large bank holding companies maintain a minimum amount of longterm debt to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms and the recently adopted isda protocol relating to the “closeout” of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large crossborder financial institution are examples of initiatives to address “too big to fail” for further information on the potential impact of the gsib framework and total loss absorbing capacity “tlac” see regulatory capital on pages 146–153  and on the isda closeout protocol see derivatives regulation below 

holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries  jpmorgan chase  co is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when the firm might otherwise determine not to provide it 

regulation of acquisitions financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5 of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank in addition the doddfrank act restricts acquisitions by financial companies if as a result of the acquisition the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10 of the total liabilities of all financial companies this could have the effect of allowing a nonus financial company to grow to hold significantly more than 10 of the us market without exceeding the concentration limit in addition under the doddfrank act the firm must provide written notice to the federal reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over 10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in nature”

crossguarantee  an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with such institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution 

prompt corrective action and early remediation  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent bhc such as jpmorgan chase  co based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary in certain instances the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary 

occ heightened standards the occ has released final regulations and guidelines establishing heightened standards for large banks the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks while the bank may use certain components of the parent company’s risk governance framework the framework must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management purposes the bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for approving the bank’s risk governance framework providing active oversight of the bank’s risktaking activities and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework

private equity funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment manager investment advisor or sponsor 

dividend restrictions federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na see note 27 for the amount of dividends that the firm’s principal bank subsidiaries could pay at january 1 2015 to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators 

in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the occ the federal reserve and the fdic have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including jpmorgan chase and its bank and bhc subsidiaries if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization 

depositor preference  under federal law the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities including the fdic have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including public noteholders and depositors in nonus offices as a result such persons could receive substantially less than the depositors in us offices of the depository institution the uk prudential regulation authority the “pra” has issued a proposal that may require the firm to either obtain equal treatment for uk depositors or “subsidiarize” in the uk in september 2013 the fdic issued a final rule which clarifies that foreign deposits are considered deposits under the fdia only if they are also payable in the us

escrow standards and requirements for higherpriced mortgages other areas of recent focus include “addon” products matters involving consumer populations considered vulnerable by the cfpb such as students and the furnishing of credit scores to individuals the cfpb has been focused on automobile dealer discretionary interest rate markups and on holding the firm and other purchasers of such contracts “indirect lenders” responsible under the ecoa for statistical disparities in markups charged by the dealers to borrowers of different races or ethnicities the firm has adopted programs to address these risks including an active dealer education monitoring and review programs

part i 

item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chase ’s financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm 

regulatory risk 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and the firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the firm is subject 

as a global financial services firm jpmorgan chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the us and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the us in which the firm does business these laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the firm does business and can restrict the scope of the firm’s existing businesses limit the firm’s ability to expand the products and services that it offers or make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers 

the financial services industry continues to experience an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision and such changes could have a significant impact on how the firm conducts business significant and comprehensive new legislation and regulations affecting the financial services industry have been adopted or proposed in recent years both in the us and globally the firm continues to make appropriate adjustments to its business and operations legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management policies procedures and controls to comply with these new laws and regulations however the cumulative effect of all of the new and proposed legislation and regulations on the firm’s business operations and profitability remains uncertain 

the recent legislative and regulatory developments as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the us and in the other countries in which the firm operates and any required changes to the firm’s business or operations resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue for the firm impose additional compliance and other costs on the firm or otherwise reduce the firm’s profitability limit the products and services that the firm offers or its ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging require the firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses affect the value of assets that the firm holds require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products or otherwise adversely affect the firm’s businesses 

nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the us which could create increased compliance and other costs and adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s business operations or profitability 

 

there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in different countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example recent eu legislative and regulatory initiatives including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions the proposed separation of trading activities from core banking services mandatory onexchange trading position limits and reporting rules for derivatives conduct of business requirements and restrictions on compensation could require the firm to make significant modifications to its nonus business operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements these differences in implemented or proposed nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the us which could subject the firm to increased compliance and legal costs as well as higher operational capital and liquidity costs all of which could have an adverse effect on the firm’s business results of operations and profitability 

expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of jpmorgan chase’s businesses will continue to increase the firm’s costs and risks 

the firm’s businesses and operations are increasingly subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny the firm has paid significant fines or has provided significant monetary and other relief to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies in addition the firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject including enhancing its procedures and controls expanding its risk and control functions within its lines of business investing in technology and hiring significant numbers of additional risk control and compliance personnel all of which have increased the firm’s operational and compliance costs 

if the firm fails to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements to which it is subject or more generally to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements pay additional fines penalties or judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses the extent of the firm’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could in some cases substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the firm has established for such matters 

the firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than with informal supervisory action 



in addition certain regulators have announced policies or taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions which make it more likely that the firm and other financial institutions may be required to admit wrongdoing in connection with settling such matters such admissions can lead to among other things greater exposure in civil litigation and reputational harm 

finally us government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have increasingly sought and obtained resolutions that include criminal pleas from those institutions such resolutions can have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution including loss of customers and business and absent the forbearance of or the granting of waivers by applicable regulators the inability to offer certain products or services or operate certain businesses for a period of time  

requirements for the orderly resolution of the firm under the doddfrank act could require jpmorgan chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses or make costly changes to its capital or funding structure 

under title i of the doddfrank act “title i” and federal reserve and fdic rules the firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the federal reserve and the fdic a detailed plan for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its subsidiaries under the us bankruptcy code or other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure in july 2014 the firm submitted its third title i resolution plan to the federal reserve and fdic the “2014 plan” in august 2014 the federal reserve and the fdic announced the completion of their reviews of the second round of title i resolution plans submitted by eleven large complex banking organizations the “first wave filers” in 2013 including the firm’s title i resolution plan submitted in 2013 the “2013 plan” although the agencies noted some improvements from the original plans submitted by the first wave filers in 2012 the agencies also jointly identified specific shortcomings with the 2013 resolution plans including the firm’s 2013 plan that will need to be addressed in 2015 submissions if not already addressed in the firm’s 2014 plan in addition the fdic board of directors determined under title i that the 2013 resolution plans submitted by the first wave filers including the firm’s 2013 plan are not credible and do not facilitate an orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code although the federal reserve board did not make such a determination the federal reserve board determined that the first wave filers must take immediate action to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 submissions 

if the federal reserve board and the fdic were to jointly determine that the firm’s title i resolution plan or any future update of that plan is not credible and the firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements on the firm or 

 

restrictions on growth activities or operations of the firm and could require the firm to restructure reorganize or divest businesses legal entities operational systems andor intercompany transactions in ways that could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations and strategy in addition in order to develop a title i resolution plan that the federal reserve board and fdic determine is credible the firm may need to take actions to restructure intercompany and external activities which could result in increased funding or operational costs 

in addition to the firm’s plan for orderly resolution the firm’s resolution plan also recommends to the federal reserve and the fdic its proposed optimal strategy to resolve the firm under the special resolution procedure provided in title ii of the doddfrank act “title ii” the firm’s recommendation for its optimal title ii strategy would involve a “single point of entry” recapitalization model in which the fdic would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for jpmorgan chase transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the firm’s business principally the stock of jpmorgan chase  co’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries to the bridge entity recapitalize those businesses by contributing some or all of such intercompany claims to the capital of such subsidiaries and by exchanging debt claims against jpmorgan chase  co for equity in the bridge entity the federal reserve is also expected to propose rules regarding the minimum levels of unsecured longterm debt and other loss absorbing capacity that bank holding companies would be required to have issued and outstanding as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalization issuing debt in the amounts that would be required under these proposed rules could lead to increased funding costs for the firm in addition if the firm were to be resolved under its recommended title ii strategy no assurance can be given that the value of the stock of the bridge entity distributed to the holders of debt obligations of jpmorgan chase  co would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or part of the principal amount of and interest on the debt obligations for which such stock was exchanged 

market risk 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by us and international financial market and economic conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions including the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates and currency and commodities prices investor sentiment events that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit the economic effects of natural disasters severe weather conditions outbreaks of hostilities or terrorism monetary policies and actions taken by the federal reserve 



part i 

and other central banks and the health of the us and global economies these conditions can affect the firm’s businesses both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the firm’s clients and customers 

in the firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses the abovementioned factors can affect the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its clients and customers and therefore the revenue that the firm receives from fees and commissions as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the firm 

the firm generally maintains extensive marketmaking positions in the fixed income currency commodities credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients the revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors including the firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets interest rate and credit spreads and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions certain of the firm’s marketmaking positions could be adversely affected by the lack of pricing transparency or liquidity which will be influenced by many of these factors the firm anticipates that revenue relating to its marketmaking businesses will continue to experience volatility which will affect the firm’s ability to realize returns from such activities and could adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the fees that the firm earns for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets that the firm manages or holds in custody which in turn could affect the firm’s revenue macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the firm’s funds or accounts 

changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the firm earns from net interest income a low interest rate environment has and may continue to have an adverse effect on certain of the firm’s businesses by compressing net interest margins reducing the amounts that the firm earns on its investment securities portfolio or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights “msr” asset thereby reducing the firm’s net interest income and other revenues conversely increasing or high interest rates may result in increased funding costs lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the availableforsale investment securities portfolio to the extent that the firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higheryielding assets thereby adversely affecting the firm’s revenues and capital levels 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by us domestic economic conditions including us interest 

 

rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies if the current positive trends in the us economy are not sustained this could diminish demand for the products and services of the firm’s consumer businesses or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment could lead to an increase in mortgage credit card auto student and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce the firm’s earnings 

widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to firmspecific events and circumstances but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in the firm’s credit spreads will impact positively or negatively the firm’s earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value 

sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets including loan and derivatives may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets adversely affect the firm’s profitability capital or liquidity or increase the firm’s funding costs sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence which could lead to lower client activity and decreased feebased income for the firm 

credit risk 

the financial condition of jpmorgan chase’s customers clients and counterparties particularly other financial institutions could adversely affect the firm 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of marketmaking trading clearing counterparty or other relationships the firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds investment managers and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose the firm to credit risk and in some cases disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client in recent years the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated antitrust or anticompetition laws by colluding to manipulate markets prices or indices 

the firm is a market leader in providing clearing and custodial services and also acts as a clearing and custody bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market including the us triparty repurchase transaction market many of these services expose the firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client a central counterparty “ccp” or another market participant 



as part of providing clearing services the firm is a member of a number of ccps and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members as a clearing member the firm is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral in its role as custodian bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market the firm can be exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients if a client to which the firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent the firm may become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties including one or more ccps the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations all of such events can increase the firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the firm declines in value 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity the firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to the firm further disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and the firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral 

concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses 

jpmorgan chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions as a result the firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks the firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful 

in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the firm’s inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of its positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce the firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but may also increase the level of riskweighted assets on the firm’s balance sheet thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the firm’s businesses 

liquidity risk 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses some potential conditions that could impair the firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or 

 

are otherwise experiencing disruption unforeseen cash or capital requirements including among others commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in the firm or financial markets in general these conditions may be caused by events over which the firm has little or no control the widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages credit card receivables and other assets during that time and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future 

if the firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding such as bank deposits is reduced the firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability in addition regulations regarding the amount and types of securities that the firm may use to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements may also affect the firm’s cost of funding 

as a holding company jpmorgan chase  co relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and consequently its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends loans or other payments several of jpmorgan chase  co’s principal subsidiaries are subject to dividend distribution capital adequacy or liquidity coverage requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments limitations in the payments that jpmorgan chase  co receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations 

regulators in some countries in which the firm has operations have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to conduct certain businesses through separate subsidiaries in those countries and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries if adopted these requirements could hinder the firm’s ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner 

reductions in jpmorgan chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the firm 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies rating agencies evaluate both general and firm and industryspecific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution including economic and geopolitical trends regulatory developments future profitability risk management practices legal expenses assumptions surrounding government support and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries although the firm closely 



part i 

monitors and manages to the extent it is able factors that could influence its credit ratings there is no assurance that the firm’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

furthermore a reduction in the firm’s credit ratings could reduce the firm’s access to capital markets materially increase the cost of issuing securities trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted contractually or otherwise to do business with or lend to the firm thereby curtailing the firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability in addition any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries and as a result could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future 

legal risk 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties actions currently pending against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm which could materially and adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm to the firm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that the firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations 

in addition and as noted above the firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions as the regulators and other government agencies continue to examine the operations of the firm and its subsidiaries there is no assurance that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the firm in the future a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the us or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in nonus jurisdictions these and other initiatives from us and nonus governmental authorities and officials may subject the firm to further judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause the firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of which could harm the firm’s reputation or lead to 

 

higher operational costs thereby reducing the firm’s profitability 

other business risks 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic monetary and political developments in the us and around the world 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various us and nonus regulatory authorities and agencies the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the us and the return earned on those loans and investments changes in federal reserve policies as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of nonus central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies such as “pegging” the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others are beyond the firm’s control and may be difficult to predict and consequently unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the firm’s activities and results of operations 

the firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and marketmaking in securities loans and other obligations of companies worldwide these risks include among others negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions or the risk of loss from unfavorable political legal or other developments including social or political instability in the countries in which such companies operate as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below 

several of the firm’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of us and nonus governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities these activities can expose the firm to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputational risks including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations 

further various countries in which the firm operates or invests or in which the firm may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions the ongoing crisis in russia and impact of sanctions coupled with sharp oil price declines a potential slowdown in the macroeconomic prospects in china and concerns about potential economic weaknesses in the eurozone including the permanent resolution of the greek “bailout” program could undermine investor confidence and affect the operating environment in 2015 in some cases concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to “market contagion” affecting other countries in the same 



region or beyond the region accordingly it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries even in countries in which the firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities will adversely affect the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political social and economic factors and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks 

some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than the us and other developed markets in which the firm currently operates some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation or low or negative growth among other negative conditions or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment in addition these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in and may in the future lead to social unrest general strikes and demonstrations outbreaks of hostilities overthrow of incumbent governments terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord all of which can adversely affect the firm’s operations or investments in such countries political social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the firm conducts its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations 

less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the firm’s operations in those countries including among others the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions 

revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations as well as due to governmental actions including expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can affect and in the past 

 

conditions of these types have affected the firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries including the firm’s operations in the us as a result any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the firm’s business and results of operations 

conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that the firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems in addition the firm can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses outside the us to comply with us anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations 

jpmorgan chase relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees and those of third parties and certain failures of such systems or misconduct by such employees could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are dependent on the firm’s ability to process record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis the firm’s front and backoffice trading systems similarly rely on their access to and on the functionality of the operating systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems central counterparties securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies if the firm’s financial accounting trading or other data processing systems or the operating systems of third parties on which the firm’s businesses are dependent are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially and adversely affected the firm is similarly dependent on its employees the firm could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firm’s operations or systems in addition when the firm changes processes or introduces new products and services and new remote connectivity solutions including internet and mobile banking services the firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes any of these occurrences could diminish the firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients and customers increased operating expenses higher litigation costs including fines and sanctions reputational damage regulatory 



part i 

intervention or weaker competitive standing any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm 

third parties with which the firm does business as well as retailers and other third parties with which the firm’s customers do business can also be sources of operational risk to the firm particularly where activities of customers are beyond the firm’s security and control systems such as through the use of the internet personal smart phones and other mobile services security breaches affecting the firm’s customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties may require the firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the firm or its customers thereby increasing the firm’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction 

if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the firm’s possession were to be mishandled or misused the firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where for example such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either through the fault of the firm’s systems employees or counterparties or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties 

the firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the firm’s control which may include for example security breaches as discussed further below electrical or telecommunications outages failures of computer servers or other damage to the firm’s property or assets natural disasters or severe weather conditions health emergencies or pandemics or events arising from local or largerscale political events including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts jpmorgan chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption while the firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the firm or its customers and clients any failures or disruptions of the firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the firm to losses or liability or require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption as well as by exposing the firm to litigation regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance 

a breach in the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems could disrupt its businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage its reputation and 

 

create significant financial and legal exposure for the firm 

although jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the firm’s computer systems software networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to the firm and its customers and clients there is no assurance that all of the firm’s security measures will provide absolute security jpmorgan chase and other companies have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means a cyberattack against the firm in 2014 resulted in customer and internal data of the firm being compromised the firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses and has also experienced several significant distributed denialofservice attacks from technically sophisticated and wellresourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services 

despite the firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems it is possible that the firm may not be able to anticipate detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties outside the firm such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers thirdparty service providers or other users of the firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the firm’s data or that of its customers or clients these risks may increase in the future as the firm continues to increase its mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expands its internal usage of webbased products and applications 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the firm’s systems could cause serious negative consequences for the firm including significant disruption of the firm’s operations misappropriation of confidential information of the firm or that of its customers or damage to computers or systems of the firm and those of its customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to the firm or to its customers loss of confidence in the firm’s security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure and harm to the firm’s reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on the firm 



risk management 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the firm thereby resulting in losses 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the firm the firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which the firm is subject however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to the firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist or develop in the future risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified any lapse in the firm’s risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the firm’s risk management framework governance procedures or practices could individually or in the aggregate cause unexpected losses for the firm materially and adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency attract heightened regulatory scrutiny expose the firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings subject the firm to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

the firm’s products including loans leases lending commitments derivatives trading account assets and assets heldforsale as well as cash management and clearing activities expose the firm to credit risk as one of the nation’s largest lenders the firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties and the credit quality of the firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings the firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure including unfunded lendingrelated commitments the firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the firm in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to the firm’s financial results and condition and require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations as is the case with any such assessments there is always the possibility that the firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

jpmorgan chase’s marketmaking businesses may expose the firm to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause the firm to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or 

 

pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative certain of the firm’s derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the firm does not own if the firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays which could damage the firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business in addition in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis the firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default the firm may be exposed to market and operational losses in particular disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise which could force the firm to incur unexpected costs including transaction legal and litigation costs and impair the firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products 

in a difficult or less liquid market environment the firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for the firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants 

many of the firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by the firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the firm’s risk management strategies causing the firm to incur losses 

many of the models used by the firm are subject to review not only by the firm’s model risk function but also by the firm’s regulators in order that the firm may utilize such models in connection with the firm’s calculations of market risk riskweighted assets “rwa” credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under the advanced approach of basel iii the firm may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses if such models do not receive approval by its regulators 

in addition the firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the firm these requirements apply to the firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and more specifically under certain of the consent orders to which the firm is subject the firm has incurred and expects to 



part i 

incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships failure by the firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could result in potential liability to clients and customers fines penalties or judgments imposed by the firm’s regulators increased operating expenses and harm to the firm’s reputation any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm 

lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations profitability or reputation 

there can be no assurance that the firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition restrict its ability to access the capital markets require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies expose the firm to regulatory or legal proceedings subject it to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

other risks 

the financial services industry is highly competitive and jpmorgan chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the firm expects that competition in the us and global financial services industry will continue to be intense competitors of the firm include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks hedge funds commodity trading companies private equity firms insurance companies mutual fund companies investment managers credit card companies mortgage banking companies trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading and payment processing the firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the firm’s products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share increased competition also 

 

may require the firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive these investments may increase expense or may require the firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions the firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations 

competitors of the firm’s nonus wholesale businesses are typically subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes for example the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the doddfrank act including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the volcker rule have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the us and may not be implemented into law in most countries the more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to us financial services institutions such as jpmorgan chase can put the firm at a competitive disadvantage to its nonus competitors including prohibiting the firm from engaging in certain transactions imposing higher capital requirements on the firm making the firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the firm’s cost structure for providing certain products all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the firm’s wholesale businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are the firm’s most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense the firm endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees the firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent augmented from time to time by external hires to provide continuity of succession for the firm’s operating committee including the chief executive officer position and senior positions below the operating committee the firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a nextlevel role in addition the firm’s board of directors is deeply involved in succession planning including review of the succession plans for the chief executive officer and the members of the operating committee if for any reason the firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees including successors to the chief executive officer or members of the operating committee the firm’s performance including its competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if incorrect could cause unexpected losses in the future 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the us “us gaap” jpmorgan chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial 



statements including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation among other items certain of the firm’s financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities availableforsale securities certain loans msrs structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the firm’s financial statements where quoted market prices are not available the firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment if assumptions or estimates underlying the firm’s financial statements are incorrect the firm may experience material losses 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could damage its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to the firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers investors and employees damage to the firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the firm’s business and prospects harm to the firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct security breaches compliance failures litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations the firm’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure of an affiliate jointventurer or merchant banking portfolio company or a vendor or other third party with which the firm does business to comply with laws or regulations in addition a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality to treat customers and clients fairly or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations can result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and harm to the firm’s reputation adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding the firm whether or not true may result in harm to the firm’s prospects actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the firm’s reputation for example the role played by financial services firms during the financial crisis including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the firm’s reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the firm’s earnings and results of operations or that damage to the firm’s reputation will not impair the firm’s ability to retain its existing or attract new customers investors and employees 

 

management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among the firm’s clients the failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the firm or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions as well as cause serious reputational harm to the firm

 item 9a controls and procedures 

in may 2013 the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso issued its updated “internal control  integrated framework 2013” the 2013 framework which provides guidance for designing implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness updates the original coso framework which was published in 1992 the firm used the 2013 coso framework to assess the effectiveness of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 170  

as of the end of the period covered by this report an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the firm’s management including its chairman and chief executive officer and its chief financial officer of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on that evaluation the chairman and chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective see exhibits 311 and 312 for the certification statements issued by the chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer 

the firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting nevertheless because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future for further information see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 170  there was no change in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the three months ended   december 31 2014  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the firm’s internal control over financial reporting

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chase ’s financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm 

regulatory risk 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and the firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject 

as a global financial services firm jpmorgan chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the united states and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the united states in which the firm does business these laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the firm does business and can restrict the scope of the firm’s existing businesses and limit the firm’s ability to expand its product offerings or to pursue acquisitions or can make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers 

the firm is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision and such changes could have a significant impact on how the firm conducts business significant and comprehensive new legislation and regulations affecting the financial services industry have been adopted or proposed in recent years both in the united states and globally most notably the doddfrank act in the united states certain key regulations such as the volcker rule and the us implementation of the basel iii capital standards have now been adopted and the firm continues to make appropriate adjustments to its business and operations legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management policies procedures and controls to  comply with these and other new laws and regulations however us and other regulators continue to develop propose and adopt rules and propose new regulatory initiatives so the cumulative effect of all of the new legislation and regulations on the firm’s business and operations remains uncertain in addition there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in different countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business nonus regulations and 

 

initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the united states which could create increased compliance and other costs for the firm and adversely affect its business operations or profitability 

these recent legislative and regulatory developments as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the united states and in the other countries in which the firm operates could result in a significant loss of revenue for the firm impose additional costs on the firm or otherwise reduce the firm’s profitability limit the firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging require the firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses affect the value of assets that the firm holds require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products or otherwise adversely affect the firm’s businesses 

expanded regulatory oversight of jpmorgan chase’s businesses will increase the firm’s compliance costs and risks and may reduce the profitability of those businesses 

in recent years the firm has entered into several consent orders with its banking regulators and settlements with various governmental agencies including the consent orders entered into in april 2011 relating to the firm’s residential mortgage servicing foreclosure and loss mitigation activities the february 2012 global settlement with federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages the consent orders entered into in january 2013 relating to the firm’s bank secrecy actantimoney laundering policies procedures and controls and to chief investment office risk management and control functions as well as trading activities the consent orders entered into september 2013 concerning oversight of third parties operational processes and control functions related to credit card collections litigation practices and to billing practices for credit monitoring products formerly offered by the firm the settlements in november 2013 of certain repurchase representation and warranty claims by a group of institutional investors and with the us department of justice several other federal agencies and several state attorneys general relating to certain residential mortgagebacked securitization activities of the firm bear stearns and washington mutual the deferred prosecution agreement entered into in january 2014 with the us department of justice and related agreements with the occ and the financial crimes enforcement network fincen relating to bernard l madoff investment securities llc and the firms aml compliance program and the february   2014 settlement entered into with several federal government agencies relating to the firm’s participation in certain federal mortgage insurance programs these consent orders and settlements require the firm among other things to remediate specified deficiencies in certain controls and operational processes in some cases to engage internal or external personnel to review past transactions or to monitor the extent to which cited lapses 



part i 

have been addressed and to furnish its regulators with periodic reports concerning the firm’s progress in meeting the requirements of the orders and settlements the firm has also paid significant fines and penalties or provided monetary and other relief in connection with many of these actions and settlements 

the firm is devoting substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of these consent orders and settlements including comprehensive enhancements to its procedures and controls the expansion of risk and control functions within each line of business investments in technology and the hiring of significant numbers of additional risk control and compliance personnel all of which has increased the firm’s operational and compliance costs in addition to these enforcement actions the firm is experiencing heightened regulatory oversight of its compliance with applicable laws and regulations particularly with respect to its consumer businesses the firm expects that such regulatory scrutiny will continue and that regulators will continue to take formal enforcement action rather than taking informal supervisory actions more frequently than they have done historically 

if the firm fails to successfully address the requirements of the consent orders the deferred prosecution agreement and the other regulatory settlements and enforcement actions to which it is subject or more generally to effectively enhance its risk and control procedures and processes to meet heightened expectations by its regulators it may continue to face a greater number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions and litigation thereby increasing its costs associated with responding to or defending such actions and it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements pay additional fines penalties or judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses which could adversely affect the firm’s operations and in turn its financial results in addition further regulatory inquiries investigations and actions as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting the firm’s businesses and any required changes to the firm’s business operations resulting from these developments could result in significant loss of revenue limit the products or services the firm offers require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products impose additional compliance costs on the firm cause harm to the firm’s reputation or otherwise adversely affect the firm’s businesses 

under the firm’s resolution plan required to be submitted by the doddfrank act resolution provisions holders of the firm’s debt obligations are at clear risk of loss in any resolution proceedings 

in october 2013 jpmorgan chase submitted to the federal reserve and the fdic its annual update to its plan for resolution of the firm the firm’s resolution plan includes strategies to resolve the firm under the bankruptcy code and also recommends to the fdic and the federal reserve 

 

the firm’s proposed optimal strategy to resolve the firm under the special resolution procedure provided in title ii of the doddfrank act “title ii” 

the firm’s recommendation for its optimal title ii strategy would involve a “single point of entry” recapitalization model in which the fdic would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for jpmorgan chase transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the firm’s business principally the stock of jpmorgan chase  co’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries to the bridge entity recapitalize those businesses by contributing some or all of such intercompany claims to the capital of such subsidiaries and by exchanging debt claims against jpmorgan chase  co for equity in the bridge entity if the firm were to be resolved under this strategy no assurance can be given that the value of the stock of the bridge entity distributed to the holders of debt obligations of jpmorgan chase  co would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or part of the principal amount of and interest on the debt obligations for which such stock was exchanged 

market risk 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by us and international financial market and economic conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions including the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates and currency and commodities prices investor sentiment events that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit the economic effects of natural disasters several weather conditions acts of war or terrorism monetary policies and actions taken by the federal reserve and other central banks and the health of us or international economies 

in the firm’s wholesale businesses the abovementioned factors can affect transactions involving the firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses the realization of cash returns from its private equity business the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its customers and therefore the revenue that the firm receives from commissions and spreads and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the firm 

the firm generally maintains extensive marketmaking positions in the fixed income currency commodities and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients the firm may have marketmaking positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity the revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors including the firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets credit spreads and 



availability of liquidity in the capital markets all of which are affected by economic and market conditions the firm anticipates that revenue relating to its marketmaking and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such activities and that this could materially adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the fees that the firm earns for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets that the firm manages or holds in custody which in turn could affect the firm’s revenue macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the firm’s funds or accounts 

changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the firm earns from net interest income a low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of the firm’s businesses by compressing net interest margins reducing the amounts that the firm earns on its investment securities portfolio or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights “msr” asset thereby reducing the firm’s net interest income and other revenues 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions including us interest rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies if the current positive trends in the us economy are not sustained this could diminish demand for the products and services of the firm’s consumer businesses or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment could lead to an increase in mortgage credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce the firm’s earnings 

widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to firmspecific events and circumstances but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in the firm’s credit spreads will impact positively or negatively the firm’s earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value 

finally adverse economic and financial market conditions in specific countries or regions can have significant adverse effects on the firm’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity for example during the recent eurozone debt crisis concerns about the possibility of one or more sovereign debt defaults significant bank failures or defaults andor the exit of one or more countries from the european monetary union resulted in among other things declines in market liquidity a contraction of 

 

available credit and diminished economic growth and business confidence in the eurozone there are continuing concerns as to the ultimate financial effectiveness of the assistance measures taken to date and the extent to which the austerity measures may exacerbate high unemployment and test the social and political stability of weaker economies in the eurozone the firm’s business and results of operations can be adversely affected both by localized economic crises in parts of the world where the firm does business or when regional economic turmoil causes deterioration of global economic conditions 

credit risk 

the financial condition of jpmorgan chase’s customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect the firm 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of marketmaking trading clearing counterparty or other relationships the firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds investment managers and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose the firm to credit risk and in some cases disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client 

the firm is a market leader in providing clearing and custodial services and also acts as a clearing and custody bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market including the us triparty repurchase transaction market many of these services expose the firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client a central counterparty “ccp” or another market participant 

as part of providing clearing services the firm is a member of a number of ccps and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members as a clearing member the firm is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral in its role as custodian bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market the firm can be exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients if a client to whom the firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent the firm may become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties including one or more ccp’s the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations all of such events can increase the firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the firm declines in value 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity the firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to the firm further disputes with obligors as 



part i 

to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity periods of illiquidity could produce losses if the firm is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral 

concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses 

jpmorgan chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions as a result the firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks the firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful 

in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the firm’s inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of its positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce the firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on the firm’s balance sheet thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the firm’s businesses 

liquidity risk 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses some potential conditions that could impair the firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption unforeseen cash or capital requirements including among others commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in the firm or financial markets in general these conditions may be caused by events over which the firm has little or no control the widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages credit card receivables and other assets during that time and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future 

if the firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding such as bank deposits are reduced the firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability 

as a holding company jpmorgan chase  co relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and 

 

consequently its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends loans or other payments several of jpmorgan chase  co’s principal subsidiaries are subject to dividend distribution or capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments limitations in the payments that jpmorgan chase  co receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position 

some regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in countries in which they operate and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries if adopted these requirements could hinder the firm’s ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner 

reductions in the firm’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the firm 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its subsidiaries including jpmorgan chase bank na are currently rated by credit rating agencies in 2013 moody’s downgraded its ratings of jpmorgan chase  co and several other bank holding companies based on moody’s reassessment of its assumptions relating to implicit government support for such companies in addition as of yearend 2013 sp had jpmorgan chase  co on “negative” outlook indicating the possibility of a downgrade in ratings although the firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future furthermore the rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends regulatory developments rating uplift assumptions surrounding government support future profitability risk management practices and legal expenses all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions there is no assurance that any such downgrades from rating agencies if they affected the firm’s credit ratings would not occur at times of broader market instability when the firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

further a reduction in the firm’s credit ratings could reduce the firm’s access to debt markets materially increase the cost of issuing debt trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted contractually or otherwise to do business with or lend to the firm thereby curtailing the firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability in addition any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries and as a result could adversely affect the value of debt obligations that they have issued or may issue in the future  



legal risk 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties actions currently pending against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm which could materially adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm to the firm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that the firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations 

in addition and as noted above the firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions as the regulators and other government agencies continue to examine the operations of the firm and its bank subsidiaries there is no assurance that additional consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future these and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject the firm to further judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause the firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities all of which could lead to reputational issues or higher operational costs thereby reducing the firm’s revenue 

business and operational risks 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic monetary and political developments in the united states and around the world 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various us and nonus regulatory authorities and agencies the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the united states and the return earned on those loans and investments changes in federal reserve policies as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of nonus central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies are beyond the firm’s control and consequently the impact of changes in these policies on the firm’s activities and results of operations is difficult to predict 

the firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and marketmaking in securities of companies worldwide these risks include among others risk of loss from unfavorable political legal or other developments including social or political instability in the countries in which such companies operate as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below 

 

several of the firm’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of us and nonus governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities these activities can expose the firm to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputational risks including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations 

further various countries in which the firm operates or invests or in which the firm may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions in some cases concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can lead to “market contagion” to other countries in the same region or beyond the region accordingly it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries even in countries in which the firm does not conduct business or have operations will adversely affect the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s international strategy may be hindered by local political social and economic factors and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks 

jpmorgan chase has expanded and plans to continue to grow its international wholesale businesses in europemiddle eastafrica “emea” asiapacific and latin americacaribbean over time as part of its international strategy the firm seeks to provide a wider range of financial services to its clients that conduct business in those regions 

some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than the united states and other developed markets in which the firm currently operates some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation or low or negative growth among other negative conditions or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment in addition these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in and may in the future lead to social unrest general strikes and demonstrations outbreaks of hostilities overthrow of incumbent governments terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord all of which can adversely affect the firm’s operations or investments in such countries political social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the firm conducts its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations and there can be no assurance that the firm will be able to successfully execute its international strategy 



part i 

less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the firm’s operations in those countries including among others the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions 

revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations as well as due to governmental actions including expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can and has in the past affected the firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries including the firm’s operations in the united states as a result any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the firm’s business and results of operations 

conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that the firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems in addition the firm can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring its operations outside the united states to comply with us anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations 

jpmorgan chase’s commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the firm to significant cost and liability 

jpmorgan chase engages in the storage transportation marketing or trading of several commodities including metals agricultural products crude oil oil products natural gas electric power emission credits coal freight and related products and indices the firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing developing and trading emission reduction credits as a result of all of these 

 

activities the firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy commodities environmental and other governmental laws and regulations the firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity and to restrict some of the firm’s activities which could result in lower revenues from the firm’s commodities activities in addition the firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties furthermore liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations 

the firm’s commodities activities also further expose the firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events including natural disasters leaks spills explosions release of toxic substances fires accidents on land and at sea wars and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries loss of life property damage damage to the firm’s reputation and suspension of operations the firm’s commodities activities are also subject to disruptions many of which are outside of the firm’s control from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment transmission lines or other equipment or processes and the contractual failure of performance by thirdparty suppliers or service providers including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities the firm’s actions to mitigate its risks related to the abovementioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency in addition insurance covering some of these risks may not be available and the proceeds if any from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents as a result the firm’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events 

jpmorgan chase relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees and those of third parties and certain failures of such systems or misconduct by such employees could materially adversely affect the firm’s operations 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are dependent on the firm’s ability to process record and monitor a large number of complex transactions if the firm’s financial accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially adversely affected the firm is similarly dependent on its employees the firm could be materially adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firm’s operations or systems in addition as the firm changes processes or introduces new products and services the firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes any of these occurrences could diminish the firm’s ability to 



operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients increased operating expenses higher litigation costs including fines and sanctions reputational damage regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm 

third parties with which the firm does business as well as retailers and other third parties with which the firm’s customers do business can also be sources of operational risk to the firm including with respect to security breaches affecting such parties and breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties incidents of these types may require the firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the firm or its customers thereby increasing the firm’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction 

if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the firm’s possession were to be mishandled or misused the firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where for example such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either through the fault of the firm’s systems employees or counterparties or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 

the firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the firm’s control which may include for example security breaches as discussed further below electrical or telecommunications outages failures of computer servers or other damage to the firm’s property or assets natural disasters or severe weather conditions health emergencies or pandemics or events arising from local or larger scale political events including terrorist acts jpmorgan chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption while the firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the firm any failures or disruptions of the firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the firm to losses or liability or require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption as well as by exposing the firm to litigation regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance 

 

a breach in the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems could disrupt its businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the firm 

although jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the firm’s computer systems software networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to the firm and its customers there is no assurance that all of the firm’s security measures will provide absolute security jpmorgan chase and other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means in particular the firm has experienced several significant distributed denialofservice attacks from technically sophisticated and wellresourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services as well as data breaches due to cyberattacks which in certain instances have resulted in unauthorized access to customer data 

despite the firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems it is possible that the firm may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties outside the firm such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of the firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the firm’s data or that of its customers or clients these risks may increase in the future as the firm continues to increase its mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expands its internal usage of webbased products and applications 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the firm’s systems could cause serious negative consequences for the firm including significant disruption of the firm’s operations misappropriation of confidential information of the firm or that of its customers or damage to computers or systems of the firm and those of its customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to the firm or to its customers loss of confidence in the firm’s security measures customer dissatisfaction significant

litigation exposure and harm to the firm’s reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on the firm 

risk management 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the firm thereby resulting in losses 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the firm the firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which the firm is subject however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to the firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist or develop in the future risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified any lapse in the firm’s risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the firm’s risk management framework governance procedures or practices could individually or in the aggregate cause unexpected losses for the firm materially and adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency attract heightened regulatory scrutiny expose the firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings subject the firm to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

the firm’s products including loans leases lending commitments derivatives trading account assets and assets heldforsale as well as cash management and clearing activities expose the firm to credit risk as one of the nation’s largest lenders the firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties and the credit quality of the firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings the firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure including unfunded lending commitments the firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the firm in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to the firm’s financial results and condition and require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations as is the case with any such assessments there is always the possibility that the firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

jpmorgan chase’s marketmaking businesses may expose the firm to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause the firm to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa 

 

may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative certain of the firm’s derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities commodities or obligations that the firm does not own if the firm is unable to obtain such securities commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays which could damage the firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business in addition in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis the firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default the firm may be exposed to market and operational losses in particular disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise which could force the firm to incur unexpected costs including transaction legal and litigation costs and impair the firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products 

in a difficult or less liquid market environment the firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for the firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants 

many of the firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by the firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the firm’s risk management strategies causing the firm to incur losses 

many of the models used by the firm are subject to review not only by the firm’s model risk function but also by the firm’s regulators in order that the firm may utilize such models in connection with the firm’s calculations of market risk riskweighted assets “rwa” and credit risk rwa under the advanced approach of basel iii the firm may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses if such models do not receive approval by its regulators in addition there is no assurance that the amount of capital that the firm holds with respect to operational risk as derived from its operational risk capital model required under the basel iii capital standards will 



not be required to increase which may have the effect of reducing the firm’s profitability 

in addition the firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the firm these requirements apply to the firm both under general guidance issued by the banking regulators and more specifically under the consent order entered into by the firm relating to collections litigation practices the firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships failure by the firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could result in potential liability to clients and customers fines penalties or judgments imposed by the firm’s regulators increased operating expenses and harm to the firm’s reputation any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm 

lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations profitability or reputation 

there can be no assurance that the firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could not occur again any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition restrict its ability to access the capital markets require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies expose the firm to regulatory or legal proceedings subject it to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

other risks 

the financial services industry is highly competitive and jpmorgan chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as the financial services industry produces bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices 

competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks hedge funds commodity trading companies private equity firms insurance companies mutual fund companies investment managers credit card companies mortgage banking companies trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing 

 

companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading the firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the firm’s products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share increased competition also may require the firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive these investments may increase expense or may require the firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions the firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations 

competitors of the firm’s nonus wholesale businesses are typically subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes for example the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the doddfrank act including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the volcker rule and the derivatives “pushout” rules have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the united states and may not be implemented into law in most countries the more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to us financial services institutions such as jpmorgan chase can put the firm at a competitive disadvantage to its nonus competitors including prohibiting the firm from engaging in certain transactions making the firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the firm’s cost structure for providing certain products all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the firm’s wholesale businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the firm’s performance 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are the firm’s most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense the imposition on the firm or its employees of restrictions on executive compensation may adversely affect the firm’s ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees if the firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees the firm’s performance including its competitive position could be materially adversely affected 



part i 

jpmorgan chase’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if incorrect could cause unexpected losses in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states jpmorgan chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation among other items certain of the firm’s financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities availableforsale securities certain loans msrs private equity investments structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the firm’s financial statements where quoted market prices are not available the firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment if assumptions or estimates underlying the firm’s financial statements are incorrect the firm may experience material losses 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could damage its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to the firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers investors and employees damage to the firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the firm’s business and prospects harm to the firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct compliance failures litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations the firm’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure of an affiliate jointventurer or merchant banking portfolio company or a vendor or other third party with which the firm does business to comply with laws or regulations in addition a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly can result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and harm to the firm’s reputation adverse publicity regarding the firm whether or not true may result in harm to the firm’s prospects actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the firm’s reputation for example the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the firm’s reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the firm may need to incur to address the issues giving 

 

rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the firm’s earnings and results of operations 

management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among the firm’s clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the firm or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions as well as cause serious reputational harm to the firm

the firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting nevertheless because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase  lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future for further information see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 182  there was no change in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the three months ended   december 31 2013  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the firm’s internal control over financial reporting

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chase ’s financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm 

regulatory risk 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and the firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject 

as a global financial services firm jpmorgan chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the united states and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the united states in which the firm does business these laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the firm does business and can restrict the scope of its existing businesses and limit its ability to expand its product offerings or to pursue acquisitions or can make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers 

the us department of the treasury the fsoc the sec the cftc the federal reserve the occ the cfpb and the fdic are all engaged in extensive rulemaking mandated by the doddfrank act and a substantial amount of the rulemaking remains to be done as a result the complete impact of the doddfrank act on the firm’s business operations and earnings remains uncertain certain aspects of the doddfrank act and such rulemaking are discussed in more detail below for further information see supervision and regulation on pages 1–8  

debit interchange  the firm believes that as a result of the “durbin amendment” provisions of the doddfrank act which limit the amount that the firm can charge for each debit card transaction the firm’s annualized net income has been reduced by approximately 600 million per year although the firm continues to consider various actions to mitigate this reduction in net income it is unlikely that any such actions will wholly offset such reduction 

volcker rule  until the final regulations under the volcker rule are adopted the precise definition of prohibited “proprietary trading” the scope of any exceptions including those related to marketmaking and hedging activities and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund investments remain uncertain it is unclear under the proposed rules whether some portion of the firm’s marketmakingrelated and risk mitigation activities as currently conducted will be required to be curtailed or will be otherwise adversely affected in addition the rules if enacted as proposed could prohibit the firm’s participation and investment in certain securitization structures and could bar the firm from sponsoring or investing in certain nonus funds also should regulators not exercise their authority to permit the firm to hold certain investments including those in illiquid private equity funds beyond the minimum statutory 



divestment period the firm could incur substantial losses when it disposes of such investments the firm may be forced to sell such investments at a substantial discount in the secondary market as a result of both the constrained timing of such sales and the possibility that other financial institutions are likewise liquidating investments at the same time 

derivatives  in addition to imposing comprehensive regulation on the firm’s derivatives businesses the doddfrank act also requires banking entities such as jpmorgan chase to significantly restructure their derivatives businesses including changing the legal entities through which such businesses are conducted further some of the rules for swaps will apply extraterritorially to us firms doing business with clients outside of the united states clients of nonus firms doing business outside the united states may not be required to comply with the same rules in similar transactions this disparity in the application of the different rules could place jpmorgan chase at a significant competitive disadvantage to its nonus competitors which could have a material adverse effect on the earnings and profitability of the firm’s wholesale businesses 

heightened prudential standards for systemically important financial institutions  under the doddfrank act jpmorgan chase is considered to be a systemically important financial institution and is subject to heightened prudential standards and supervision if the proposed rules issued by the federal reserve in december 2011 are adopted as currently proposed they are likely to increase the firm’s operational compliance and risk management costs and could have an adverse effect on the firm’s business results of operations or financial condition 

cfpb  the cfpb has issued final regulations regarding mortgages which will become effective in january 2014 and which will prohibit mortgage servicers from beginning foreclosure proceedings until a mortgage loan is 120 days delinquent and will impose an “ability to repay” requirement for residential mortgage loans other new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the cfpb may promulgate could require changes in jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses result in increased compliance costs and impair the profitability of such businesses in addition as a result of the doddfrank act’s potential expansion of the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation the firm could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions thereby further increasing its legal and compliance costs 

resolution  the fdic and the federal reserve have issued a final rule that requires the firm to submit periodically to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan under the bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure a “resolution plan” the fdic also issued a final rule that requires the firm to submit periodic contingency plans to the fdic under the federal deposit insurance act outlining its resolution plan in the event of its failure the firm’s initial resolution plan submissions were filed in july 

 

2012 and updates are due annually if the fdic and the federal reserve determine that the firm’s resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code the fdic and the federal reserve may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements on the firm or restrictions on the growth activities or operations of the firm or require the firm to restructure reorganize or divest certain assets or operations in order to facilitate an orderly resolution any such measures particularly those aimed at the disaggregation of the firm may reduce the firm’s capital adversely affect the firm’s operations and profitability increase the firm’s systems technology and managerial costs lessen efficiencies and economies of scale and potentially impede the firm’s business strategies 

in addition holders of subordinated debt or preferred stock issued by the firm may be fully subordinated to interests held by the us government in the event that the firm enters into a receivership insolvency liquidation or similar proceeding 

concentration limits  the doddfrank act restricts acquisitions by financial companies if as a result of the acquisition the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10 of the total liabilities of all financial companies in the united states the federal reserve is expected to issue rules related to these provisions in 2013 this concentration limit could restrict the firm’s ability to make acquisitions in the future thereby adversely affecting its growth prospects 

the total impact of the doddfrank act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how nonus policymakers and regulators respond to the doddfrank act and the implementing regulations under the act and how the cumulative effects of both us and nonus laws and regulations will affect the businesses and operations of the firm additional legislative or regulatory actions in the united states as well as in the other countries in which the firm operates could result in a significant loss of revenue for the firm limit the firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging affect the value of assets that the firm holds require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products impose additional costs on the firm or otherwise adversely affect the firm’s businesses accordingly any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on the firm’s business results of operations or financial condition 

nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the united states which could create increased compliance and other costs and adversely affect the firm’s business operations or profitability 

the eu has created a european systemic risk board to monitor financial stability and the group of twenty finance ministers and central bank governors “g20” broadened the membership and scope of the financial stability forum in 2008 to form the fsb these institutions which are 



part i 

charged with developing ways to promote crossborder financial stability are considering various proposals to address risks associated with global financial institutions some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries in the uk regulators have increased liquidity requirements for local financial institutions including regulated uk subsidiaries of nonuk bank holding companies and branches of nonuk banks located in the uk adopted a bank tax levy that applies to balance sheets of branches and subsidiaries of nonuk banks proposed that nonuk banks either obtain equal treatment for uk depositors or “subsidiarize” in the uk and proposed the creation of resolution and recovery plans by uk regulated entities among other initiatives 

in the eu there is an extensive and complex program of proposed regulatory enhancement which reflects in part the eu’s commitments to policies of the g20 together with other plans specific to the eu this program includes the european market infrastructure regulation “emir” which among other things would require central clearing of standardized derivatives and which is likely to be phased in starting in 2013 it also includes the revision of the existing markets in financial instruments directive “mifid ii” to deliver among other things the g20 commitment to onvenue trading of derivatives both emir and mifid ii include many other regulatory requirements that may have wideranging and material effects on the firm’s business operations 

the eu is also currently considering significant revisions to laws covering depositary activities credit rating activities resolution of banks investment firms and market infrastructures antimoneylaundering controls data security and privacy and corporate governance in financial firms together with implementation in the eu of the basel iii capital standards in addition the firm is monitoring any potential implications for its business of developments in relation to both bank structure in respect of which both the eu itself and a variety of eu member states unilaterally are considering new rules and the eu’s plans for a single supervisory mechanism for systemic banks under the european central bank for example the uk independent commission on banking the “vickers commission” proposed provisions which are now set forth in draft legislation that would mandate the separation or “ringfencing” of deposittaking activities from securities trading and other analogous activities within banks subject to certain exemptions the final legislation is expected to adopt and include the supplemental recommendation of the parliamentary commission on banking standards the “tyrie commission” that such ringfences should be “electrified” by the imposition of mandatory forced separation on banking institutions that are deemed to test the limits of the safeguards it is believed that the firm will have the benefit of the abovereferenced exemptions from the requirement to “ringfence” but this cannot be determined until the criteria are known with certainty 

 

parallel but distinct draft provisions have been published by the french and german governments which could affect the firm’s operations in those countries 

it is not possible to determine at the current time how these various proposals will affect the firm’s businesses or how each relate to the european commission’s forthcoming legislative proposals on bank structure arising out of the report of the high level expert group on reforming the structure of the eu banking sector the “liikanen group” however as regulatory requirements that are being proposed by these various regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations to which the firm is subject in the united states as well as in other parts of the world the firm may if these proposals are adopted be subjected to higher compliance and legal costs as well as the possibility of higher operational capital and liquidity costs all of which could have an adverse effect on the firm’s business results of operations and profitability in the future 

the basel iii capital standards will impose additional capital liquidity and other requirements on the firm that could decrease its competitiveness and profitability 

the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” announced in december 2010 revisions to its capital accord such revisions are commonly referred to as “basel iii” basel iii will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks narrow the definition of capital expand the definition of riskweighted assets and introduce shortterm liquidity and term funding standards among other things in june 2012 the us federal banking agencies published proposed capital rules to implement basel iii 

capital surcharge  in june 2011 the basel committee and the fsb proposed that gsibs be required to maintain additional capital above the basel iii tier 1 common equity minimum see page 5  in item 1 business for further information on the proposed capital change based on the firm’s current understanding of these new capital requirements the firm expects that it will be in compliance with all of the standards to which it will be subject as they become effective however compliance with these capital standards may reduce the firm’s return on equity or cause the firm to alter the types of products it offers to its customers and clients thereby causing the firm’s products to become less attractive or placing the firm at a competitive disadvantage to financial institutions both within and outside the united states that are not subject to the same capital surcharge 

liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios  the basel committee has also proposed two new measures of liquidity risk the “liquidity coverage ratio” and the “net stable funding ratio” which are intended to measure during an acute stress over different time spans the amount of the liquid assets held by the firm in relation to liquidity required if the ratios are finalized as currently proposed the firm may need to incur additional costs to raise liquidity and to take certain mitigating actions such as ceasing to 



offer certain products to its customers and clients or charging higher fees for extending certain lines of credit in order to be in compliance with such ratios accordingly compliance with these liquidity coverage standards could adversely affect the firm’s funding costs or reduce its profitability in the future 

elimination of use of external credit ratings  the federal reserve the occ and the fdic have issued final rules for riskbased capital guidelines which eliminate the use of external credit ratings for the calculation of riskweighted assets this will result in a significant increase in the calculation of the firm’s riskweighted assets which will require the firm to hold more capital increase its cost of doing business and place the firm at a competitive disadvantage to nonus competitors 

expanded regulatory oversight of jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses will increase the firm’s compliance costs and risks and may negatively affect the profitability of such businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to its compliance with consumer laws and regulations including changes implemented as part of the doddfrank act the firm has entered into consent orders with its banking regulators relating to its bank secrecy act “bsa” and antimoney laundering “aml” policies procedures and controls and with respect to its residential mortgage servicing foreclosure and lossmitigation activities the firm also agreed in 2012 to a global settlement with a number of federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages the mortgagerelated consent order and global settlement require the firm to make cash payments and provide certain refinancing and other borrower relief as well as to adhere to certain enhanced mortgage servicing standards and the bsaaml consent order will require the firm to make enhancements to its procedures make investments in its technology and hire additional personnel all of which will increase the firm’s operational and compliance costs 

new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the cfpb may promulgate could require changes in the product offerings and practices of jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses and affect the profitability of such businesses 

finally as a result of increasing federal and state scrutiny of the firm’s consumer practices the firm may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions and litigation thereby increasing its costs associated with responding to or defending such actions in addition increased regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting the firm’s consumer businesses and any required changes to the firm’s business operations resulting from these developments could result in significant loss of revenue limit the products or services the firm offers require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products impose 

 

additional compliance costs on the firm cause harm to the firm’s reputation or otherwise adversely affect the firm’s consumer businesses if the firm does not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to its consumer operations the firm may be subject to fines penalties or judgments or material regulatory restrictions on its businesses which could adversely affect the firm’s operations and in turn its financial results 

implementation of the firm’s resolution plan under the us resolution plan rules could materially impair the claims of jpmorgan chase debt holders 

as noted above in july 2012 jpmorgan chase submitted to the federal reserve and the fdic its initial plan for resolution of the firm the firm’s resolution plan includes strategies to resolve the firm under the bankruptcy code and also recommends to the fdic and the federal reserve the firm’s proposed optimal strategy to resolve the firm under the special resolution procedure provided in title ii of the doddfrank act “title ii” 

the firm’s recommendation for its optimal title ii strategy would involve a “single point of entry” recapitalization model in which the fdic would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for jpmorgan chase transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the firm’s business principally the stock of jpmorgan chase  co’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries to the bridge entity recapitalize those businesses by contributing some or all of such intercompany claims to the capital of such subsidiaries and by exchanging debt claims against jpmorgan chase  co for equity in the bridge entity if the firm were to be resolved under this strategy no assurance can be given that the value of the stock of the bridge entity distributed to the holders of debt obligations of jpmorgan chase  co would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or part of the principal amount of and interest on the debt obligations for which such stock was exchanged 

market risk 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by us and international financial market and economic conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions including the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates and currency and commodities prices investor sentiment events that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit the occurrence of natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and the health of us or international economies 

in the firm’s wholesale businesses the abovementioned factors can affect transactions involving the firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses the realization of cash returns from its private equity business the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its customers and 



part i 

therefore the revenue that the firm receives from commissions and spreads and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the firm 

the firm generally maintains extensive positions in the fixed income currency commodities and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients the firm may have marketmaking positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity the revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors including the firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets all of which are affected by economic and market conditions the firm anticipates that revenue relating to its marketmaking and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such activities and that this could materially adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the fees that the firm earns for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets that the firm manages or holds in custody which in turn could affect the firm’s revenue macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the firm’s funds or accounts 

changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the firm earns from net interest income a low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of the firm’s businesses by compressing net interest margins reducing the amounts that the firm earns on its investment securities portfolio or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights “msr” asset thereby reducing the firm’s net interest income and other revenues 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions including us interest rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies if the current positive trends in the us economy are not sustained this could diminish demand for the products and services of the firm’s consumer businesses or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment could lead to an increase in mortgage credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce the firm’s earnings 

widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to firmspecific events and circumstances but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions 

 

changes in the firm’s credit spreads will impact positively or negatively the firm’s earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value 

despite improved financial market conditions many of the structural issues facing the eurozone remain and problems could resurface which could have significant adverse effects on jpmorgan chase’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

notwithstanding improved financial market conditions many of the structural issues facing the eurozone remain and problems could resurface which could have significant adverse effects on jpmorgan chase’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity particularly if they lead to sovereign debt default significant bank failures or defaults andor the exit of one or more countries from the european monetary union the “emu” 

the ecb’s outright monetary transaction program continues to underpin an improved risk environment shifting the focus of the crisis from immediate financing strains to the more structural challenges of fiscal retrenchment and stimulation of gdp growth however financial market conditions could materially worsen if for example consecutive eurozone countries were to default on their sovereign debt significant bank failures or defaults in these countries were to occur andor one or more of the members of the eurozone were to exit the emu yields on government bonds of certain eurozone countries including greece ireland italy portugal and spain have remained volatile despite various stabilization packages and facilities that have been implemented to assist various distressed eurozone countries concerns have been and continue to be raised as to the financial effectiveness of the assistance measures taken to date and such concerns could intensify concerns could also be triggered by political developments with key elections in italy and germany during 2013 and ongoing uncertainty about the tolerance of austerity across the eurozone 

continued economic turmoil in the eurozone could lead to a further deterioration of global economic conditions and thereby adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations in europe and elsewhere there can be no assurance that the various steps that jpmorgan chase has taken to protect its businesses results of operations and financial condition against the results of the eurozone crisis will be sufficient 

further the effects of the eurozone debt crisis could be even more significant if they lead to a partial or complete breakup of the emu the partial or full breakup of the emu would be unprecedented and its impact highly uncertain the exit of one or more countries from the emu or the dissolution of the emu could lead to redenomination of certain obligations of obligors in exiting countries any such exit and redenomination would cause significant uncertainty with respect to outstanding obligations of counterparties and debtors in any exiting country whether sovereign or otherwise and lead to complex and lengthy disputes and litigation the resulting uncertainty and 



market stress could also cause among other things severe disruption to equity markets significant increases in bond yields generally potential failure or default of financial institutions including those of systemic importance a significant decrease in global liquidity a freezeup of global credit markets and a potential worldwide recession any combination of such events could negatively impact jpmorgan chase’s businesses financial condition and results of operations in addition one or more emu exits and currency redenominations could be accompanied by imposition of capital exchange and similar controls which could further negatively impact jpmorgan chase’s crossborder risk and other aspects of its businesses and its earnings see “management’s discussion and analysis  country risk management” on pages 170–173  for a discussion of the firm’s european exposures 

changes are being considered in the method for determining libor and it is not apparent how any such changes could affect the value of liborlinked obligations of jpmorgan chase or how such changes could affect the firm’s financial condition or results of operations 

beginning in 2008 concerns have been raised about the accuracy of the calculation of the daily london interbank offered rate “libor” which is currently overseen by the british bankers’ association the “bba” the bba has taken steps to change the process for determining libor by increasing the number of banks surveyed to set libor and to strengthen the oversight of the process the final report of the wheatley review of libor published in september 2012 set forth recommendations relating to the setting and administration of libor including the gradual phasing out of certain currencies and maturities in december 2012 the uk government adopted legislation enacting one of those recommendations making it a criminal offense to attempt to manipulate the setting of benchmark rates the uk government also announced that the uk financial services authority “fsa” intends to incorporate the rest of the wheatley review recommendations in new regulations relating to the libor process 

at the present time it is uncertain the extent of changes if any may be required or made by the fsa or other governmental or regulatory authorities in the method for determining libor accordingly at the present time it is not apparent whether or to what extent any such changes would have an adverse impact on the value of any liborlinked debt securities issued by the firm or any loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit for which the firm is an obligor or whether or to what extent any such changes would have an adverse effect on the value of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to the firm or on the firm’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

credit risk 

the financial condition of jpmorgan chase’s customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect the firm 

if the current positive economic trends globally are not sustained more of jpmorgan chase’s customers may become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the firm which in turn could result in a higher level of chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses or in requirements that the firm purchase assets from or provide other funding to its clients and counterparties any of which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition moreover a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the firm’s counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating the firm’s credit risk exposure and increasing the losses including marktomarket losses that the firm could incur in its marketmaking and clearing businesses 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of marketmaking trading clearing counterparty or other relationships the firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose the firm to credit risk and in some cases disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity the firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to the firm further disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity periods of illiquidity could produce losses if the firm is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral 

concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses 

jpmorgan chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions as a result the firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks the firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful 

in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the firm’s inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of its positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce the firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase 



part i 

the level of riskweighted assets on the firm’s balance sheet thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the firm’s businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s role as a clearing and custody bank in the us triparty repurchase business exposes it to credit risks including intraday credit risk 

the firm is a market leader in providing clearing custodial and prime brokerage services for financial services companies in addition the firm acts as a clearing and custody bank in the us triparty repurchase transaction market many of these transactions expose the firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client and in the case of its role in the us triparty repurchase business can expose the firm to intraday credit risk of the cash borrowers usually brokerdealers however this exposure is secured by collateral and typically extinguished through the settlement process by the end of the day the firm actively participated in the triparty repo infrastructure reform task force sponsored by the federal reserve bank of new york which issued recommendations to modify and improve the infrastructure of triparty repurchase transactions in order to among other things mitigate intraday credit exposure the firm has implemented many of the recommendations and intends to implement the intraday credit recommendations by the end of 2013 as a result the firm expects its intraday credit exposure after implementation of all the task force recommendations to be substantially reduced nevertheless if a brokerdealer that is party to a repurchase transaction cleared by the firm becomes bankrupt or insolvent the firm may become involved in disputes and litigation with the brokerdealer’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations all of which can increase the firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if the securities in the repurchase transaction decline in value 

liquidity risk 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses some potential conditions that could impair the firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption unforeseen cash or capital requirements including among others commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in the firm or financial markets in general these conditions may be caused by events over which the firm has little or no control the widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages credit card 

 

receivables and other assets and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future 

if the firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding such as bank deposits are reduced the firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability 

as a holding company jpmorgan chase  co relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and consequently its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends loans or other payments several of jpmorgan chase  co’s principal subsidiaries are subject to dividend distribution or capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments limitations in the payments that jpmorgan chase  co receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position 

some regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in countries in which they operate and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries if adopted these requirements could hinder the firm’s ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner 

reductions in the firm’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the firm 

jpmorgan chase  co and certain of its subsidiaries including jpmorgan chase bank na are currently rated by credit rating agencies in 2012 moody’s and fitch downgraded the ratings of jpmorgan chase  co in addition as of yearend 2012 moody’s had jpmorgan chase  co and sp had jpmorgan chase  co jpmorgan chase bank na and certain other subsidiaries on “negative” outlook indicating the possibility of a further downgrade in ratings although the firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future for example the rating agencies have indicated that further control failures by the firm such as was evidenced in the chief investment office “cio” matter discussed below deterioration in capital liquidity and asset quality levels or a significant increase in risk appetite could put downward pressure on the firm’s ratings additionally the rating agencies have indicated that they intend to reevaluate the credit ratings of systemically important financial institutions in light of the provisions of the doddfrank act that seek to eliminate any implicit government support for such institutions 

furthermore the rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends including sovereign creditworthiness elevated economic uncertainty and higher funding spreads all of which could lead to downgrades in the credit ratings of global banks including the firm there is no assurance that any such downgrades from rating agencies if they affected the firm’s credit ratings would not occur at times of broader market instability when the 



firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

further a reduction in the firm’s credit ratings could reduce the firm’s access to debt markets materially increase the cost of issuing debt trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted contractually or otherwise to do business with or lend to the firm thereby curtailing the firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability in addition any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase  co and its subsidiaries and as a result could adversely affect the value of debt obligations that they have issued or may issue in the future 

legal risk 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties there is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future actions currently pending against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm which could materially adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm to the firm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that the firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations 

the firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions in 2012 the firm was the subject of consent orders from its banking regulators and entered into a global settlement with federal and state governmental agencies relating to its mortgage servicing and origination activities in january 2013 the firm also entered into consent orders with its banking regulators related to risk management model governance and other control functions related to cio and certain other trading activities at the firm and with respect to the firm’s and certain of its bank subsidiaries’ policies procedures and controls relating to compliance with bsa and aml requirements as the regulators continue to examine the operations of the firm and its bank subsidiaries there is no assurance that additional consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future these and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject the firm to further judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause the firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities all of which could lead to reputational issues or higher operational costs thereby reducing the firm’s revenue 

 

business and operational risks 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic monetary and political developments in the united states and around the world 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various us and nonus regulatory authorities and agencies the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the united states and the return earned on those loans and investments changes in federal reserve policies as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of nonus central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies are beyond the firm’s control and consequently the impact of changes in these policies on the firm’s activities and results of operations is difficult to predict 

the firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and marketmaking in securities of companies worldwide these risks include among others risk of loss from unfavorable political legal or other developments including social or political instability in the countries in which such companies operate as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below 

several of the firm’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of us and nonus governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities these activities can expose the firm to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputational risks including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations 

further various countries in which the firm operates or invests or in which the firm may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions as noted above concerns regarding the fiscal condition of certain countries within the eurozone continue and there is no assurance such concerns will not lead to “market contagion” beyond those countries in the eurozone or beyond the eurozone accordingly it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries even in countries in which the firm does not conduct business or have operations will adversely affect the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s international growth strategy may be hindered by local political social and economic factors and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks 

jpmorgan chase has expanded and plans to continue to grow its international wholesale businesses in europemiddle eastafrica “emea” asiapacific and latin americacaribbean as part of its international growth strategy the firm seeks to provide a wider range of 



part i 

financial services to its clients that conduct business in those regions and to expand its international operations 

many of the countries in which jpmorgan chase intends to grow its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than the united states and other developed markets in which the firm currently operates some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation or low or negative growth among other negative conditions or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment in addition these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in and may in the future lead to social unrest general strikes and demonstrations outbreaks of hostilities overthrow of incumbent governments terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord all of which can adversely affect the firm’s operations or investments in such countries political social or economic disruption or dislocation in countries or regions in which the firm seeks to expand its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations and there can be no assurance that the firm will be able to successfully execute its international growth initiatives 

less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the firm’s operations in those countries including among others the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions 

revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations as well as due to governmental actions including expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can and has in the past affected the firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries including the firm’s operations in the united states as a result any such unfavorable conditions 

 

or developments could have an adverse impact on the firm’s business and results of operations 

conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that the firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems in addition the firm can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring its operations outside the united states to comply with us anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchase and indemnity obligations 

in connection with the sale and securitization of loans whether with or without recourse the originator is generally required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized jpmorgan chase and some of its subsidiaries have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans and the firm will continue to do so when it securitizes loans it has originated if a loan that does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized the firm may be obligated to repurchase the loan and incur any associated loss directly or the firm may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses since 2010 the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to us governmentsponsored entities “gses” such as fannie mae and freddie mac have been elevated and there is no assurance that such costs will not continue to be elevated in the future accordingly repurchase or indemnity obligations to the gses or to private thirdparty purchasers could materially and adversely affect the firm’s results of operations and earnings in the future 

the repurchase liability that the firm records with respect to its loan repurchase obligations to the gses is estimated based on several factors including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by purchasers the firm’s ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchases demands the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure the firm’s potential ability to recover certain losses from thirdparty originators and the terms of agreements with certain mortgage insurers and other parties while the firm believes that its current repurchase liability reserves are adequate the factors referred to above are subject to change based on the gses’ future behavior the economic environment and other uncertainties accordingly there is no assurance that such reserves will not be increased in the future 

the firm also faces litigation related to securitizations primarily related to securitizations not sold to the gses the 



firm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves while the firm believes that its current reserves in respect of such litigation matters are adequate there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

jpmorgan chase may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that it satisfies requirements relating to mortgage servicing and foreclosures 

the firm has as described above entered into the consent orders with its banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing foreclosure and lossmitigation activities and agreed to the global settlement with federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages the firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its efforts to enhance its mortgage origination servicing and foreclosure procedures including the enhancements required under the consent orders and the global settlement in addition the gses impose compensatory fees on their mortgage servicers including the firm if such servicers are unable to comply with the foreclosure timetables mandated by the gses and such fees may continue to be imposed on the firm in the future 

jpmorgan chase’s commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the firm to significant cost and liability 

jpmorgan chase engages in the storage transportation marketing or trading of several commodities including metals agricultural products crude oil oil products natural gas electric power emission credits coal freight and related products and indices the firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing developing and trading emission reduction credits as a result of all of these activities the firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy commodities environmental and other governmental laws and regulations the firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity and to restrict some of the firm’s activities which could result in lower revenues from the firm’s commodities activities in addition the firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties furthermore liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations 

the firm’s commodities activities also further expose the firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events including natural disasters leaks spills explosions release of toxic substances fires accidents on land and at sea wars and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries loss of life property damage damage to the firm’s reputation and suspension of operations the firm’s commodities activities are also subject to disruptions many 

 

of which are outside of the firm’s control from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment transmission lines or other equipment or processes and the contractual failure of performance by thirdparty suppliers or service providers including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities the firm’s actions to mitigate its risks related to the abovementioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency in addition insurance covering some of these risks may not be available and the proceeds if any from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents as a result the firm’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events 

jpmorgan chase relies on its systems employees and certain counterparties and certain failures could materially adversely affect the firm’s operations 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are dependent on the firm’s ability to process record and monitor a large number of complex transactions if the firm’s financial accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially adversely affected the firm is similarly dependent on its employees the firm could be materially adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firm’s operations or systems third parties with which the firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the firm including with respect to breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties in addition as the firm changes processes or introduces new products and services the firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes any of these occurrences could diminish the firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients increased operating expenses higher litigation costs including fines and sanctions reputational damage regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing any of which could materially adversely affect the firm 

if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the firm’s possession were to be mishandled or misused the firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where for example such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either through the fault of the firm’s systems employees or counterparties or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 

the firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the firm’s control which may include for example security breaches as discussed further below electrical or 



part i 

telecommunications outages failures of computer servers or other damage to the firm’s property or assets natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics or events arising from local or larger scale political events including terrorist acts jpmorgan chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption while the firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the firm any failures or disruptions of the firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the firm to losses or liability or require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption as well as by exposing the firm to litigation regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance 

a breach in the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems could disrupt its businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the firm 

although jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the firm’s computer systems software networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to the firm and its customers there is no assurance that all of the firm’s security measures will provide absolute security jpmorgan chase and other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means the firm and several other us financial institutions have also experienced several significant distributed denialofservice attacks from technically sophisticated and wellresourced third parties which were intended to disrupt consumer online banking services 

despite the firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems it is possible that the firm may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties outside the firm such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those parties may also 

 

attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of the firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the firm’s data or that of its customers or clients these risks may increase in the future as the firm continues to increase its mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expands its internal usage of webbased products and applications 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the firm’s systems could cause serious negative consequences for the firm including significant disruption of the firm’s operations misappropriation of confidential information of the firm or that of its customers or damage to computers or systems of the firm and those of its customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to the firm or to its customers loss of confidence in the firm’s security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure and harm to the firm’s reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated 

jpmorgan chase has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business by acquiring other businesses there can be no assurance that the firm’s acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results including results relating to the total cost of integration the time required to complete the integration the amount of longerterm cost savings the overall performance of the combined entity or an improved price for jpmorgan chase  co’s common stock integration efforts could divert management attention and resources which could adversely affect the firm’s operations or results the firm cannot provide assurance that any such integration efforts would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses 

acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause the firm to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to competing financial institutions it is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of the firm’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect the firm’s ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and other business partners the loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect the firm’s ability to successfully conduct its business 

risk management 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the firm the firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which the firm is subject including liquidity risk credit risk market 



risk interest rate risk country risk principal risk operational risk legal and fiduciary risk and reputational risk among others however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to the firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist or develop in the future risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified if the firm’s risk management framework proves ineffective the firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected as the firm’s businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve the firm’s risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes as a result there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified monitored or managed in addition in a difficult or less liquid market environment the firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for the firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants 

the firm’s products including loans leases lending commitments derivatives trading account assets and assets heldforsale as well as cash management and clearing activities expose the firm to credit risk as one of the nation’s largest lenders the firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties and the credit quality of the firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings the firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposure including unfunded lending commitments the firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the firm in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to the firm’s financial results and condition and require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations as is the case with any such assessments there is always the chance that the firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

jpmorgan chase’s marketmaking businesses may expose the firm to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause the firm to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative certain of the firm’s derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities commodities or obligations that the firm does not own if the firm is unable to obtain such securities commodities or obligations 

 

within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays which could damage the firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business in addition in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis the firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default the firm may be exposed to market and operational losses in particular disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise which could force the firm to incur unexpected costs including transaction legal and litigation costs and impair the firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products 

many of the firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by the firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the firm’s risk management strategies causing the firm to incur losses the firm cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework including the firm’s underlying assumptions or strategies will at all times be accurate and effective 

in connection with the firm’s internal review of the reported losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by cio management concluded that during the first quarter of 2012 cio’s risk management had been ineffective in dealing with the growth in the size and complexity of the portfolio during the first quarter of 2012 among other matters the firm’s internal review found that cio lacked a robust risk committee structure that cio’s risk limits were insufficiently granular and should have been reassessed in light of the positions being added to the synthetic credit portfolio in the first quarter of 2012 that cio risk management was insufficiently engaged in the approval and implementation during the first quarter of 2012 of a new cio valueatrisk “var” model related to the portfolio before that model was discontinued and the previous model was restored and that there was inadequate escalation to the firm’s management of certain risk issues relating to the portfolio the firm has taken steps to correct such lapses including among other things appointing a new chief risk officer for ciotreasurycorporate “ctc” adding resources and talent in cio risk management instituting new ctc risk committees to improve governance and controls and ensure tighter linkages between cio treasury and other activities in the corporate sector and introducing more granular risk limits for cio 



part i 

in january 2013 jpmorgan chase  co entered into a consent order with the federal reserve and jpmorgan chase bank na entered into a consent order with the occ relating to the banking regulators’ reviews of the cio matter these consent orders relate to risk management model governance and other control functions related to cio and certain other trading activities at the firm many of the actions required by the consent orders have already been or are in the process of being implemented by the firm 

while the firm has taken and is taking steps to correct the lapses in the cio risk management framework there is no assurance that new or additional lapses in the firm’s risk management framework and governance structure could not occur in the future any such lapses or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the firm’s risk management framework governance procedures or practices could individually or in the aggregate cause unexpected losses for the firm materially and adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency attract heightened regulatory scrutiny expose the firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings subject the firm to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the firm’s operations profitability or reputation 

the firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures nevertheless in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures or in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time on july 13 2012 the firm reported that it had determined that a material weakness existed in its internal control over financial reporting at march 31 2012 this determination related to the valuation control function for the synthetic credit portfolio managed by cio during the first quarter of 2012 as a result of the material weakness management also concluded that the firm’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at march 31 2012 management has taken steps to remediate the internal control deficiency including enhancing management supervision of valuation matters the control deficiency was substantially remediated by june 30 2012 and was closedout by september 30 2012 

there can be no assurance that the firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could not occur again any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition restrict its ability to access the capital markets require the firm to expend significant resources to 

 

correct the lapses or deficiencies expose the firm to regulatory or legal proceedings subject it to fines penalties or judgments harm the firm’s reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

other risks 

the financial services industry is highly competitive and jpmorgan chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as the financial services industry produces bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices 

competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks hedge funds commodity trading companies private equity firms insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading the firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the firm’s products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share increased competition also may require the firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive these investments may increase expense or may require the firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions the firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations 

competitors of the firm’s nonus wholesale businesses are typically subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes for example the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the doddfrank act including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the volcker rule and the derivatives “pushout” rules have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the united states and may not be implemented into law in most countries the more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to us financial services institutions such as jpmorgan chase can put the firm at a competitive disadvantage to its nonus competitors including 



prohibiting the firm from engaging in certain transactions making the firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the firm’s cost structure for providing certain products all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the firm’s wholesale businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the firm’s performance 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are the firm’s most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense the imposition on the firm or its employees of restrictions on executive compensation may adversely affect the firm’s ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees if the firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees the firm’s performance including its competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if incorrect could cause unexpected losses in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states jpmorgan chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements including in determining allowances for credit losses mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigation among other items certain of the firm’s financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities availableforsale securities certain loans msrs private equity investments structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the firm’s financial statements where quoted market prices are not available the firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment if assumptions or estimates underlying the firm’s financial statements are incorrect the firm may experience material losses 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could damage its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to the firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers investors and employees damage to the firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the firm’s business and prospects harm to the firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct compliance failures litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations in addition a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality or a failure or 

 

perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly can result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and harm to the firm’s reputation adverse publicity regarding the firm whether or not true may result in harm to the firm’s prospects actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the firm’s reputation for example the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the firm’s reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the firm’s earnings and results of operations 

management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among the firm’s clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the firm or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions as well as cause serious reputational harm to the firm

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chase ’s financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm 

regulatory risk 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and the firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject 

as a global financial services firm jpmorgan chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under state and federal laws in the united states and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the united states in which the firm does business these laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the firm does business and can restrict the scope of its existing businesses and limit its ability to expand its product offerings or to pursue acquisitions or can make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers 

the full impact of the doddfrank act on the firm’s businesses operations and earnings remains uncertain because of the extensive rulemaking still to be completed 

the doddfrank act   enacted in 2010 significantly increases the regulation of the financial services industry for further information see supervision and regulation on pages 1–7 

the us department of the treasury the fsoc the sec the cftc the federal reserve the occ the cfpb and the fdic are engaged in extensive rulemaking mandated by the doddfrank act and much of the rulemaking remains to be done as a result the complete impact of the doddfrank act on the firm remains uncertain certain aspects of the doddfrank act and such rulemaking are discussed in more detail below 

debit interchange  the firm believes that as a result of the durbin amendment its annualized net income may be reduced by approximately 600 million per year although the firm continues to consider various actions that it may 

 

take to mitigate this anticipated reduction in net income it is unlikely that any such actions would wholly offset such reduction 

volcker rule until the final regulations under the volcker rule are adopted the precise definition of prohibited “proprietary trading” the scope of any exceptions for market making and hedging and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund activities remains uncertain it is unclear under the proposed rules whether some portion of the firm’s marketmaking and risk mitigation activities as currently conducted will be required to be curtailed or will be otherwise adversely affected in addition the rules if enacted as proposed would prohibit certain securitization structures and would bar us banking entities from sponsoring or investing in certain nonus funds also with respect to certain of the firm’s investments in illiquid private equity funds should regulators not exercise their authority to permit the firm to hold such investments beyond the minimum statutory divestment period the firm could incur substantial losses when it disposes of such investments as it may be forced to sell such investments at a substantial discount in the secondary market as a result of both the constrained timing of such sales and the possibility that other financial institutions are likewise liquidating their investments at the same time 

derivatives in addition to imposing comprehensive regulation on the firm’s derivatives businesses the doddfrank act also requires banking entities such as jpmorgan chase to significantly restructure their derivatives businesses including changing the legal entities through which such businesses are conducted further the proposed margin rules for uncleared swaps may apply extraterritorially to us firms doing business with clients outside of the united states clients of nonus firms doing business outside the united states would not be required to post margin in similar transactions if these margin rules become final as currently drafted jpmorgan chase could be at a significant competitive disadvantage to its nonus competitors which could have a material adverse effect on the earnings and profitability of the firm’s wholesale businesses 

heightened prudential standards for systemically important financial institutions  under the doddfrank act jpmorgan chase is considered a systemically important financial institution and is subject to the heightened standards and supervision prescribed by the act if the proposed rules that were issued on december 20 2011 are adopted as currently proposed they are likely to increase the firm’s operational compliance and risk management costs and could have an adverse effect on the firm’s business results of operations or financial condition 

cfpb although the firm is unable to predict what specific measures the cfpb may take in applying its regulatory mandate any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the cfpb may promulgate could require changes in jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses 



part i 

and result in increased compliance costs and impair the profitability of such businesses in addition as a result of the doddfrank act’s potential expansion of the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation the firm could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions thereby further increasing its legal and compliance costs 

resolution and recovery the fdic and the federal reserve have issued a final rule that will require the firm to submit periodically to the federal reserve the fdic and the fsoc a resolution plan under the bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure a “resolution plan” in 2012 the fdic also issued a final rule that will require the firm to submit periodic contingency plans to the fdic under the federal deposit insurance act outlining its resolution plan in the event of its failure the firm’s initial resolution plan submissions are due on july 1 2012 with annual updates thereafter and the firm is in the process of developing its resolution plans if the fdic and the federal reserve determine that the firm’s resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code the fdic and the federal reserve may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on the growth activities or operations of the firm or require the firm to restructure reorganize or divest certain assets or operations in order to facilitate an orderly resolution any such measures particularly those aimed at the disaggregation of the firm may increase the firm’s systems technology and managerial costs reduce the firm’s capital lessen efficiencies and economies of scale and potentially impede the firm’s business strategies 

elimination of use of external credit ratings in december 2011 the federal reserve the occ and the fdic issued proposed rules for riskbased capital guidelines which would eliminate the use of external credit ratings for the calculation of riskweighted assets if the rules become final as currently proposed they would result in a significant increase in the calculation of the firm’s riskweighted assets which could require the firm to hold more capital increase its cost of doing business and place the firm at a competitive disadvantage to nonus competitors 

concentration limits the doddfrank act restricts acquisitions by financial companies if as a result of the acquisition the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10 of the total liabilities of all financial companies the federal reserve is expected to issue rules related to these provisions of the doddfrank act in 2012 this concentration limit could restrict the firm’s ability to make acquisitions in the future thereby adversely affecting its growth prospects 

the total impact of the doddfrank act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how nonus policymakers and regulators will respond to the doddfrank act and the implementing regulations under the act and how the cumulative effects of both us and nonus laws 

 

and regulations will affect the businesses and operations of the firm additional legislative or regulatory actions in the united states the eu or in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue for the firm limit the firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging affect the value of assets that the firm holds require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products impose additional costs on the firm or otherwise adversely affect the firm’s businesses accordingly any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on the firm’s business results of operations or financial condition 

the basel iii capital standards will impose additional capital liquidity and other requirements on the firm that could decrease its competitiveness and profitability 

the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” announced in december 2010 revisions to its capital accord commonly referred to as “basel iii” which will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks narrow the definition of capital expand the definition of riskweighted assets and introduce shortterm liquidity and term funding standards among other things 

capital surcharge in june 2011 the basel committee and the fsb proposed that gsibs be required to maintain additional capital above the basel iii tier 1 common equity minimum see page 2 in item 1 business for further information on the proposed capital change based on the firm’s current understanding of these new capital requirements the firm expects that it will be in compliance with all of the standards to which it will be subject as they become effective however compliance with these capital standards may adversely affect the firm’s operational costs reduce its return on equity or cause the firm to alter the types of products it offers to its customers and clients thereby causing the firm’s products to become less attractive or placing the firm at a competitive disadvantage to financial institutions both within and outside the united states that are not subject to the same capital surcharge 

liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios the basel committee has also proposed two new measures of liquidity risk the “liquidity coverage ratio” and the “net stable funding ratio” which are intended to measure over different time spans the amount of the liquid assets held by the firm if the ratios are finalized as currently proposed the firm may need in order to be in compliance with such ratios to incur additional costs to raise liquidity from sources that are more expensive than its current funding sources and may need to take certain mitigating actions such as ceasing to offer certain products to its customers and clients or charging higher fees for extending certain lines of credit accordingly compliance with these liquidity coverage standards could adversely affect the firm’s funding costs or reduce its profitability in the future 



nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the united states which could create increased compliance and other costs and adversely affect the firm’s businesses operations or financial conditions 

the eu has created a european systemic risk board to monitor financial stability and the group of twenty finance ministers and central bank governors “g20” broadened the membership and scope of the financial stability forum in 2008 to form the fsb these institutions which are charged with developing ways to promote crossborder financial stability are considering various proposals to address risks associated with global financial institutions some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries in the uk regulators have increased liquidity requirements for local financial institutions including regulated uk subsidiaries of nonuk bank holding companies and branches of nonuk banks located in the uk adopted a bank tax levy that applies to balance sheets of branches and subsidiaries of nonuk banks and proposed the creation of resolution and recovery plans by uk regulated entities among other initiatives 

the regulatory schemes and requirements that are being proposed by various regulators around the world may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations to which the firm is subject in the united states as well as in other parts of the world thereby subjecting the firm to higher compliance and legal costs as well as the possibility of higher operational capital and liquidity costs all of which could have an adverse effect on the firm’s business results of operations and profitability in the future 

expanded regulatory oversight of jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses will increase the firm’s compliance costs and risks and may negatively affect the profitability of such businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to its compliance under consumer laws and regulations including changes implemented as a part of the doddfrank act the firm has entered into consent orders with banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing foreclosure and lossmitigation activities the consent orders require significant changes to the firm’s servicing and default business the submission and implementation of a comprehensive action plan setting forth the steps necessary to ensure the firm’s residential mortgage servicing foreclosure and lossmitigation activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements of the consent orders and other remedial actions that the firm has undertaken to ensure that it satisfies all requirements of the consent orders the firm also agreed in february 2012 to a settlement in principle with a number of federal and state government agencies including the us department of justice the us department of housing and urban development the cfpb and the state attorneys general relating to the servicing and origination of 

 

mortgages this global settlement requires the firm to make cash payments and provide certain refinancing and other borrower relief as well as to adhere to certain enhanced mortgage servicing standards for further information see “subsequent events” in note 2 on page 184 and mortgage foreclosure investigations and litigation in note 31 on pages 295–296 

in addition any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the cfpb may promulgate could require changes in the product offerings and practices of jpmorgan chase’s consumer businesses result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses 

finally as a result of increasing federal and state scrutiny of 

the firm’s consumer practices the firm may face a greater 

number or wider scope of investigations enforcement actions 

and litigation in the future thereby increasing its costs 

associated with responding to or defending such actions in 

addition increased regulatory inquiries and investigations as 

well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments 

affecting the firm’s consumer businesses and any required 

changes to the firm’s business operations resulting from 

these developments could result in significant loss of 

revenue limit the products or services the firm offers require 

the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand 

for its products impose additional compliance costs on the 

firm cause harm to the firm’s reputation or otherwise 

adversely affect the firm’s consumer businesses in addition 

if the firm does not appropriately comply with current or 

future legislation and regulations that apply to its consumer 

operations the firm may be subject to fines penalties or 

judgments or material regulatory restrictions on its 

businesses which could adversely affect the firm’s operations 

and in turn its financial results 

market risk 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by us and international financial market and economic conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions including the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates and currency and commodities prices investor sentiment events that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit the occurrence of natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and the health of us or international economies 

in the firm’s wholesale businesses the abovementioned factors can affect transactions involving the firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses the realization of cash returns from its private equity business the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its customers and therefore the revenue that the firm receives from commissions and spreads and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the firm 



part i 

the firm generally maintains extensive positions in the fixed income currency commodities and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients from time to time the firm may have marketmaking positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity the revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors including the firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets all of which are affected by economic and market conditions the firm anticipates that revenue relating to its marketmaking and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such activities and that this could materially adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the fees that the firm earns for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets that the firm manages or holds in custody which in turn could affect the firm’s revenue macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the firm’s funds or accounts 

changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the firm’s balance sheet and the revenue the firm earns from net interest income a low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of the firm’s businesses by compressing net interest margins reducing the amounts the firm earns on its investment securities portfolio or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights “msr” asset thereby reducing the firm’s net interest income and other revenues 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions including us interest rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies any further deterioration in current economic conditions or the failure of the economy to rebound in the near term could diminish demand for the products and services of the firm’s consumer businesses or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as continuing declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment could lead to an increase in mortgage credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce the firm’s earnings 

widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to firmspecific events and circumstances but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in the firm’s credit spreads will impact positively or negatively the firm’s earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value 

 

the outcome of the eu sovereign debt crisis could have adverse effects on the firm’s businesses operations and earnings 

despite various assistance packages and facilities for greece ireland and portugal it is not possible to predict how markets will react if one or more of these countries were to default and such a default if it were to occur could lead to “market contagion” in other eurozone countries and thereby adversely affect the market value of securities and other obligations held by the firm’s ib am tss and cio businesses in addition the departure of any eurozone country from the euro could lead to serious foreign exchange operational and settlement disruptions which in turn may have a negative impact on the firm’s operations and businesses 

credit risk 

the financial condition of jpmorgan chase’s customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect the firm 

if the current economic environment were to deteriorate further or not rebound in the near term more of jpmorgan chase’s customers may become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the firm which in turn could result in a higher level of chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses or in requirements that the firm purchase assets from or provide other funding to its clients and counterparties any of which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition moreover a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the firm’s counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating the firm’s credit risk exposure and increasing the losses including marktomarket losses that the firm could incur in its marketmaking and clearing businesses 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of marketmaking trading clearing counterparty or other relationships the firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose the firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client the firm is a market leader in providing clearing custodial and prime brokerage services for financial services companies when such a client of the firm becomes bankrupt or insolvent the firm may become entangled in significant disputes and litigation with the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations all of which can increase the firm’s operational and litigation costs 

during periods of market stress or illiquidity the firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to the firm further disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly 



increase in times of market stress and illiquidity periods of illiquidity as experienced in 2008 and early 2009 may occur again and could produce losses if the firm is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral 

concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses 

jpmorgan chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions as a result the firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks the firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful 

in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the firm’s inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of its positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce the firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on the firm’s balance sheet thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the firm’s businesses 

liquidity risk 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses some potential conditions that could impair the firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption unforeseen cash or capital requirements including among others commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in the firm or financial markets in general these conditions may be caused by events over which the firm has little or no control the widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages credit card receivables and other assets and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future 

bank deposits are a stable and low cost source of funding if the firm does not successfully attract deposits because for example competitors raise the interest rates that they are willing to pay to depositors and accordingly customers move their deposits elsewhere the firm may need to replace such funding with more expensive funding which would reduce the firm’s net interest margin and net interest income 

 

debt obligations of jpmorgan chase  co jpmorgan chase bank na and certain of their subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies these credit ratings are important to maintaining the firm’s liquidity a reduction in these credit ratings could reduce the firm’s access to debt markets or materially increase the cost of issuing debt trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted contractually or otherwise to do business with or lend to the firm thereby curtailing the firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability reduction in the ratings of certain spes or other entities to which the firm has funding or other commitments could also impair the firm’s liquidity where such ratings changes lead directly or indirectly to the firm being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding 

critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream strong capital ratios leading market shares strong credit quality and risk management controls diverse funding sources and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures although the firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future for example the rating agencies have indicated they intend to reevaluate the credit ratings of systemically important financial institutions in light of the provisions of the doddfrank act that seek to eliminate any implicit government support for such institutions in addition several rating agencies have indicated that recent economic and geopolitical trends including deteriorating sovereign creditworthiness particularly in the eurozone elevated economic uncertainty and higher funding spreads could lead to downgrades in the credit ratings of many global banks including the firm any such downgrades from rating agencies if they affected the firm’s credit ratings may occur at times of broader market instability when the firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low 

as a holding company jpmorgan chase  co relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and consequently its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends loans or other payments several of jpmorgan chase  co’s principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments limitations in the payments that jpmorgan chase  co receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position 

some global regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in every country in which they operate and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries if adopted these requirements could hinder the firm’s ability to manage its liquidity efficiently 



part i 

legal risk 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties there is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future particularly with respect to litigation related to the issuance or underwriting by the firm of mortgagebacked securities “mbs” actions currently pending against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm which could materially adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm to the firm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that the firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations 

the firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations for example in january 2012 the us department of justice the new york state attorney general the secretary for housing and urban development and the sec announced the formation of the residential mortgagebacked securities working group to investigate “those responsible for misconduct contributing to the financial crisis” through the pooling and sale of residential mbs these and other initiatives from state and federal officials may subject the firm to additional judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause the firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities all of which could lead to reputational issues or higher operational costs thereby reducing the firm’s revenue 

business and operational risks 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchase and indemnity obligations 

in connection with the sale and securitization of loans whether with or without recourse the originator is generally required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized jpmorgan chase and some of its subsidiaries have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans and the firm will continue to do so when it securitizes loans it has originated if a loan that does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized the firm may be obligated to repurchase the loan and incur any associated loss directly or the firm may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses in 2010 and 2011 the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to us governmentsponsored entities “gses” such as fannie mae and freddie mac continued to be elevated and there is no assurance that such costs will not continue to be elevated in the future accordingly repurchase or indemnity obligations 

 

to the gses or to private thirdparty purchasers could materially and adversely affect the firm’s results of operations and earnings in the future 

the repurchase liability that the firm records with respect to its loan repurchase obligations is estimated based on several factors including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by purchasers the firm’s ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchases demands and the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure while the firm believes that its current repurchase liability reserves are adequate the factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments the economic environment and other circumstances accordingly such reserves may be increased in the future 

the firm also faces litigation related to securitizations primarily related to securitizations not sold to the gses the firm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves while the firm believes that its current reserves in respect of such litigation matters are adequate there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

jpmorgan chase may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that it satisfies requirements relating to mortgage foreclosures 

the firm has as described above entered into the consent orders with banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing foreclosure and lossmitigation activities and agreed to the global settlement with federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages the firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its efforts to enhance its mortgage origination servicing and foreclosure procedures including the enhancements required under the consent orders and the global settlement 

jpmorgan chase’s commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the firm to significant cost and liability 

jpmorgan chase engages in the storage transportation marketing or trading of several commodities including metals agricultural products crude oil oil products natural gas electric power emission credits coal freight and related products and indices the firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing developing and trading emission reduction credits as a result of all of these activities the firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy commodities environmental and other governmental laws and regulations the firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity and to restrict some of the firm’s activities which could result in lower revenues from the firm’s commodities activities in addition the firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these 



laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties furthermore liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations 

the firm’s commodities activities also further expose the firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events including natural disasters leaks spills explosions release of toxic substances fires accidents on land and at sea wars and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries loss of life property damage damage to the firm’s reputation and suspension of operations the firm’s commodities activities are also subject to disruptions many of which are outside of the firm’s control from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment transmission lines or other equipment or processes and the contractual failure of performance by thirdparty suppliers or service providers including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities the firm’s actions to mitigate its risks related to the abovementioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency in addition insurance covering some of these risks may not be available and the proceeds if any from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents as a result the firm’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events 

jpmorgan chase relies on its systems employees and certain counterparties and certain failures could materially adversely affect the firm’s operations 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are dependent on the firm’s ability to process record and monitor a large number of complex transactions if the firm’s financial accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially adversely affected the firm is similarly dependent on its employees the firm could be materially adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firm’s operations or systems third parties with which the firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the firm including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties’ own systems or employees any of these occurrences could diminish the firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients increased operating expenses higher litigation costs including fines and sanctions reputational damage regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing any of which could materially adversely affect the firm 

if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the firm’s possession were to be mishandled or misused the firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include 

 

circumstances where for example such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either through the fault of the firm’s systems employees or counterparties or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 

the firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the firm’s control which may include for example security breaches as discussed further below electrical or telecommunications outages failures of computer servers or other damage to the firm’s property or assets natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics or events arising from local or larger scale political events including terrorist acts such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the firm 

in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future as processes are changed or new products and services are introduced the firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes in addition there is the risk that the firm’s controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate any such failure could adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations by requiring the firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as by exposing the firm to litigation regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance 

a breach in the security of jpmorgan chase’s systems could disrupt its businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the firm 

although jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the firm’s computer systems software networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to the firm and its customers there is no assurance that all of the firm’s security measures will provide absolute security jpmorgan chase and other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means despite the firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems it is possible that the firm may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types 



part i 

especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties outside the firm such as persons involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of the firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the firm’s data or that of its customers or clients these risks may increase in the future as the firm continues to increase its mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings and expands its internal usage of webbased products and applications 

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the firm’s systems could cause serious negative consequences for the firm including significant disruption of the firm’s operations misappropriation of confidential information of the firm or that of its customers or damage to computers or systems of the firm and those of its customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to the firm or to its customers loss of confidence in the firm’s security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure and harm to the firm’s reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s international growth strategy may be hindered by local political social and economic factors and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks 

jpmorgan chase has expanded and plans to continue to grow its international wholesale businesses in europemiddle eastafrica “emea” asiapacific and latin americacaribbean as part of its international growth strategy the firm seeks to provide a wider range of financial services including cash management lending trade finance and corporate advisory services to its clients that conduct business in those regions in furtherance of these initiatives the firm is selectively expanding its existing international operations including through the addition of clientserving bankers and product and sales support personnel 

many of the countries in which jpmorgan chase intends to grow its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than the united states and other developed markets in which the firm operates some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation or low or negative growth among other negative conditions or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment in addition these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in and may in the future lead to social unrest 

 

general strikes and demonstrations outbreaks of hostilities overthrow of incumbent governments terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord all of which can adversely affect the firm’s operations or investments in such countries political social or economic disruption or dislocation in countries or regions in which the firm seeks to expand its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations and there can be no assurance that the firm will be able to successfully execute its international growth initiatives 

less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the firm’s operations in those countries including among others the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions 

conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems in addition the firm can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring its operations outside the united states to comply with us anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic monetary political legal and other developments in the united states and around the world 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various us and nonus regulatory authorities and agencies the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the united states and the return earned on those loans and investments changes in federal reserve policies as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of nonus central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies are beyond the firm’s control and consequently the impact of changes in these policies on the firm’s activities and results of operations is difficult to predict 



the firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and marketmaking in securities of companies worldwide these risks include among others risk of loss from unfavorable political legal or other developments including social or political instability expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations crime corruption war or military actions acts of terrorism and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in certain emerging markets 

revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can and has in the past affected the firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries including the firm’s operations in the united states as a result any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the firm’s business and results of operations 

several of the firm’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of us and nonus governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities these activities can expose the firm to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputational risks including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations 

further various countries in which the firm operates or invests or in which the firm may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to that country or region including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation or low or negative growth among other negative conditions concerns regarding the fiscal condition of certain countries within the eurozone continue and there is no assurance such concerns will not lead to “market contagion” beyond those countries in the eurozone or beyond the eurozone accordingly it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries even in countries in which the firm does not conduct business or have operations will adversely affect the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated 

jpmorgan chase has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business by acquiring other businesses there can be no assurance that the firm’s acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results including results relating to the total cost of integration the time required to complete the integration the amount of longerterm cost savings the overall performance of the combined entity or an improved 

 

price for jpmorgan chase  co’s common stock integration efforts could divert management attention and resources which could adversely affect the firm’s operations or results the firm cannot provide assurance that any such integration efforts would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses 

acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause the firm to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to competing financial institutions it is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of the firm’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect the firm’s ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and other business partners the loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect the firm’s ability to successfully conduct its business 

risk management 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the firm the firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which the firm is subject including liquidity risk credit risk market risk interest rate risk country risk private equity risk operational risk legal and fiduciary risk and reputational risk among others however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to the firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist or develop in the future risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified if the firm’s risk management framework proves ineffective the firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected as the firm’s businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve the firm’s risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes as a result there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified monitored or managed in addition in a difficult or less liquid market environment the firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for the firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants 

the firm’s products including loans leases lending commitments derivatives trading account assets and assets heldforsale expose the firm to credit risk as one of the nation’s largest lenders the firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties and the credit quality of the firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings the firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its 



part i 

credit exposure including unfunded lending commitments the firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the firm in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to the firm’s financial results and condition and require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations as is the case with any such assessments there is always the chance that the firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

jpmorgan chase’s marketmaking businesses may expose the firm to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause the firm to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative certain of the firm’s derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities commodities or obligations that the firm does not own if the firm is unable to obtain such securities commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays which could damage the firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business in addition in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis the firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default the firm may be exposed to market and operational losses in particular disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise which could force the firm to incur unexpected costs including transaction legal and litigation costs and impair the firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products 

many of the firm’s hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historical market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by the firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the firm’s risk management strategies causing the firm to incur losses the firm cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework including the firm’s underlying assumptions or strategies will at all times be accurate and effective 

 

other risks 

the financial services industry is highly competitive and jpmorgan chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued consolidation in the financial services industry produces larger bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices 

competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks hedge funds commodity trading companies private equity firms insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading the firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the firm’s products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share increased competition also may require the firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive these investments may increase expense or may require the firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions the firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations 

competitors of the firm’s nonus wholesale businesses are typically subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes for example the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the doddfrank act including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the volcker rule margin requirements for certain nonus derivatives transactions and the derivatives “pushout” rules have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the united states and may not be implemented into law in most countries the more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to us financial services institutions such as jpmorgan chase can put the firm at a competitive disadvantage to its nonus competitors including prohibiting the firm from engaging in certain transactions making the firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the firm’s cost 



structure for providing certain products all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the firm’s wholesale businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the firm’s performance 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are the firm’s most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense the imposition on the firm or its employees of certain existing and proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect the firm’s ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees if the firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees the firm’s performance including its competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if incorrect could cause unexpected losses in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states jpmorgan chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements including in determining allowances for credit losses mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigations among other items certain of the firm’s financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities availableforsale securities certain loans msrs private equity investments structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the firm’s financial statements where quoted market prices are not available the firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels making their valuation particularly subjective as they are based on significant estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment if assumptions or estimates underlying the firm’s financial statements are incorrect the firm may experience material losses 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could damage its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to the firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers investors and employees damage to the firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the firm’s business and prospects harm to the firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct compliance failures litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations in addition a failure to deliver 

 

appropriate standards of service and quality or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly can result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and harm to reputation for the firm adverse publicity regarding the firm whether or not true may result in harm to the firm’s prospects actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the firm’s reputation for example the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the firm’s reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the firm’s earnings and results of operations 

management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among the firm’s clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the firm or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions as well as cause serious reputational harm to the firm

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect jpmorgan chase’s financial condition and operations other factors that could affect the firm’s financial condition and operations are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section on page 157 however factors besides those discussed below in mda or elsewhere in this or other reports that jpmorgan chase filed or furnished with the sec also could adversely affect the firm readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by us and international financial market and economic conditions 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions including the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates and currency and commodities prices

investor sentiment events that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit the occurrence of natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and the health of us or international economies 

in the firm’s wholesale businesses the abovementioned factors can affect transactions involving the firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses the realization of cash returns from its private equity business the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its customers and therefore the revenue that the firm receives from commissions and spreads and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the firm 

the firm generally maintains large positions in the fixed income currency commodity and equity markets and from time to time the firm may have trading positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity the revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors including the firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets all of which are affected by economic and market conditions the firm anticipates that revenue relating to its trading and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such investments and that this could materially adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the fees that the firm earns for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets that the firm manages or holds in custody which in turn could affect the firm’s revenue macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the firm’s funds or accounts moreover even in the absence of a market downturn subpar performance by the firm’s investment management businesses could cause outflows of assets under management and therefore reduce the fees that the firm receives 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions including us interest rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies any deterioration in these conditions can diminish demand for the products and services of the firm’s consumer businesses or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment could lead to an increase in mortgage credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce the firm’s earnings 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could suffer 

jpmorgan chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses some potential conditions that could impair the firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise disrupted unforeseen cash or capital requirements including among others commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities difficulty in selling or

part i 

inability to sell assets unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in the firm or financial markets in general these conditions may be caused by events over which the firm has little or no control the widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages credit card receivables and other assets and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future 

the credit ratings of jpmorgan chase  co jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are important to maintaining the firm’s liquidity a reduction in their credit ratings could reduce the firm’s access to debt markets or materially increase the cost of issuing debt trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted contractually or otherwise to do business with or lend to the firm thereby curtailing the firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability reduction in the ratings of certain spes or other entities to which the firm has funding or other commitments could also impair the firm’s liquidity where such ratings changes lead directly or indirectly to the firm being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding 

critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream strong capital ratios strong credit quality and risk management controls diverse funding sources and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures although the firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future such downgrades may come at times of broader market instability when the firm’s options for responding to events are more limited and general investor confidence is low 

as a holding company jpmorgan chase  co relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and consequently its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends loans or other payments several of jpmorgan chase  co’s principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments limitations in the payments that jpmorgan chase  co receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position 

some global regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in every country in which they operate and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries if adopted these requirements could decrease the firm’s ability to manage and increase the risk of its liquidity positions 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and the firm’s business and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject including recentlyadopted legislation and regulations 

jpmorgan chase is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the united states as well as the applicable laws of each

of the various other jurisdictions outside the united states in which the firm does business these laws and regulations affect the way that the firm does business may restrict the scope of its existing businesses limit its ability to expand its product offerings or pursue acquisitions or make offering its products to clients more expensive 

extensive legislation affecting the financial services industry has recently been adopted in the united states and in other jurisdictions and regulations are in the process of being implemented in the united states the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was adopted in 2010 and will effect significant structural reforms to the financial services industry this legislation provides for among other things the establishment of a bureau of consumer financial protection which will have broad authority to regulate the credit savings payment and other consumer financial products and services that the firm offers the creation of a structure to regulate systemically important financial companies and provide regulators with the power to require such companies to sell or transfer assets and terminate activities if the regulators determine that the size or scope of activities of the company pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the company or the financial stability of the united states more comprehensive regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market including providing for higher capital and margin requirements the central clearing of standardized overthecounter derivatives and heightened supervision of all overthecounter derivatives dealers and major market participants including the firm socalled “push out” provisions that could require the firm to significantly restructure or restrict its derivatives businesses change the legal entities through which such businesses are conducted or limit the firm’s ability to manage collateral margin and other risks prohibitions on the firm engaging in certain proprietary trading activities and restricting its ownership of investment in or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds restrictions on the interchange fees that the firm earns on debit card transactions and a requirement that bank regulators phase out the treatment of trust preferred capital debt securities as tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes 

the european union “eu” has created a european systemic risk board to monitor financial stability and implemented rules that will increase capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and impose compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries in addition the eu commission is considering a wide array of other initiatives including new legislation that will affect derivatives trading impose surcharges on “globally” systemically important firms and possibly impose new levies on bank balance sheets 

the basel committee on banking supervision announced in december 2010 revisions to its capital accord which will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks narrow the definition of capital and introduce short term liquidity and term funding standards among other things also being considered is the imposition of a bank surcharge on institutions that are determined to be “globally significant financial institutions” these requirements could increase the firm’s funding and operational costs 

these and any additional legislative or regulatory actions in the united states or other countries and any required changes to the firm’s business operations resulting from such legislation and regulations could result in significant loss of revenue limit the firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging affect the value of assets that the firm holds require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products impose additional costs on the firm or otherwise adversely affect the firm’s businesses accordingly the firm cannot provide assurance that any such new legislation or regulations would not have an adverse effect on its business results of operations or financial condition in the future 

if the firm does not comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to its operations the firm may be subject to fines penalties or material restrictions on its businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred in recent years regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with the firm’s operations as this regulatory trend continues it could adversely affect the firm’s operations and in turn its financial results 

the financial condition of jpmorgan chase’s customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect the firm  

if the current economic environment were to deteriorate more of jpmorgan chase’s customers may become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the firm which in turn could result in a higher level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses or in requirements that the firm purchase assets from or provide other funding to its clients and counterparties any of which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition moreover a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the firm’s counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating the firm’s credit risk exposure and increasing the losses including marktomarket losses that the firm could incur in its trading and clearing businesses 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships the firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose the firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client which can be exacerbated during periods of market illiquidity during such periods the firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the collateral held by the firm cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to the firm in addition disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity periods of illiquidity as experienced in 2008 and early 2009 may occur again and could produce losses if the firm is unable to realize upon collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral 

concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses 

jpmorgan chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions as a result the firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks the firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful 

in addition increased concentration within the firm’s securities or loan portfolios or in other positions that the firm may hold may occur for reasons outside of the firm’s control disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the firm’s inability to sell syndicate or realize upon its positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce the firm’s positions not only increases the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increases the level of riskweighted assets on the firm’s balance sheet thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the firm’s businesses 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the firm the firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which the firm is subject including liquidity risk credit risk market risk interest rate risk operational risk legal and fiduciary risk reputational risk and private equity risk among others however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to the firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist or develop in the future risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified if the firm’s risk management framework proves ineffective the firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected as the firm’s businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve the firm’s risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes as a result there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified monitored or managed in addition in a difficult or less liquid market environment the firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for the firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants 

the firm’s products including loans leases lending commitments derivatives trading account assets and assets heldforsale expose the firm to credit risk as one of the nation’s largest lenders the firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties and the credit quality of the firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings the firm establishes reserves for probable credit losses

part i 

inherent in its credit exposure including unfunded lending commitments the firm also employs stress testing and other methods to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the firm in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to the firm’s financial results and condition and require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations as is the case with any such assessments there is always the chance that the firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies 

jpmorgan chase’s trading businesses may expose the firm to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause the firm to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a trading instrument such as a derivative certain of the firm’s derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities commodities or obligations that the firm does not own if the firm is unable to obtain such securities commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays which could damage the firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business in addition in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis the firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default the firm may be exposed to market and operational losses in particular disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivatives contracts could arise which could force the firm to incur unexpected costs including transaction legal and litigation costs and impair the firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products 

many of the firm’s hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historical market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by the firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the firm’s risk management strategies causing the firm to incur losses the firm cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework including the firm’s underlying assumptions or strategies will at all times be accurate and effective 

jpmorgan chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic monetary political legal and other developments in the united states and around the world 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various us and nonus regulatory authorities and agencies the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the united states and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of financial assets that the firm holds such as mortgage servicing rights “msrs” federal reserve board policies also can adversely affect the firm’s borrowers and counterparties potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to the firm changes in federal reserve board policies as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of nonus central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies are beyond the firm’s control and consequently the impact of changes in these policies on the firm’s activities and results of operations is difficult to predict 

the firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and trading in securities of companies worldwide these risks include among others risk of loss from unfavorable political legal or other developments including social or political instability expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations crime corruption war or military actions acts of terrorism and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in certain emerging markets 

revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can and has in the past affected the firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries including the firm’s operations in the united states as a result any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the firm’s business and results of operations 

several of the firm’s businesses engage in transactions with or trade in obligations of us and nonus governmental entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities these activities can expose the firm to enhanced sovereign creditrelated operational and reputational risks including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition and results of operations 

further various countries in which the firm operates or invests or in which the firm may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to that country or region including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation or low or negative growth among other negative conditions in 2010 concerns were raised about certain european countries including greece ireland italy portugal and spain regarding perceived weaknesses in their economic and fiscal

condition and how such weaknesses might affect other economies as well as financial institutions including the firm which lent funds to or did business with or in those countries there is always the chance that economic disruptions in other countries even in countries in which the firm does not conduct business or have operations will adversely affect the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchase and indemnity obligations 

in connection with the sale and securitization of loans whether with or without recourse the originator is generally required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized jpmorgan chase and some of its subsidiaries including those acquired through the bear stearns merger and the washington mutual transaction have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans and the firm will continue to do so when it securitizes loans it has originated if a loan that does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized the firm may be obligated to repurchase the loan and incur any associated loss directly or the firm may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses in 2010 the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to government agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac the “gses” increased substantially and there is no assurance that such costs could not continue to increase substantially in the future accordingly repurchase or indemnity obligations to the gses or to private thirdparty purchasers could materially and adversely affect the firm’s results of operations and earnings in the future 

the repurchase liability that the firm records with respect to its loan repurchase obligations is estimated based on several factors including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by purchasers the firm’s ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchases demands and the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure while the firm believes that its current repurchase liability reserves are adequate the factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments the economic environment and other circumstances accordingly such reserves may be increased in the future 

the firm also faces litigation related to securitizations primarily related to securitizations not sold to the gses the firm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves while the firm believes that its current reserves in respect of such litigation matters are adequate there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

jpmorgan chase may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that it satisfies requirements relating to mortgage foreclosures 

in late september 2010 jpmorgan chase commenced implementation of a temporary suspension of obtaining mortgage foreclosure judgments in the states and territories that require a judicial foreclosure process subsequently the firm extended this temporary suspension to foreclosure sales in those states and territories that require a judicial foreclosure process and to foreclosures and foreclosure sales in the majority of remaining

states where a judicial process is not required but where an affidavit signed by firm personnel may have been used as part of the foreclosure process in midoctober the firm also temporarily suspended evictions in the states and territories in which the firm had suspended foreclosures and foreclosure sales as well as in certain additional states in which an affidavit signed by firm personnel may have been used in connection with eviction proceedings 

this temporary suspension arose out of questions about affidavits of indebtedness prepared by local foreclosure counsel signed by firm employees and filed or used in mortgage foreclosure proceedings in certain states based on the firm’s work to date the firm believes that the information in those affidavits of indebtedness about the fact of default and amount of indebtedness was materially accurate however the underlying review and verification of this information was performed by personnel other than the affiants or the affidavits may not have been properly notarized the firm has since resumed filing new foreclosure actions in most of the states in which the firm had previously halted such actions using revised procedures in connection with the execution of the affidavits and other documents that may be used in the foreclosure process and the firm intends to resume filing new foreclosure actions in all remaining states the firm is also in the process of reviewing pending foreclosure matters to determine whether the remediation of previously filed affidavits or other documents is necessary and the firm intends to resume pending foreclosure proceedings as the review and if necessary remediation of each pending matter is completed 

the firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its efforts to correct and enhance its mortgage foreclosure procedures multiple state and federal officials have announced investigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks including jpmorgan chase and its affiliates relating to foreclosure and loss mitigation processes the firm is cooperating with these investigations and these investigations could result in material fines penalties equitable remedies including requiring default servicing or other process changes or other enforcement actions as well as significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations and additional litigation the firm cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters or the impact that they could have on the firm’s financial results 

jpmorgan chase’s commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the firm to significant cost and liability 

jpmorgan chase engages in the storage transportation marketing or trading of several commodities including metals agricultural products crude oil oil products natural gas electric power emission credits coal freight and related products and indices the firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing developing and trading emission reduction credits as a result of all of these activities the firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy commodities environmental and other governmental laws and regulations the firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity and to restrict some of the firm’s activities which could result in lower revenues from the firm’s commodities

part i 

activities in addition the firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties furthermore liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations 

the firm’s commodities activities also further expose the firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events including natural disasters leaks spills explosions release of toxic substances fires accidents on land and at sea wars and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries loss of life property damage damage to the firm’s reputation and suspension of operations the firm’s commodities activities are also subject to disruptions many of which are outside of the firm’s control from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment transmission lines or other equipment or processes and the contractual failure of performance by thirdparty suppliers or service providers including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities the firm’s actions to mitigate its risks related to the abovementioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency in addition insurance covering some of these risks may not be available and the proceeds if any from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents as a result the firm’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events 

damage to jpmorgan chase’s reputation could damage its businesses 

maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to the firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers investors and employees damage to the firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the firm’s business and prospects harm to the firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct compliance failures litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations in addition a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly can result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and harm to reputation for the firm adverse publicity regarding the firm whether or not true may result in harm to the firm’s prospects actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the firm’s reputation for example the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the firm’s reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the firm’s earnings and results of operations 

management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and

interests with and among the firm’s clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the firm or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions as well as cause serious reputational harm to the firm 

jpmorgan chase relies on its systems employees and certain counterparties and certain failures could materially adversely affect the firm’s operations 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses are dependent on the firm’s ability to process record and monitor a large number of complex transactions if the firm’s financial accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially adversely affected the firm is similarly dependent on its employees the firm could be materially adversely affected if one of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firm’s operations or systems third parties with which the firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the firm including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties’ own systems or employees any of these occurrences could diminish the firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients increased operating expenses higher litigation costs including fines and sanctions reputational damage regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing any of which could materially adversely affect the firm 

if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the firm’s possession were to be mishandled or misused the firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where for example such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of the firm’s systems employees or counterparties or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 

the firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the firm’s control which may include for example computer viruses electrical or telecommunications outages failures of computer servers or other damage to the firm’s property or assets natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics or events arising from local or larger scale political events including terrorist acts such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the firm 

in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future as processes are changed or new products and services are introduced the firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes in addition there is the risk that the firm’s controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate any such failure could adversely affect the firm’s business and results of operations by

requiring the firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as by exposing the firm to litigation regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies actions brought against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm which could materially adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm to the firm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that the firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations related to its businesses and operations 

the financial services industry is highly competitive and jpmorgan chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued consolidation in the financial services industry produces larger bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices 

competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks hedge funds commodity trading companies private equity firms insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading the firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the firm’s products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share increased competition also may require the firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive these investments may increase expense or may require the firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions the firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated 

jpmorgan chase has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business by acquiring other businesses there can be no assurance that the firm’s acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results including results relating to the total cost of integration the time required to complete the integration the amount of longerterm cost savings the overall performance of the combined entity or an improved price for jpmorgan chase  co’s common stock integration efforts could divert management attention and resources which could adversely affect the firm’s operations or results the firm cannot provide assurance that any integration efforts in connection with acquisitions already consummated or any new acquisitions would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses 

acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause the firm to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to competing financial institutions it is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of the firm’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect the firm’s ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and other business partners the loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect the firm’s ability to successfully conduct its business 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the firm’s performance 

jpmorgan chase’s employees are the firm’s most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense the imposition on the firm or its employees of certain existing and proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect the firm’s ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees if the firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees the firm’s performance including its competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if incorrect could cause unexpected losses in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states jpmorgan chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements including in determining credit loss reserves mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigations among other items certain of the firm’s financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities availableforsale securities certain loans msrs private equity investments structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the firm’s financial statements where quoted market prices are not available the firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels making their valuation particularly subjective as they are based on significant estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans

part i 

and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment if assumptions or estimates underlying the firm’s financial statements are incorrect the firm may experience material losses

in the united kingdom at december 31 2010 jpmorgan chase owned or leased approximately 47 million square feet of office space and owned a 424000 squarefoot operations center in december 2010 jpmorgan chase acquired a 999year leasehold interest in 25 bank street in london’s canary wharf with 10 million square feet of space 25 bank street will become the new european headquarters of the investment bank in 2012 in addition jpmorgan chase agreed to purchase 60 victoria embankment in 2011 a 518000 squarefoot office building the firm has been leasing since 1991 for further discussion see building purchase commitments in note 30 on page 278 

in 2008 jpmorgan chase acquired a 999year leasehold interest in land at london’s canary wharf and entered into a building agreement to develop the site and construct a european headquarters building however acquisition of 25 bank street allows the firm to

accelerate by four years the consolidation of its investment bank personnel in one location in december 2010 jpmorgan chase signed an amended building agreement to allow continued development of the canary wharf site for future use the amended terms extend the building agreement to october 30 2016

jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries also occupy offices and other administrative and operational facilities in the asia pacific region latin america and canada under various types of ownership and leasehold agreements aggregating approximately 53 million total square feet of space at december 31 2010 jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries lease significant administrative and operational facilities in india 18 million square feet and the philippines 10 million square feet 

the properties occupied by jpmorgan chase are used across all of the firm’s business segments and for corporate purposes jpmorgan chase continues to evaluate its current and projected space requirements and may determine from time to time that certain of its premises and facilities are no longer necessary for its operations there is no assurance that the firm will be able to dispose of any such excess premises or that it will not incur charges in connection with such dispositions such disposition costs may be material to the firm’s results of operations in a given period for a discussion of occupancy expense see the consolidated results of operations discussion on pages 59–63 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 31 2010 the firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in more than 10000 legal proceedings in the form of regulatorygovernment investigations as well as private civil litigations the litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings by both governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations these legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication arbitration or investigation and involve each of the firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust securities and consumer protection claims some of which present novel claims or legal theories the firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters 

the firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of reserves established for its legal proceedings is from 0 to approximately 45 billion at december 31 2010 this estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the firm is involved taking into account the firm’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made for certain cases the firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made the firm’s estimate involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages the existence of multiple defendants including the firm in many of such proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined the numerous yetunresolved issues in many of the proceedings including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings accordingly the firm’s estimate will change from

time to time and actual losses may be more than the current estimate 

the firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings the firm accrues for potential liability arising from such proceedings when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves and makes adjustments in such reserves upwards or downwards as appropriate based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel 

in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery the firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of the currently pending matters will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these pending matters will be or what the eventual loss fines penalties or impact related to each pending matter may be jpmorgan chase believes based upon its current knowledge after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the firm’s consolidated financial condition the firm notes however that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the firm as a result the outcome of a particular matter may be material to jpmorgan chase’s operating results for a particular period depending on among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of jpmorgan chase’s income for that period

the firm may from time to time enter into written trading plans under rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 to facilitate the repurchase of common stock and warrants in accordance with the repurchase program a rule 10b51 repurchase plan allows the firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common stock – for example during internal trading “blackout periods” all purchases under a rule 10b51 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the firm is not aware of material nonpublic information 

the authorization to repurchase common stock and warrants will be utilized at management’s discretion and the timing of purchases and the exact number of shares and warrants purchased is subject to various factors including market conditions legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity the firm’s capital position taking into account goodwill and intangibles internal capital generation and alternative potential investment opportunities the repurchase program does not include specific price targets or

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect our financial condition and operations other factors that could affect our financial condition and operations are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section on page 135 however factors besides those discussed below in mda or elsewhere in this or other reports that we filed or furnished with the sec also could adversely affect us you should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us 

our results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by us and international financial market and economic conditions 

our businesses have been and in the future will continue to be materially affected by economic and market conditions including factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates and currency and commodities prices investor sentiment corporate or other scandals that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation the availability and cost of capital and credit the occurrence of natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and the degree to which us or international economies are expanding or experiencing recessionary pressures these factors can affect among other things the activity levels of clients with respect to the size number and timing of transactions involving our investment and commercial banking businesses including our underwriting and advisory businesses the realization of cash returns from our private equity and principal investments businesses the volume of transactions that we execute for our customers and therefore the revenue we receive from commissions and spreads the number and size of underwritings we manage on behalf of clients and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by us

we generally maintain large trading portfolios in the fixed income currency commodity and equity markets and we may have from time to time significant positions including positions in securities in markets that lack pricing transparency or liquidity the revenue derived from marktomarket values of our businesses are affected by many factors including our credit standing our success in effectively hedging our market and other risks volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets and other economic and business factors we anticipate that revenue relating to our trading and principal investment businesses will continue to experience volatility and there can be no assurance that such volatility relating to the above factors or other conditions that may affect pricing or our ability to realize returns from such investments could not materially adversely affect our earnings 

the fees we earn for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets we manage or hold in custody which in turn could affect our revenue moreover even in the absence of a market downturn belowmarket or subpar performance by our investment management businesses could result in outflows of assets under management and supervision and therefore reduce the fees that we receive 

during 2008 us and global financial markets were extremely volatile and were materially and adversely affected by a significant lack of liquidity loss of confidence in the financial sector disruptions in the credit markets reduced business activity rising unemployment declining home prices and erosion of consumer confidence these factors contributed to adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in 2008 and into early 2009 while the business environment stabilized during the latter half of 2009 the current economic environment remains weak which affects our businesses’ profitability 

our consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions such conditions include us interest rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others the deterioration of these conditions can diminish demand for the consumer businesses’ products and services or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as declines in home prices could lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can adversely affect our earnings 

during 2008 and continuing in 2009 higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased resolution costs of the federal deposit insurance corporation and depleted the deposit insurance fund in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund the fdic has increased assessment rates of insured institutions and adopted a rule in november 2009 requiring banks to prepay three years’ worth of premiums to replenish the depleted insurance fund if there are additional bank or financial institutions failures we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums than the recently increased levels any future increases of fdic insurance premiums may adversely impact our earnings 

in connection with the sale and securitization of loans whether with or without recourse the originator is generally required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized we and certain of our subsidiaries as well as entities acquired by us as part of the bear stearns merger and the washington mutual and other transactions have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans and we will continue to do so in the ordinary course of our lending business 

if a loan does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses in 2009 the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to government agencies such as freddie mac and fannie mae increased substantially and could continue to increase substantially further accordingly repurchase andor indemnity obligations to governmentsponsored enterprises or to private thirdparty purchasers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and earnings in the future 

we cannot provide assurance that any of the abovementioned conditions or further continued deterioration in economic market or business conditions will not have a material negative effect on the firm in the future 

if we do not effectively manage our liquidity our business could be negatively affected 

our liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses grow and be profitable some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets diminished access to capital markets unforeseen cash or capital requirements including among others commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities difficulty or inability to sell assets unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in us or our prospects these conditions may be caused by events over which we have little or no control for example the liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased our cost of funding and limited our access to some of our traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages loans credit card receivables and other assets these or other conditions detrimental to our liquidity may occur in the future

the credit ratings of jpmorgan chase  co jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are important in order to maintain our liquidity a reduction in their credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our access to liquidity sources increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing our profitability reduction in the ratings of certain spes or other entities to which we have a funding or other commitment could also negatively affect our liquidity where such ratings changes lead directly or indirectly to us being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream strong capital ratios strong credit quality and risk management controls diverse funding sources and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures 

our cost of obtaining longterm unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads the amount in excess of the interest rate of us treasury securities or other benchmark securities of the same maturity that we need to pay to our debt investors increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of this funding changes in credit spreads are continuous and marketdriven and influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness as such our credit spreads may be unpredictable and highly volatile 

part i 

as a holding company we rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries for our cash flow and consequent ability to pay dividends and satisfy our obligations these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends loans or other payments several of our principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments limitations in the payments we receive from our subsidiaries could negatively affect our liquidity position

the financial condition of our customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

a number of our products expose us to credit risk including loans leases and lending commitments derivatives trading account assets and assets heldforsale as one of the nation’s largest lenders we have exposures to many different products and counterparties and the credit quality of our exposures can have a significant impact on our earnings we estimate and establish reserves for credit risks and potential credit losses inherent in our credit exposure including unfunded lending commitments this process which is critical to our financial results and condition requires difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans as is the case with any such assessments there is always the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that we identify any such failure could result in increases in delinquencies and default rates

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by the counterparty or client which can be exacerbated during periods of market illiquidity such as experienced in 2008 and early 2009 during such periods our credit risk also may be further increased when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us in addition disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increases in times of market stress and illiquidity we cannot provide assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings

an example of the risks associated with our relationships with other financial institutions is the collapse of lehman brothers holdings inc “lbhi” on september 15 2008 lbhi filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code the “bankruptcy code” in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york and thereafter several of its subsidiaries also filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code lbhi and such subsidiaries collectively “lehman” on september 19 2008 a liquidation case under the securities investor protection act “sipa” was commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york for lehman brothers inc “lbi” lbhi’s us brokerdealer subsidiary and that court now presides over the lbi sipa liquidation case we were lbi’s clearing bank and

among other actions made collateral calls totaling approximately 8 billion in september 2008 and liquidated approximately 18 billion of securities subsequent to lehman’s bankruptcy filing we are the largest secured creditor in the lehman and lbi cases according to lehman’s schedules it is possible that claims may be asserted against us andor our security interests including by the lbhi creditors committee the sipa trustee appointed in the lbi liquidation case the principal acquirer of lbi’s assets and others in connection with lehman and lbi cases we intend to defend ourself against any such claims the lbhi examiner has filed a report with the bankruptcy court regarding his investigation into the collapse of lehman the report remains under seal

if the current weak economic environment continues for an extended period of time or deteriorates further there is a greater likelihood that more of our customers or counterparties could become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to us which in turn could result in a higher level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses or requirements that we purchase assets or provide other funding any of which could adversely affect our financial condition moreover a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure and increasing the losses including marktomarket losses we could incur in our trading and clearing businesses

concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses 

we have exposure to increased levels of risk when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions we regularly monitor various segments of our portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks our efforts to diversify or hedge our credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful and any concentration of credit risk could increase the potential for significant losses in our credit portfolio in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize upon securities loans or other instruments or positions held by us thereby leading to increased concentrations of such positions these concentrations could expose us to losses if the marktomarket value of the securities loans or other instruments or positions decline causing us to take write downs moreover the inability to reduce our positions not only increases the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increases the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing our capital requirements and funding costs all of which could adversely affect our businesses’ operations and profitability

our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us 

our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject including liquidity risk credit risk market

risk interest rate risk operational risk legal and fiduciary risk reputational risks and private equity risk among others however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist or develop in the future risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified if our risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

our risk management strategies may not be effective because in a difficult or less liquid market environment other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the difficult market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for us to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants 

our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument in addition certain of our derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities commodities or obligations that we do not own if we are not able to obtain such securities commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause us to forfeit payments otherwise due to us and could result in settlement delays which could damage our reputation and ability to transact future business in addition in situations where derivatives transactions are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis we may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default we may find the contract more difficult to enforce further as new and more complex derivative products are created disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of the contracts could arise which could force us to incur unexpected costs including transaction and legal costs and impair our ability to manage effectively our risk exposure from these products 

many of our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historic market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by us are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress such as occurred during 2008 or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of our risk management strategies causing us to incur losses in addition as our businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes for example there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified monitored or managed we cannot provide 

assurance that our risk management framework including our underlying assumptions or strategies will at all times be accurate and effective 

our operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic monetary political legal and other developments in the united states and around the world 

our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states nonus governments and international agencies

the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of financial assets that we hold such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights “msrs” its policies also can adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us changes in federal reserve board policies are beyond our control and consequently the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict 

our businesses and revenue are also subject to the risks inherent in maintaining international operations and in investing and trading in securities of companies worldwide these risks include among others risk of loss from the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism and various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations further various countries in which we operate or invest or in which we may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to that country or region including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation or low or negative growth among other negative conditions crime corruption war or military actions acts of terrorism and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in some of these countries particularly in certain emerging markets revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can and has in the past affected our operations and investments in another country or countries including our operations in the us any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our power generation and commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose us to significant cost and liability 

we engage in power generation and in connection with the commodities activities of our investment bank we engage in the storage transportation marketing or trading of several

part i 

commodities including metals agricultural products crude oil oil products natural gas electric power emission credits coal freight and related products and indices we have also invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing developing and trading emission reduction credits as a result of these activities we are subject to extensive and evolving energy commodities environmental and other governmental laws and regulations we expect laws and regulations affecting our power generation and commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity we may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties in addition liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations our power generation and commodities activities also further exposes us to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events including natural disasters leaks spills explosions release of toxic substances fires accidents on land and at sea wars and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries loss of life property damage damage to our reputation and suspension of operations in addition our power generation activities are subject to disruptions many of which are outside of our control from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment transmission lines or other equipment or processes and the contractual failure of performance by thirdparty suppliers or service providers including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities our actions to mitigate our risks related to the abovementioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency in addition insurance covering some of these risks may not be available and the proceeds if any from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents as a result our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events

we rely on our systems employees and certain counterparties and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations 

our businesses are dependent on our ability to process record and monitor a large number of increasingly complex transactions if any of our financial accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings we could be materially adversely affected we are similarly dependent on our employees we could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties’ own systems or employees any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses or result in potential liability to clients reputational damage and regulatory intervention any of which could materially adversely affect us

if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession were to be mishandled or misused we could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where for example such information was erroneously provided to 

parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of our systems employees or counterparties or such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 

we may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which may include for example computer viruses electrical or telecommunications outages or other damage to our property or assets natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics or events arising from local or larger scale political events including terrorist acts such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to us 

in a firm as large and complex as ours lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future in addition there is the risk that our controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate any such failure could adversely affect our operations and results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as by exposing us to litigation regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance 

we operate within a highly regulated industry and our business and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject 

we are subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the us as well as the applicable laws of each of the various other jurisdictions outside the us in which we do business these laws and regulations affect the type and manner in which we do business and may limit our ability to expand our product offerings pursue acquisitions or restrict the scope of operations and services provided

recent market and economic conditions have led to new legislation and numerous proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry including significant additional legislation and regulation in the united states for example new legislation and regulation affecting the credit card industry is expected to adversely affect our card services business by reducing revenue and increasing compliance costs 

recent proposals for further regulation of financial institutions both domestically and internationally include calls to increase their capital and liquidity requirements limit the size and types of the activities permitted and increase taxes on some institutions for example the “wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2009” recently passed by the us house of representatives would among other things establish a consumer financial protection agency having broad authority to regulate providers of credit savings payment and other consumer financial products and services as well as create a structure to regulate systemically important financial companies and provide regulators with the power to require such companies to sell or transfer assets and terminate activities if the regulators determine that the size or scope of activities of the company pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the company or the financial stability of the united states also proposed is more comprehensive regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market including providing for 

more strict capital and margin requirements the central clearing of standardized overthecounter derivatives and heightened supervision of all overthecounter derivatives dealers and major market participants including the firm 

these new and other legislative and regulatory changes could result in significant loss of revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impact the value of assets that we hold require us to change certain of our business practices impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our businesses accordingly we cannot provide assurance that any such new legislation or regulation would not have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we do not comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our operations we may be subject to fines penalties or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred in recent years regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations as this regulatory trend continues it could adversely affect our operations and in turn our financial results 

we face significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us 

we are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to us which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operation or cause us serious reputational harm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely we will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations related to our businesses and operations

there is increasing competition in the financial services industry which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices

we also face an increasing array of competitors competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks hedge funds private equity firms insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic 

and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of our products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for our products and services or may cause us to lose market share increased competition also may require us to make additional capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive these investments may increase expense or may require us to extend more of our capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions we cannot provide assurance that the significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations 

our acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated 

we have in the past and may in the future seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses there can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results including results relating to the total cost of integration the time required to complete the integration the amount of longerterm cost savings the overall performance of the combined entity or an improved price for our common stock integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls as well as managing relevant relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners integration efforts could divert management attention and resources which could adversely affect our operations or results we cannot provide assurance that any integration efforts of acquisitions already consummated or any new acquisitions would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses

we may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take additional markdowns and allowances for loan losses on the assets and loans acquired in the merger the “bear stearns merger” by jpmorgan chase and the bear stearns companies inc “bear stearns” and in connection with the acquisition of washington mutual bank’s “washington mutual” banking operations the “washington mutual transaction” we cannot assure you that as our integration efforts continue in connection with these transactions other unanticipated costs or losses will not be incurred 

acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions it is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees the loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business 

damage to our reputation could damage our businesses 

maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers investors and employees damage to our

part i 

reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures unethical behavior and the activities of customers and counterparties further negative publicity regarding us whether or not true may result in harm to our prospects

actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect our reputation for example the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole 

we could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our employees are our most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense the imposition on us or on our employees of certain of the currently proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees if we are unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees our performance including our competitive position could be materially adversely affected

our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if wrong could cause unexpected losses in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements including in determining credit loss reserves reserves related to litigations and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities among other items if assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect we may experience material losses

certain of our financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities availableforsale securities certain loans msrs private equity investments structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels making their valuation particularly subjective being based on significant estimation 

and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings

the debtors submitted claims substantially similar to those submitted in the bankruptcy court in the fdic receivership for among other things ownership of certain disputed assets as well as claims challenging the terms of the agreement pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of washington mutual bank were sold by the fdic to jpmorgan chase the fdic as receiver disallowed the debtors’ claims and the debtors filed an action against the fdic in the united states district court for the district of columbia challenging the fdic’s disallowance of the debtors’ claims claiming ownership of the disputed assets and seeking money damages from the fdic jpmorgan chase has intervened in the action on january 7 2010 the district court stayed the action pending developments in the bankruptcy court and ordered the parties to submit a joint status report every 120 days in connection with the stay the district court denied wmi’s and the fdic’s motions to dismiss without prejudice 

in addition the debtors moved in the bankruptcy court to take discovery from jpmorgan chase purportedly related to a litigation originally filed in the 122nd state district court of galveston county texas the “texas action” jpmorgan chase opposed the motion but the bankruptcy court ordered that the discovery proceed debtors are also seeking related discovery from various third parties including several government agencies plaintiffs in the texas action are certain holders of wmi common stock and the debt of wmi and washington mutual bank who have sued jpmorgan chase for unspecified damages alleging that jpmorgan 

chase acquired substantially all of the assets of washington mutual bank from the fdic at an allegedly too low price the fdic intervened in the texas action had it removed to the united states district court for the southern district of texas and then the fdic and jpmorgan chase moved to have the texas action dismissed or transferred the court transferred the texas action to the district of columbia plaintiffs have moved to have the fdic dismissed as a party and to remand the action to the state court or in the alternative dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction jpmorgan chase and the fdic have moved to have the entire action dismissed the motions to dismiss are fully briefed 

other proceedings related to washington mutual’s failure also pending before the united states district court for the district of columbia include a lawsuit brought by deutsche bank national trust company against the fdic alleging breach of various mortgage securitization agreements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain wmi subsidiaries in connection with those securitization agreements jpmorgan chase has not been named a party to the deutsche bank litigation but the complaint includes assertions that jpmorgan chase may have assumed certain liabilities

enron litigation jpmorgan chase and certain of its officers and directors are involved in several lawsuits arising out of its banking relationships with enron corp and its subsidiaries “enron” a number of actions and other proceedings against the firm have been resolved including a class action lawsuit captioned newby v enron corp and adversary proceedings brought by enron’s bankruptcy estate the remaining enronrelated actions include individual actions by enron investors creditors and counterparties 

part i 

the remaining litigation also includes a suit against jpmorgan chase alleging in relevant part breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty based upon the firm’s role as indenture trustee in connection with an indenture agreement between jpmorgan chase and enron the case has been dismissed but plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal and their appeal is pending before the new york state court of appeals 

a putative class action on behalf of jpmorgan chase employees who participated in the firm’s 401k plan asserted claims under the employee retirement income security act “erisa” for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and negligence by jpmorgan chase its directors and named officers plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and the firm’s motion for judgment on the pleadings are both fully briefed 

ipo allocation litigation jpmorgan chase and certain of its securities subsidiaries were named along with numerous other firms in the securities industry as defendants in a large number of putative class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging improprieties in connection with the allocation of securities in various public offerings including some offerings for which a jpmorgan chase entity served as an underwriter they also claim violations of securities laws arising from alleged material misstatements and omissions in registration statements and prospectuses for the initial public offerings “ipos” and alleged market manipulation with respect to aftermarket transactions in the offered securities bear stearns  co inc is named as a defendant in a little less than a third of the pending ipo securities cases antitrust lawsuits based on similar allegations have been dismissed with prejudice a settlement was reached in the securities cases which the district court approved the firm’s share of the settlement is approximately 62 million appeals and a 

petition for leave to appeal have been filed in the united states court of appeals for the second circuit seeking reversal of the decision approving the settlement 

in addition to the various cases proceedings and investigations discussed above jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or otherwise involved in a number of other legal actions and governmental proceedings arising in connection with their businesses additional actions investigations or proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the cases present novel legal theories involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery the firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss fines penalties or impact related to each pending matter may be jpmorgan chase believes based upon its current knowledge after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves that the outcome of the legal actions proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the firm’s consolidated financial condition however in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings actions and investigations there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the firm as a result the outcome of a particular matter may be material to jpmorgan chase’s operating results for a particular period depending on among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of jpmorgan chase’s income for that period

permissible business activities jpmorgan chase elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act “glba” under regulations implemented by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve board may impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies in addition the federal reserve board may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies 

persist the regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve board must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies at december 31 2008 the depositoryinstitution subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the firm to conduct the broader activities permitted under glba however there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 

financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board before they may acquire more than five percent of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank pursuant to the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “riegleneal act” the federal reserve board may approve an application for such an acquisition without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under the law of any state provided that the acquiring bank holding company before or after the acquisition does not control more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us or more than 30 or such greater or lesser amounts as permitted under state law of the total deposits of insured depository institutions in the state in which the acquired bank has its home office or a branch 

regulation by federal reserve board under glba under glba’s system of “functional regulation” the federal reserve board acts as an “umbrella regulator ” and certain of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based upon the particular activities of those subsidiaries jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” see “other supervision and regulation” below for a further description of the regulatory supervision to which the firm’s subsidiaries are subject 

dividend restrictions federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks dividends payable by jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na as national bank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided profits” see note 29 on page 199 for the amount of dividends that the firm’s principal bank subsidiaries could pay at january 1 2009 and 2008 to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators 

in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the occ the federal reserve board and the fdic have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including jpmorgan chase and its bank and bank holding 

company subsidiaries if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization 

for a discussion of additional dividend restrictions relating to the capital purchase program see capital purchase program on page 72 

capital requirements federal banking regulators have adopted riskbased capital and leverage guidelines that require the firm’s capitaltoassets ratios to meet certain minimum standards 

the riskbased capital ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off–balance sheet financial instruments into four weighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk under the guidelines capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital under the guidelines banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio total capital to riskweighted assets of 8 and a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 

the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets which reflects adjustments for disallowed goodwill and certain intangible assets the minimum leverage ratio is 3 for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under federal reserve board guidelines or which have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile and growth plans 

the minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision in 2004 the basel committee published a revision to the accord “basel ii” us banking regulators published a final basel ii rule in december 2007 which requires jpmorgan chase to implement basel ii at the holding company level as well as at certain of its key us bank subsidiaries for additional information regarding basel ii see regulatory capital on page 72 

effective january 1 2008 the sec authorized jpmorgan securities to use the alternative method of computing net capital for brokerdealers that are part of consolidated supervised entities as defined by sec rules accordingly jpmorgan securities may calculate deductions for market risk using its internal market risk models for additional information regarding the firm’s regulatory capital see regulatory capital on pages 71–73 and note 30 on pages 200–201 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by their federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as jpmorgan chase however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to glba the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based upon the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee 

deposit insurance under current fdic regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital and supervisory measures a depository institution is assessed insurance premiums by the fdic based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held during the fourth quarter 2008 the amount of fdic insurance coverage for insured deposits was increased under the eesa generally from 100000 per depositor to 250000 per depositor and pursuant to the firm’s participation in the fdic’s tlg program insured deposits held in noninterestbearing transaction accounts are now fully insured these increases in insurance coverage are scheduled to end on december 31 2009 the fdic has stated its intention as part of its proposed deposit insurance fund restoration plan to increase deposit insurance assessments on january 1 2009 the fdic increased its assessment rates and has proposed further rate increases and changes to the current riskbased assessment framework in addition as a result of the firm’s participation in the tlg program the firm is required to pay additional insurance premiums to the fdic in an amount equal to an annualized 10basis points on balances in noninterestbearing transaction accounts that exceed the 250000 deposit insurance limit determined on a quarterly basis 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured depository institution an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with such institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution 

if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power 1 to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors 2 to enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or 3 to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution the above provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na including without limitation obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued by 

part i 

those banks to investors referred to below as “public note holders” in the public markets 

under federal law the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including public noteholders and depositors in nonus offices in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of the institution as a result whether or not the fdic would ever seek to repudiate any obligations held by public noteholders or depositors in nonus offices of any subsidiary of the firm that is an insured depository institution such as jpmorgan chase bank na or chase bank usa na such persons would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in us offices of the depository 

the bank secrecy act the bank secrecy act “bsa” requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things establish a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism the bsa includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligenceknowyourcustomer documentation requirements the firm has established a global antimoney laundering program in order to comply with bsa requirements 

other supervision and regulation under current federal reserve board policy jpmorgan chase is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support these subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy however because glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators glba prohibits the federal reserve board from requiring payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to such payment in such a case the federal reserve board could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture 

the bank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to and certain other transactions with the firm and certain other affiliates and on investments in stock or securities of jpmorgan chase and those affiliates these restrictions prevent jpmorgan chase and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary unless the loans are secured in specified amounts see note 29 on page 199 

the firm’s banks and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to direct supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities some of which are considered “functional regulators” under glba jpmorgan chase’s national bank subsidiaries such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are subject to supervision and regulation by the occ and in certain matters by the federal reserve board and the fdic supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of the relevant 

bank’s business and condition and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments among other powers 

the firm conducts securities underwriting dealing and brokerage activities in the us through jpmorgan securities and other brokerdealer subsidiaries all of which are subject to regulations of the sec the financial industry regulatory authority and the new york stock exchange among others the firm conducts similar securities activities outside the us subject to local regulatory requirements the operations of jpmorgan chase mutual funds also are subject to regulation by the sec 

the firm has subsidiaries that are members of futures exchanges in the us and abroad and are registered accordingly in the us three subsidiaries are registered as futures commission merchants with other subsidiaries registered with the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors these cftcregistered subsidiaries are also members of the national futures association the firm’s us energy business is subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission it is also subject to other extensive and evolving energy commodities environmental and other governmental regulation both in the us and other jurisdictions globally 

the types of activities in which the nonus branches of jpmorgan chase bank na and the international subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board those nonus branches and international subsidiaries also are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate 

the activities of jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various us federal laws including the truthinlending equal credit opportunity fair credit reporting fair debt collection practice and electronic funds transfer acts as well as various state laws these statutes impose requirements on consumer loan origination and collection practices 

under the requirements imposed by glba jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are required periodically to disclose to their retail customers the firm’s policies and practices with respect to the sharing of nonpublic customer information with jpmorgan chase affiliates and others and the confidentiality and security of that information under glba retail customers also must be given the opportunity to “opt out” of informationsharing arrangements with nonaffiliates subject to certain exceptions set forth in glba 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect our financial condition and operations other factors that could affect our financial condition and operations are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section on page 115 however factors besides those discussed below in mda or elsewhere in this or other reports that we filed or furnished with the sec also could adversely affect us you should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us 

our results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by us and international financial market and economic conditions our businesses have been and in the future will continue to be materially affected by economic and market conditions including factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates and currency and commodities prices investor sentiment corporate or other scandals that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation the availability and cost of capital and credit the occurrence of natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and the degree to which us or international economies are expanding or experiencing recessionary pressures these factors can affect among other things the activity level of clients with respect to the size number and timing of transactions involving our investment and commercial banking businesses including our underwriting and advisory businesses the realization of cash returns from our private equity and principal investments businesses the volume of transactions that we execute for our customers and therefore the revenue we receive from commissions and spreads the number or size of underwritings we manage on behalf of clients and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by us 

we generally maintain large trading portfolios in the fixed income currency commodity and equity markets and we may have from time to time significant investment positions including positions in securities in markets that lack pricing transparency or liquidity the revenue derived from marktomarket values of our businesses are affected by many factors including our credit standing our success in proprietary positioning volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets and other economic and business factors we anticipate that revenue relating to our trading and principal investment businesses will continue to experience volatility and there can be no assurance that such volatility relating to the above factors or other conditions that may affect pricing or our ability to realize returns from such investments could not materially adversely affect our earnings 

the fees we earn for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets we manage or hold in custody which in turn could affect our revenue moreover even in the absence of a market downturn belowmarket or subpar performance by our investment management businesses could result in outflows of assets under management and supervision and therefore reduce the fees that we receive 

our consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions such conditions include us interest rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others the deterioration of these conditions can diminish demand for the consumer businesses’ products and services or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as declines in home prices could lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can adversely affect our earnings 

during 2008 us and global financial markets were extremely volatile and were materially and adversely affected by a significant lack of liquidity loss of confidence in the financial 

sector disruptions in the credit markets reduced business activity rising unemployment declining home prices and erosion of consumer confidence these factors contributed to adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in 2008 and there is no assurance when such conditions will ameliorate 

if we do not effectively manage our liquidity our business could be negatively affected our liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses grow and be profitable some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets diminished access to capital markets unforeseen cash or capital requirements including among others commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities difficulty or inability to sell assets unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in us or our prospects these conditions may be caused by events over which we have little or no control the liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 increased our cost of funding and limited our access to some of our traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages loans credit card receivables and other assets if current market conditions continue our liquidity could be adversely affected 

the credit ratings of jpmorgan chase  co jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are important in order to maintain our liquidity a reduction in their credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our access to liquidity sources increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing our profitability reduction in the ratings of certain spes or other entities to which we have a funding or other commitment could also negatively affect our liquidity where such ratings changes lead directly or indirectly to us being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream strong capital ratios strong credit quality and risk management controls diverse funding sources and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures 

our cost of obtaining longterm unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads the amount in excess of the interest rate of us treasury securities or other benchmark securities of the same maturity that we need to pay to our debt investors increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of this funding changes in credit spreads are continuous and marketdriven and influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness as such our credit spreads may be unpredictable and highly volatile 

as a holding company we rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries for our cash flow and consequent ability to pay dividends and satisfy our obligations these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends loans or other payments several of our principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments limitations in the payments we receive from our subsidiaries could negatively affect our liquidity position 

the soundness of our customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect us  a number of our products expose us to credit risk including loans leases and lending commitments derivatives trading account assets and assets heldforsale as one of the nation’s largest lenders we have exposures to many different 

part i 

products and counterparties and the credit quality of our exposures can have a significant impact on our earnings we estimate and establish reserves for credit risks and potential credit losses inherent in our credit exposure including unfunded lending commitments this process which is critical to our financial results and condition requires difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans as is the case with any such assessments there is always the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that we identify any such failure could result in increases in delinquencies and default rates 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by the counterparty or client which can be exacerbated during periods of market illiquidity such as experienced in 2008 during such periods our credit risk also may be further increased when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us in addition disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increases in times of market stress and illiquidity there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings 

as an example of the risks associated with our relationships with other financial institutions is the collapse of lehman brothers holdings inc “lbhi” on september 15 2008 lbhi filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code the “bankruptcy code” in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york and thereafter several of its subsidiaries also filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the court lbhi and such subsidiaries collectively “lehman” on september 19 2008 a liquidation case under the securities investor protection act was commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york for lehman brothers inc “lbi” lbhi’s us brokerdealer subsidiary and the court now presides over the lbi sipa liquidation case we were lbi’s clearing bank and are the largest secured creditor in the lehman and lbi cases according to lehman’s schedules we anticipate that claims may be asserted against us andor our security interests including by the lbhi creditors committee the sipa trustee appointed in the lbi liquidation case the principal acquiror of lbi’s assets and others in connection with lehman and lbi cases we intend to defend ourself against any such claims 

as a result of the current economic environment there is a greater likelihood that more of our customers or counterparties could become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to us which in turn could result in a higher level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses or requirements that we purchase assets or provide other funding any of which could adversely affect our financial condition moreover a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure and increasing the losses including marktomarket losses we could incur in our trading clearing and proprietary businesses 

concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses we have exposure to increased levels of risk when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions we regularly monitor various segments of our portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks our efforts to diversify or hedge our credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful and any concentration of credit risk could increase the potential for significant losses in our credit portfolio in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize upon securities loans or other instruments or positions held by us thereby leading to increased concentrations

of such positions these concentrations could expose us to losses if the marktomarket value of the securities loans or other instruments or positions decline causing us to take write downs moreover the inability to reduce our positions not only increases the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increases the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing our capital requirements and funding costs all of which could adversely affect our businesses’ operations and profitability 

our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject including liquidity risk credit risk market risk interest rate risk operational risk legal and fiduciary risk reputational risk and private equity risk among others however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist or develop in the future risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified if our risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

our risk management strategies may not be effective because in a difficult or less liquid market environment other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the difficult market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for us to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants

our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument in addition certain of our derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities commodities or obligations that we do now own if we are not able to obtain such securities commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause us to forfeit payments otherwise due to us and could result in settlement delays which could damage our reputation and ability to transact future business in addition many derivative transactions are not cleared and settled through a central clearinghouse or exchange and they may not always be confirmed or settled by counterparties on a timely basis in these situations we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default we may find the contract more difficult to enforce further as new and more complex derivative products are created disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of the contracts could arise which could force us to incur unexpected costs including transaction and legal costs and impair our ability to manage effectively our risk exposure from these products 

many of our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historic market behavior and all 

such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by us are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress such as occurred during 2008 or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of our risk management strategies causing us to incur losses in addition as our businesses grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes for example there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified monitored or managed there can be no assurance that our risk management framework including our underlying assumptions or strategies will at all times be accurate and effective 

our operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic monetary political legal and other developments in the united states and around the world our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states nonus governments and international agencies 

the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of financial assets that we hold such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights “msrs” its policies also can adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us changes in federal reserve policies are beyond our control and consequently the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict 

our businesses and revenue are also subject to the risks inherent in maintaining international operations and in investing and trading in securities of companies worldwide these risks include among others risk of loss from the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism and various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations further various countries in which we operate or invest or in which we may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation or low or negative growth among other negative conditions crime corruption war or military actions acts of terrorism and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in some of these countries particularly in the emerging markets revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result 

of the above considerations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can and has in the past affected our operations and investments in another country or countries any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the emergence of a widespread health emergency or pandemic also could create economic or financial disruption that could negatively affect our revenue and operations or impair our ability to manage our businesses in certain parts of the world 

our power generation and commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose it to significant cost and liability we engage in power generation and in connection with the commodities activities of our investment bank we engage in the storage transportation marketing or trading of several commodities including metals agricultural products crude oil oil products natural gas electric power emission credits coal freight and related products and indices as a result of these activities we are subject to extensive and evolving energy commodities environmental and other governmental laws and regulations we expect laws and regulations affecting our power generation and commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity we may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties in addition liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations our power generation and commodities activities also further exposes us to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events including natural disasters leaks spills explosions release of toxic substances fires accidents on land and at sea wars and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries loss of life property damage damage to our reputation and suspension of operations in addition our power generation activities are subject to disruptions many of which are outside of our control from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment transmission lines or other equipment or processes and the contractual failure of performance by thirdparty suppliers or service providers including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities we attempt to mitigate our risks but our actions may not prove adequate to address every contingency in addition insurance covering some of these risks may not be available and the proceeds if any from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents as a result our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events 

we rely on our systems employees and certain counterparties and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations our businesses are dependent on our ability to process record and monitor a large number of increasingly complex transactions if any of our financial accounting or other data 

part i 

processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings we could be materially adversely affected we are similarly dependent on our employees we could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties’ own systems or employees any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses or result in potential liability to clients reputational damage and regulatory intervention any of which could materially adversely affect us 

if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession were to be mishandled or misused we could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include for example if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of our systems employees or counterparties or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 

we may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which may include for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets or events arising from local or larger scale politics including terrorist acts such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to us 

in a firm as large and complex as us lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future in addition there is the risk that our controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate any such failure could affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as by exposing us to litigation regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance 

we operate within a highly regulated industry and our business and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject we operate within a highly regulated industry we are subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the us as well as the applicable laws of each of the various other jurisdictions outside the us in which we do business these laws and regulations affect the type and manner in which we do business and may limit our ability to expand our product offerings pursue acquisitions or restrict the scope of operations and services provided 

recent market and economic conditions have led to new legislation and numerous proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry including significant additional legislation and regulation in the united states in response to such market and economic conditions the united states government particularly the us department of the treasury the board of governors of the federal reserve system the fdic and foreign governments 

have taken a variety of extraordinary measures designed to restore confidence in the financial markets increase liquidity and to strengthen financial institutions for example on october 3 2008 and on february 17 2009 the eesa and the arra respectively were signed into law these laws are intended to provide fiscal stimulus and stability to the us economy by among other things permitting the us treasury to make direct investments in financial institutions pursuant to the capital purchase program there can be no assurance however as to the actual impact that these laws and their implementing regulations or any other governmental program will have on the financial markets the failure of the financial markets to stabilize and a continuation or worsening of current financial market and economic conditions could continue to materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 

participation in current or future government programs adopted in response to recent market events and economic conditions may subject us to restrictions and additional oversight on the manner in which we operate our business we are currently participating in the capital purchase program and under the terms of the program as amended by the arra the consent of the us treasury is required for us to among other things increase our common stock dividend from the amount of the last quarterly stock dividend declared by us prior to october 14 2008 or except in limited circumstances repurchase our common stock or other preferred stock unless the series k preferred stock that was issued to the us treasury under the capital purchase program has been redeemed or the us treasury has transferred all of the series k preferred stock to a third party the arra also imposes restrictions on our ability to pay incentive compensation to certain of our employees there can be no assurance that any additional restrictions imposed by reason of our participation in the capital purchase program or other government programs will not have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new legislation and regulatory changes could cause business disruptions result in significant loss of revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impact the value of assets that we hold require us to change certain of our business practices impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business for example on december 18 2008 the board of governors of the federal reserve system adopted enhanced regulations for credit cards through amendments to regulation z which implements the truthinlending act and also new regulations governing unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the federal trade commission act these regulatory changes will require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make the necessary disclosure and system changes and could adversely affect our business 

additional legislation and regulations may by enacted or promulgated in the future and we are unable to predict the form such legislation or regulation may take or the degree to which we would need to modify our businesses or operations to comply with such legislation or regulation for example proposed legislation has been introduced in congress that would amend to the bankruptcy code to permit modifications of certain mortgages that are secured by a chapter 13 debtor’s principal residence proposed legislation has also been introduced in congress that would among other things prescribe when interest can be charged on revolving credit card accounts prescribe when and how interest rates can be increased limit events of default that can result in interest rate increases on existing balances restrict the imposition of certain fees require a specified cutoff hour when payments must be credited to accounts prescribe how payments must be allocated to outstanding balances on accounts and restrict the issuance of credit cards for persons under 21 years of age except in certain circumstances there can be no assurance that if any such legislation were enacted that it would not have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we do not comply with the legislation and regulations that apply to our operations we may be subject to fines penalties or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred in recent years regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations if this regulatory trend continues it could adversely affect our operations and in turn our financial results in addition adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers or to maintain access to capital markets which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we face significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us we are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to us which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operation or cause us serious reputational harm as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely we will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations related to our businesses and operations 

there is increasing competition in the financial services industry which may adversely affect our results of operations we operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices consolidations in the financial services industry increased substantially during 2008 as several major us financial institutions merged were forced to sell assets and in some cases failed 

we also face an increasing array of competitors competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks hedge funds insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of our products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for our products and services or may cause us to lose market share increased competition also may require us to make additional capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive these investments may increase expense or may require us to extend more of our capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions there can be no assurance that the significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations 

our acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated we have in the past and may in the future seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses there can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results including results relating to the total cost of integration the time required to complete the integration the amount of longerterm cost savings the overall performance of the combined entity or an improved price for our common stock integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls as well as managing relevant relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners integration efforts could divert management attention and resources which could adversely affect our operations or results 

given the continued market volatility and uncertainty we may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take additional markdowns and allowances for loan losses on the assets and loans acquired in the merger the “bear stearns merger” by and among jpmorgan chase and the bear stearns companies inc “bear stearns” and in connection with the acquisition of washington mutual bank’s “washington mutual” banking operations the “washington mutual transaction” that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future there is no assurance that as our integration efforts continue in connection with these transactions other unanticipated costs or losses will not be incurred 

acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions it is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees the loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business 

damage to our reputation could damage our businesses maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers investors and employees damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures unethical behavior and the activities of customers and counterparties further negative publicity regarding us whether or not true may also result in harm to our prospects 

we could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance our employees are our most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense the executive compensation restrictions currently or that may in the future may be imposed on us as a result of our participation in the capital purchase program or other government programs may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees if we are unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees our performance including our competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if wrong could cause unexpected losses in the future pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements including in determining credit loss reserves reserves related to litigations and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities among other items if assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect we may experience material losses 

for example we make judgments in connection with our consolidation analysis of spes if it is later determined that nonconsolidated spes should be consolidated this could negatively affect our consolidated balance sheets related funding requirements capital ratios and if the spes’ assets include unrealized losses could require us to recognize those losses

certain of our financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities availableforsale securities certain loans msrs private equity investments structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels making their valuation particularly subjective being based on significant estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings

competition 

jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies hedge funds trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies jpmorgan chase’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services transaction execution innovation and price competition also varies based on the types of clients customers industries and geographies served with respect to some of its geographies and products jpmorgan chase competes globally with respect to others the firm competes on a regional basis the firm’s ability to compete also depends upon its 

ability to attract and retain its professional and other personnel and on its reputation 

the financial services industry has experienced consolidation and convergence in recent years as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial products and services have merged this convergence trend is expected to continue consolidation could result in competitors of jpmorgan chase gaining greater capital and other resources such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity it is likely that competition will become even more intense as the firm’s businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that are or may become larger or better capitalized or that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies 

supervision and regulation 

permissible business activities the firm is subject to regulation under state and federal law including the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended jpmorgan chase elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act “glba” 

under regulations implemented by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve board may impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies in addition the federal reserve board may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies persist the regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve board must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies at december 31 2007 the depositoryinstitution subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the firm to conduct the broader activities permitted under glba however there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 

regulation by federal reserve board under glba under glba’s system of “functional regulation” the federal reserve board acts as an “umbrella regulator” and certain of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based upon the particular activities of those subsidiaries jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” see “other supervision and regulation” below for a further description of the regulatory supervision to which the firm’s subsidiaries are subject

dividend restrictions federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase that are national banks nonbank subsidiaries of the firm are not subject to those limitations the amount of dividends that may be paid by national banks such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided profits” see note 27 on pages 165–166 for the amount of dividends that the firm’s principal bank subsidiaries could pay at january 1 2008 and 2007 to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators 

in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the occ the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including jpmorgan chase and its bank and bank holding company subsidiaries if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization 

capital requirements federal banking regulators have adopted riskbased capital and leverage guidelines that require the firm’s capitaltoassets ratios to meet certain minimum standards 

the riskbased capital ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off–balance sheet financial instruments into four weighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk under the guidelines capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital under the guidelines banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio total capital to riskweighted assets of 8 and a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 

the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets which reflects adjustments for disallowed goodwill and certain intangible assets the minimum leverage ratio is 3 for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under federal reserve board guidelines or which have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile and growth plans effective january 1 2008 the sec authorized jpmorgan securities to use the alternative method of computing net capital for brokerdealers that are part of consolidated supervised entities as defined by sec rules accordingly jpmorgan securities may calculate deductions for market risk using its internal market risk models for additional information regarding the firm’s regulatory capital see regulatory capital on page 64 and note 28 on pages 166–167 

the minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee has proposed a revision to the accord “basel ii” us banking regulators are in the process of incorporating the basel ii framework into the existing riskbased capital requirements the basel ii rules will also apply to the firm’s operations in nonus jurisdic 

tions in the us jpmorgan chase will be required to implement advanced measurement techniques by employing internal estimates of certain key risk drivers to derive capital requirements prior to its implementation of the new basel ii framework jpmorgan chase will be required to demonstrate to its us bank supervisors that its internal criteria meet the relevant supervisory standards jpmorgan chase expects to be in compliance with all relevant basel ii rules within the established timelines 

fdicia the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by their federal banking regulators among other things it requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as jpmorgan chase however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to glba the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based upon the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee 

fdic insurance assessments in november 2006 the fdic issued final regulations as required by the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 by which the fdic established a new base rate schedule for the assessment of deposit insurance premiums and set new assessment rates which became effective in january 2007 under these regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based upon capital and supervisory measures depending upon the risk category to which it is assigned the depository institution is then assessed insurance premiums based upon its deposits some depository institutions are entitled to apply against these premiums a credit that is designed to give effect to premium payments if any that the depository institution may have made in certain prior years the new assessment schedule will not have a material adverse effect on the firm’s earnings or financial condition 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured depository institution an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with such institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution 

if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power 1 to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors 2 to enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or 3 to

repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution the above provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na including without limitation obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued by those banks to investors referred to below as “public noteholders” in the public markets 

under federal law the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including public noteholders and depositors in nonus offices in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of the institution as a result whether or not the fdic would ever seek to repudiate any obligations held by public noteholders or depositors in nonus offices of any subsidiary of the firm that is an insured depository institution such as jpmorgan chase bank na or chase bank usa na such persons would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in us offices of the depository institution 

the bank secrecy act the bank secrecy act which was amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 requires all “financial institutions” to establish certain antimoney laundering compliance and due diligence programs the act also requires financial institutions that maintain correspondent accounts for nonus institutions or persons that are involved in private banking for “nonunited states persons” or their representatives to establish “appropriate specific and where necessary enhanced due diligence policies procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering through those accounts” the firm has developed and maintains policies and procedures which are designed to comply with these requirements 

other supervision and regulation under current federal reserve board policy jpmorgan chase is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support its bank subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy however because glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators glba prohibits the federal reserve board from requiring payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to such payment in such a case the federal reserve board could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture 

the bank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to and certain other transactions with the firm and certain other affiliates and on investments in stock or securities of jpmorgan chase and those affiliates these restrictions prevent jpmorgan chase and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary unless the loans are secured in specified amounts see note 27 on pages 165–166 

the firm’s banks and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to direct supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities some of which are considered “functional regulators” 

under glba jpmorgan chase’s national bank subsidiaries such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are subject to supervision and regulation by the occ and in certain matters by the federal reserve board and the fdic supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of the relevant bank’s business and condition as well as the imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and other powers the firm also conducts securities underwriting dealing and brokerage activities through jpmorgan securities and other brokerdealer subsidiaries all of which are subject to the regulations of the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority and other selfregulatory organizations jpmorgan securities is a member of the new york stock exchange the operations of jpmorgan chase mutual funds also are subject to regulation by the sec the firm has subsidiaries that are members of futures exchanges in the us and abroad one subsidiary is registered as a futures commission merchant and other subsidiaries are registered as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors all with the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” these cftcregistered subsidiaries are also members of the national futures association the firm’s energy business is subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission the types of activities in which the nonus branches of jpmorgan chase bank na and the international subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board those nonus branches and international subsidiaries also are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate 

the activities of jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various us federal laws including the truthinlending equal credit opportunity fair credit reporting fair debt collection practice and electronic funds transfer acts as well as various state laws these statutes impose requirements on the making enforcement and collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosures that need to be made in connection with such loans 

under the requirements imposed by glba jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are required periodically to disclose to their retail customers the firm’s policies and practices with respect to 1 the sharing of nonpublic customer information with jpmorgan chase affiliates and others and 2 the confidentiality and security of that information under glba retail customers also must be given the opportunity to “opt out” of informationsharing arrangements with nonaffiliates subject to certain exceptions set forth in glba

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect the firm’s financial condition and operations other factors that could affect the firm’s business and operations are discussed in the “forwardlooking statements” section on page 101 however factors besides those discussed below in the mda or elsewhere in this or other of the firm’s reports filed or furnished with the sec also could adversely affect the firm the reader should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations could be adversely affected by us and international markets and economic conditions 

us and global financial markets and economic conditions have a significant impact on the firm’s businesses factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of debt and equity prices interest rates and commodities prices investor sentiment inflation the availability and cost of capital and credit and the degree to which us or international economies are expanding or experiencing recessionary pressures can affect significantly the activity level of clients with respect to size number and timing of transactions involving the firm’s investment and commercial banking businesses including its underwriting and advisory businesses these factors also can affect the realization of cash returns from the firm’s private equity business a market downturn can lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its customers and therefore lead to a decline in the revenue the firm receives from trading commissions and spreads lower market volatility reduces trading and arbitrage opportunities which could lead to lower trading revenue higher interest rates widening credit spreads or less liquidity or other weakness in the markets also could adversely affect the number or size of underwritings the firm manages on behalf of clients and affect the willingness of financial sponsors or investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by jpmorgan chase 

the firm generally maintains large trading portfolios in the fixed income currency commodity and equity markets and has significant investment positions including merchant banking investments held by its private equity business the revenue derived from marktomarket values of the firm’s businesses are affected by many factors including its credit standing its success in proprietary positioning volatility in interest rates and equity debt and commodities markets credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets and other economic and business factors jpmorgan chase anticipates that revenue relating to its trading will continue to experience volatility and there can be no assurance that such volatility relating to the above factors or other conditions could not materially adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the fees jpmorgan chase earns for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets managed by or held in custody of the firm which in turn could affect the firm’s revenue moreover even in the absence of a market downturn belowmarket or subpar performance by jpmorgan chase’s investment management businesses could result in outflows 

of assets under management and supervision and therefore reduce the fees the firm receives 

the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s on– and off–balance sheet assets may also be affected by economic conditions in a poor economic environment there is a greater likelihood that more of the firm’s customers or counterparties could become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to jpmorgan chase which in turn could result in a higher level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses or requirements that the firm purchase assets or provide other funding any of which could adversely affect the firm’s financial condition 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions such conditions include us interest rates the rate of unemployment housing prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others certain changes to these conditions can diminish demand for the consumer businesses’ products and services or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition adverse economic conditions such as declines in home prices could lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

sudden illiquidity in markets or other abrupt changes in markets or economic indicators can adversely affect any or all of the firm’s businesses for example sudden declines in liquidity or prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain firm balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in the firm’s earnings 

there is increasing competition in the financial services industry which may adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s results of operations 

jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices 

the firm also faces an increasing array of competitors competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies hedge funds trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading jpmorgan chase’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of its products and services transaction execution innovation reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share increased competition also may require the firm to make additional capital investment in its businesses in order to remain competitive these investments may increase expense or may 

  

require the firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions there can be no assurance that the significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s future results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated 

the firm has in the past and may in the future seek to grow its business by acquiring other businesses there can be no assurance that the firm’s acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results including results relating to the total cost of integration the time required to complete the integration the amount of longerterm cost savings the overall performance of the combined entity or improved price for the firm’s common stock integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls as well as managing relevant relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners 

there is no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s most recent acquisitions or that any businesses acquired in the future will be successfully integrated and will result in all of the positive benefits anticipated if jpmorgan chase is not able to integrate successfully its acquisitions the firm’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase relies on its systems employees and certain counterparties and certain failures could materially adversely affect the firm’s operations 

the firm’s businesses are dependent on its ability to process record and monitor a large number of increasingly complex transactions if any of the firm’s financial accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially adversely affected the firm is similarly dependent on its employees the firm could be materially adversely affected if a firm employee causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firm’s operations or systems third parties with which the firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the firm including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties’ own systems or employees any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of the firm to operate one or more of its businesses potential liability to clients reputational damage and regulatory intervention any of which could materially adversely affect the firm 

if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the possession of the firm were to be mishandled or misused the firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include for example if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of the firm’s systems employees or counterparties or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 

the firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters or other damage to property or physical assets or events arising from local or larger scale politics including terrorist acts such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the firm 

  

in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future in addition there is the risk that the firm’s controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate any such failure could affect the firm’s operations and could materially adversely affect its results of operations by requiring the firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as by exposing the firm to litigation or losses not covered by insurance 

jpmorgan chase’s international operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic political legal and other developments 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and revenue are subject to the risks inherent in maintaining international operations and in investing and trading in securities of companies worldwide these risks include among others risk of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls and changes in legislation relating to nonus ownership further various countries in which the firm operates or invests or in which it may do so in the future have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions including extreme currency fluctuations high inflation or low or negative growth among other negative conditions crime corruption and a lack of an established legal framework are additional challenges in some of these countries particularly in the emerging markets revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile than larger markets also any of the abovementioned events or circumstances in one country can and has in the past affected firm operations and investments in another country or countries 

the emergence of a widespread health emergency or pandemic also could create economic or financial disruption that could negatively affect the firm’s revenue and operations or impair its ability to manage its businesses in certain parts of the world 

thus there can be no assurance the firm will not suffer losses in the future arising from unfavorable economic political legal or other international events 

damage to the firm’s reputation could damage the firm’s businesses 

maintaining a positive reputation for the firm is critical to the firm attracting and maintaining customers investors and employees damage to its reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the firm’s business and prospects harm to the firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures unethical behavior and the activities of customers and counterparties further negative publicity regarding the firm whether or not true may also result in harm to the firm’s prospects 

the firm could suffer significant reputational harm if the firm acts when it has or is thought to have conflicts of interest for example if the firm does not properly manage among its various businesses 

  

 part i 

 

 

 

and roles the flow of material nonpublic information of its clients it could suffer reputational harm that could negatively affect its business and profitability management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the firm expands its activities among its numerous transactions obligations holdings and clients therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to the firm 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and its business and results are significantly affected by the regulations to which it is subject 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated environment the regulations to which the firm is subject will continue to have a significant impact on the firm’s operations and the degree to which it can grow and be profitable 

certain regulators which supervise the firm have significant power in reviewing the firm’s operations and approving its business practices these powers include the ability to place limitations or conditions on activities in which the firm engages or intends to engage particularly in recent years the firm’s businesses have experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny often requiring additional firm resources in addition as the firm expands its international operations its activities will become subject to an increasing range of nonus laws and regulations that impose new requirements and limitations on the firm’s operations further there is no assurance that any change to the current regulatory requirements to which jpmorgan chase is subject or the way in which such regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced will not have a negative effect on the firm’s ability to conduct its business or its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm 

jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies actions brought against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm which could materially adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operation or cause it serious reputational harm particularly as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely the firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory investigations related to its businesses and operations 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect its performance 

the firm’s employees are its most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense if jpmorgan chase is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees its performance including its competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

government monetary policies and economic controls may have a significant adverse effect on jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations 

the firm’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states nonus governments and international agencies 

  

for example policies and regulations of the federal reserve board influence directly and indirectly the rate of interest paid by commercial banks on their interestbearing deposits and also may affect the value of financial instruments held by the firm the actions of the federal reserve board also determine to a significant degree the firm’s cost of funds for lending and investing in addition these policies and conditions can adversely affect the firm’s current and potential customers and counterparties both in the united states and abroad which may increase the risk that such customers or counterparties default on their obligations to jpmorgan chase or have diminished demand for the firm’s products and services 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing its risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the firm 

the firm’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the firm types of risk to which the firm is subject include liquidity risk credit risk market risk interest rate risk operational risk legal and fiduciary risk reputational risk and private equity risk among others however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to the firm’s risk management strategies as there may exist or develop in the future risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified if the firm’s risk management framework proves ineffective the firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

many of the firm’s hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historic market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment for example many models used by the firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements in the past sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the firm’s risk management strategies causing the firm to incur losses this may occur again in the future in addition as the firm’s businesses grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve the firm’s risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes for example there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified monitored or managed there can be no assurance that the firm’s risk management framework including its underlying assumptions or strategies will at all times be accurate and effective 

 

finally the firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because in a difficult or less liquid market environment other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the difficult market conditions in such circumstances it may be difficult for the firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could be negatively affected 

the firm’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses grow and be profitable a compromise to the firm’s liquidity can have a significant negative effect on the firm some potential conditions that could negatively affect the firm’s liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets diminished access to capital markets unforeseen 

  

cash or capital requirements including among others commitments to special purpose entities “spes” or other entities that may be triggered and difficulty or inability to sell assets these conditions may be caused by events over which the firm has little or no control including for example sudden or unanticipated contraction of the credit or other market or economic downturns further in a period of difficult credit or other markets the firm may be forced to fund its operations at a higher cost or it may be unable to raise as much funding as it needs to support its business activities this could cause the firm to curtail its business activities while incurring higher costs for funding 

the credit ratings of the firm and jpmorgan chase bank na are important in order to maintain the firm’s liquidity a reduction in the firm’s credit ratings depending on the severity could potentially increase borrowing costs limit access to capital markets require cash payments or collateral posting and permit termination of certain contracts to which the firm is a party reduction in the ratings of certain spes or other entities to which the firm has a funding or other commitment could also negatively affect the firm’s liquidity where such ratings changes lead directly or indirectly to the firm being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding 

as a holding company jpmorgan chase relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and consequent ability to pay dividends and satisfy its obligations these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends loans or other payments several of the firm’s principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments limitations in the payments the firm receives from its subsidiaries could negatively affect the firm’s liquidity position 

the firm could be negatively affected in a situation in which other financial institutions are negatively impacted 

the firm could be affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions financial services institutions that deal with each other are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships while the firm has exposure to many different industries and counterparties it routinely executes a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall as a result a default by or even concerns about one or more financial services institutions could lead to significant marketwide liquidity problems or losses or defaults by other institutions including the firm 

derivative and other transactions may expose the firm to unexpected risk and potential losses 

the firm is party to numerous derivative and other transactions including transactions that require the physical settlement or delivery of securities commodities or other obligations the firm does not own if the firm is not able to obtain those securities commodities or other obligations within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays which could damage the firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business 

  

derivative and other transactions entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by counterparties on a timely basis while a transaction remains unconfirmed the firm is subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default the firm may find the contract more difficult to enforce in addition as new and more complex derivative products are created disputes regarding the terms of the underlying contracts could arise which could force the firm to incur unexpected costs and impair its ability to manage effectively its risk exposures from these products 

the firm’s commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose it to significant cost and liability 

in connection with the commodities activities of the firm’s investment bank the firm engages in the storage transportation marketing or trading of several commodities including metals agricultural products crude oil oil products natural gas electric power emission credits coal freight and related products and indices as a result of these activities the firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy commodities environmental and other governmental laws and regulations the firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities business to expand in scope and complexity the firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties the firm’s commodities business also further exposes it to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events including natural disasters leaks spills explosions release of toxic substances fires accidents on land and at sea wars and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries loss of life property damage and suspension of operations the firm attempts to mitigate its risks but its actions may not prove adequate to address every contingency in addition insurance covering some of these risks may not be available and the proceeds if any from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents as a result the firm’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events 

the firm’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if wrong could cause unexpected losses in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” the firm is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements including in determining credit loss reserves reserves related to litigations and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities among other items if assumptions or estimates underlying the firm’s financial statements are incorrect the firm may experience material losses 

for example the firm makes judgments in connection with its consolidation analysis of its spes if it is later determined that nonconsolidated spes should be consolidated this could negatively affect the firm’s consolidated balance sheet related funding requirements capital ratios and if the spes’ assets include unrealized losses could require the firm to recognize those losses 

  

part i 

  

certain of the firm’s financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities availableforsale “afs” securities certain loans mortgage servicing rights “msrs” private equity investments structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the firm’s financial statements where quoted market prices are not available the firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment some of these and other firm assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels making their valuation particularly subjective being based on significant estimation and judgment

competition 

jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies hedge funds trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies jpmorgan chase’s businesses compete with these other firms with respect to the quality and range of products and services offered and the types of clients customers industries and geogra 

phies served with respect to some of its geographies and products jpmorgan chase competes globally with respect to others the firm competes on a regional basis jpmorgan chase’s ability to compete effectively depends upon the relative performance of its products the degree to which the features of its products appeal to customers and the extent to which the firm is able to meet its clients’ objectives or needs the firm’s ability to compete also depends upon its ability to attract and retain its professional and other personnel and on its reputation 

the financial services industry has experienced consolidation and convergence in recent years as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial products and services have merged this convergence trend is expected to continue consolidation could result in competitors of jpmorgan chase gaining greater capital and other resources such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity it is possible that competition will become even more intense as the firm continues to compete with other financial institutions that may be larger or better capitalized or that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies for a discussion of certain risks relating to the firm’s competitive environment see the risk factors on page 4 

supervision and regulation 

permissible business activities the firm is subject to regulation under state and federal law including the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the “bhca” jpmorgan chase elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act “glba” 

under regulations implemented by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve board may impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies in addition the federal reserve board may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies persist the regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve board must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies at december 31 2006 the depositoryinstitution subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the firm to conduct the broader activities permitted under glba however there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 

regulation by federal reserve board under glba under glba’s system of “functional regulation” the federal reserve board acts as an “umbrella regulator” and certain of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based upon the particular activities of those subsidiaries jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” see “other supervision and regulation” below for a further description of the regulatory supervision to which the firm’s subsidiaries are subject 

  part i 

dividend restrictions federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase that are national banks nonbank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase are not subject to those limitations the amount of dividends that may be paid by national banks such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided profits” see note 25 on page 129 for the amount of dividends that the firm’s principal bank subsidiaries could pay at january 1 2007 and 2006 to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators 

in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the occ the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including jpmorgan chase and its bank and bank holding company subsidiaries if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization 

capital requirements federal banking regulators have adopted riskbased capital and leverage guidelines that require the firm’s capitaltoassets ratios to meet certain minimum standards 

the riskbased capital ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into four weighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk under the guidelines capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital under the guidelines banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio total capital to riskweighted assets of 8 and a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 

the federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by average total assets net of the allowance for loan losses goodwill and certain intangible assets the minimum leverage ratio is 3 for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under federal reserve board guidelines or which have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile and growth plans see regulatory capital on page 58 and note 26 on page 129 

the riskbased capital requirements explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk certain risks arising from nontraditional banking activities and the management of those risks as important factors to consider in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy other factors taken into consideration by federal regulators include interest rate exposure liquidity funding and market risk the quality and level of earnings the quality of loans and investments the effectiveness of loan and investment policies and management’s overall ability to monitor and control financial and operational risks including the risks presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional banking activities in addition the riskbased capital rules incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments the market riskbased capital 

rules require banking organizations with large trading activities such as jpmorgan chase to maintain capital for market risk in an amount calculated by using the banking organizations’ own internal valueatrisk models subject to parameters set by the regulators 

the minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee has proposed a revision to the accord “basel ii” us banking regulators are in the process of incorporating the basel ii framework into the existing riskbased capital requirements jpmorgan chase will be required to implement advanced measurement techniques in the us commencing in 2009 by employing internal estimates of certain key risk drivers to derive capital requirements prior to its implementation of the new basel ii framework jpmorgan chase will be required to demonstrate to its us bank supervisors that its internal criteria meet the relevant supervisory standards jpmorgan chase expects to be in compliance within the established timelines with all relevant basel ii rules during 2007 and 2008 the firm will adopt basel ii rules in certain nonus jurisdictions as required 

fdicia the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by their federal banking regulators among other things it requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards 

supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as jpmorgan chase however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to glba the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based upon the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee 

fdic insurance assessments in november 2006 the fdic issued final regulations as required by the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 by which the fdic established a new base rate schedule for the assessment of deposit insurance premiums and set new assessment rates which became effective in january 2007 under these regulations each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based upon capital and supervisory measures depending upon the risk category to which it is assigned the depository institution is then assessed insurance premiums based upon its deposits some depository institutions are entitled to apply against these premiums a credit that is designed to give effect to premium payments if any that the depository institution may have made in certain prior years the new assessment schedule will not have a material adverse effect on the firm’s earnings or financial condition 

  powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured depository institution an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with such institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution 

if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power 1 to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors 2 to enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or 3 to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution the above provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na including without limitation obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued by those banks to investors referenced below as “public noteholders” in the public markets 

under federal law the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including public noteholders and depositors in nonus offices in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of the institution as a result whether or not the fdic would ever seek to repudiate any obligations held by public noteholders or depositors in nonus offices of any subsidiary of the firm that is an insured depository institution such as jpmorgan chase bank na or chase bank usa na such persons would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors of the depository institution 

the bank secrecy act the bank secrecy act which was amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 requires all “financial institutions” to establish certain antimoney laundering compliance and due diligence programs the act also requires financial institutions that maintain correspondent accounts for nonus institutions or persons that are involved in private banking for “nonunited states persons” or their representatives to establish “appropriate specific and where necessary enhanced due diligence policies procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering through those accounts” 

other supervision and regulation under current federal reserve board policy jpmorgan chase is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support its bank subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy however because glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators glba prohibits the federal reserve board from requiring payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to such payment 

in such a case the federal reserve board could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture 

any loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary banks in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank at a certain level would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

the bank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to and certain other transactions with the firm and certain other affiliates and on investments in stock or securities of jpmorgan chase and those affiliates these restrictions prevent jpmorgan chase and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary unless the loans are secured in specified amounts see note 25 on page 129 

the firm’s banks and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to direct supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities some of which are considered “functional regulators” under glba jpmorgan chase’s national bank subsidiaries such as jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na are subject to supervision and regulation by the occ and in certain matters by the federal reserve board and the fdic supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of the relevant bank’s business and condition as well as the imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and other powers the firm also conducts securities underwriting dealing and brokerage activities through jpmorgan securities and other brokerdealer subsidiaries all of which are subject to the regulations of the sec and the nasd regulation inc “nasd” and other selfregulatory organizations “sros” jpmorgan securities is a member of the new york stock exchange “nyse” the operations of jpmorgan chase’s mutual funds also are subject to regulation by the sec the firm has subsidiaries that are members of futures exchanges in the us and abroad one subsidiary is registered as a futures commission merchant and other subsidiaries are registered as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors all with the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” these cftcregistered subsidiaries are also members of the national futures association the firm’s energy business is also subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission the types of activities in which the nonus branches of jpmorgan chase bank na and the international subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board those nonus branches and international subsidiaries also are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate 

the activities of jpmorgan chase bank na and chase bank usa na as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various us federal laws including the truthinlending equal credit opportunity fair credit reporting fair debt collection practice and electronic funds transfer acts as well as various state laws these statutes impose requirements on the making enforcement and collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosures that need to be made in connection with such loans 

  part i 

in addition under the requirements imposed by glba jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are required periodically to disclose to their retail customers the firm’s policies and practices with respect to 1 the sharing of nonpublic customer information with jpmorgan chase affiliates and others and 2 the confidentiality and security of that information under glba retail customers also must be given the opportunity to “opt out” of informationsharing arrangements with nonaffiliates subject to certain exceptions set forth in glba 

for a discussion of certain risks relating to the firm’s regulatory environment see risk factors below 

nonus operations 

for geographic distributions of total revenue total expense income before income tax expense and net income see note 32 on page 138 for information regarding nonus loans see note 12 on page 112 and the sections entitled “emerging markets country exposure” in the mda on page 72 loan portfolio on page 154 and “crossborder outstandings” on page 155




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could affect the firm’s business and operations other factors that could affect the firm’s business and operations are discussed in the “forward looking statements” section on page 147 however factors besides those discussed below in the mda or elsewhere in this or other of the firm’s reports filed or furnished with the sec also could adversely affect the firm’s business or results the reader should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that may face the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations could be adversely affected by us and international markets and economic conditions the firm’s businesses are affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally both in the us and internationally factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of equity prices interest rates and commodities prices investor sentiment inflation and the availability and cost of credit can affect significantly the activity level of clients with respect to size number and timing of transactions involving the firm’s investment banking business including its underwriting and advisory businesses these factors also may affect the realization of cash returns from the firm’s private equity business a market downturn would likely lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its customers and therefore lead to a decline in the revenues it receives from trading commissions and spreads in addition lower market volatility will reduce trading and arbitrage opportunities which could lead to lower trading revenues higher interest rates or weakness in the markets also could adversely affect the number or size of underwritings the firm manages on behalf of clients and affect the willingness of financial sponsors or investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by jpmorgan chase 

the firm generally maintains large trading portfolios in the fixed income currency commodity and equity markets and has significant investment positions including merchant banking investments held by its private equity business the revenues derived from marktomarket values of the firm’s business are affected by many factors including its credit standing its success in proprietary positioning volatility in interest rates and equity and debt markets and other economic and business factors jpmorgan chase anticipates that revenues relating to its trading will experience volatility and there can be no assurance that such volatility relating to the above factors or other conditions could not materially adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the fees jpmorgan chase earns for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets managed by the firm which in turn could affect the firm’s revenues moreover even in the absence of a market downturn belowmarket or subpar performance by jpmorgan chase’s investment management businesses could result in outflows of assets under management and supervision and therefore reduce the fees the firm receives 

the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet assets may be affected by business conditions in a poor economic environment there is a greater likelihood that more of the firm’s customers or counterparties could become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to jpmorgan chase which in turn could result in a higher level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses all of which would adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions that can materially adversely affect such businesses and the firm such conditions include us interest rates the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others certain changes to these conditions can diminish demand for businesses’ products and services or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition a deterioration in consumers’ credit quality could lead to an increase in loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which could adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

there is increasing competition in the financial services industry which may adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s results of operations jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices 

the firm also faces an increasing array of competitors competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies hedge funds trust companies securities processing companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading jpmorgan chase’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of its products and services transaction execution innovation technology reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share increased competition also may require the firm to make additional capital investment in its businesses in order to remain competitive these investments may increase expenses or may require the firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions there can be no assurance that the significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s future results of operations

jpmorgan chase’s acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated the firm has in the past and may in the future seek to grow its business by acquiring other businesses there can be no assurance that the firm’s acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results including results relating to the total cost of integration the time required to complete the integration the amount of longerterm cost savings or the overall performance of the combined entity integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls as well as managing relevant relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners 

there is no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s most recent acquisitions or that any businesses acquired in the future will be successfully integrated and will result in all of the positive benefits anticipated if jpmorgan chase is not able to integrate successfully its past and any future acquisitions there is the risk the firm’s results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase relies on its systems employees and certain counterparties and certain failures could materially adversely affect the firm’s operations the firm’s businesses are dependent on its ability to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions if any of the firm’s financial accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially adversely affected the firm is similarly dependent on its employees the firm could be materially adversely affected if a firm employee causes a significant operational break down or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firm’s operations or systems third parties with which the firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the firm including relating to break downs or failures of such parties’ own systems or employees any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of the firm to operate one or more of its businesses potential liability to clients reputational damage and regulatory intervention which could materially adversely affect the firm 

the firm also may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters such as hurricane katrina or events arising from local or regional politics including terrorist acts such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the firm 

in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future 

in addition there is the risk that the firm’s controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate any such failure could affect the firm’s operations and could materially adversely affect its results of operations by requiring the firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as by exposing the firm to litigation or losses not covered by insurance 

jpmorgan chase’s nonus trading activities and operations are subject to risk of loss particularly in emerging markets the firm does business throughout the world including in developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets in the past many emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions 

including devaluations of their currencies and capital and currency exchange controls as well as low or negative economic growth 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from various unfavorable political economic and legal developments including currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to nonus ownership 

the firm also invests in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions including emerging markets revenues from the trading of nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as nonus trading markets particularly in emerging markets are usually smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets there can be no assurance the firm will not suffer losses in the future arising from its nonus trading activities or operations 

if jpmorgan chase does not successfully handle issues that may arise in the conduct of its business and operations its reputation could be damaged which could in turn negatively affect its business the firm’s ability to attract and retain customers and transact with its counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged the failure of the firm to deal or to appear to fail to deal with various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to the firm and its business prospects these issues include but are not limited to appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues moneylaundering privacy recordkeeping sales and trading practices and the proper identification of the legal reputational credit liquidity and market risks inherent in its products the failure to address appropriately these issues could make the firm’s clients unwilling to do business with the firm which could adversely affect the firm’s results 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and its business and results are significantly affected by the regulations to which it is subject jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated environment the regulations to which the firm is subject will continue to have a significant impact on the firm’s operations and the degree to which it can grow and be profitable 

certain regulators to which the firm is subject have significant power in reviewing the firm’s operations and approving its business practices particularly in recent years the firm’s businesses have experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny often requiring additional firm resources in addition as the firm expands its international operations its activities will become subject to an increasing range of nonus laws and regulations that likely will impose new requirements and limitations on certain of the firm’s operations there is no assurance that any change to the current regulatory requirements to which jpmorgan chase is subject or the way in which such regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced will not have a negative effect on the firm’s ability to conduct its business or its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies these or other future actions brought against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm 

  part i 

which could materially adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operation or cause it serious reputational harm 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect its performance the firm’s employees are its most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense if jpmorgan chase is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees its performance including its competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

government monetary policies and economic controls may have a significant adverse affect on jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations the firm’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states nonus governments and international agencies for example policies and regulations of the federal reserve board influence directly and indirectly the rate of interest paid by commercial banks on their interestbearing deposits and also may affect the value of financial instruments held by the firm the actions of the federal reserve board also determine to a significant degree the firm’s cost of funds for lending and investing in addition these policies and conditions can adversely affect the firm’s customers and counterparties both in the united states and abroad which may increase the risk that such customers or counterparties default on their obligations to jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing its risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the firm jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage the firm’s risk exposure types of risk to which the firm is subject include liquidity risk credit risk market risk interest rate risk operational risk legal and reputational risk fiduciary risk and private equity risk among others there can be no assurance that the firm’s framework to manage risk including such framework’s underlying assumptions will be effective under all conditions and circumstances 

as the firm’s businesses grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve the firm’s risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes for example as the derivatives markets continue to grow and the firm’s participation in these markets expands there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products may not be appropriately identified monitored or managed or that the documentation of these trades by the firm or its counterparties will not keep up with the increased pace of settlements in addition in the case of credit derivatives that require physical settlement of transactions many market participants including the firm do not always hold the underlying securities or loans relating to such derivatives if the firm is not able to obtain those securities or loans within the required timeframe for delivery this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it 

if the firm’s risk management framework proves ineffective whether because it does not keep pace with changing firm or market circumstances or otherwise the firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could be negatively affected the firm’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses grow and be profitable a compromise to the firm’s liquidity could therefore have a negative effect on the firm potential conditions that could negatively affect the firm’s liquidity include diminished access to capital markets unforeseen cash or capital requirements and an inability to sell assets 

the firm’s credit ratings are an important part of maintaining its liquidity and a reduction in the firm’s credit ratings would also negatively affect the firm’s liquidity a credit ratings downgrade depending on its severity could potentially increase borrowing costs limit access to capital markets require cash payments or collateral posting and permit termination of certain contracts to which the firm is a party 

future events may be different than those anticipated by jpmorgan chase’s management assumptions and estimates which may cause unexpected losses in the future pursuant to us gaap the firm is required to use certain estimates in preparing its financial statements including accounting estimates to determine loan loss reserves reserves related to future litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities among other items should the firm’s determined values for such items prove substantially inaccurate the firm may experience unexpected losses that could be material

in addition to the various cases proceedings and investigations discussed above jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or otherwise involved in a number of other legal actions and governmental proceedings arising in connection with their businesses additional actions investigations or proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the cases present novel legal theories involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery the firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss fines penalties or impact related to each pending matter may be jpmorgan chase believes based upon its current knowledge after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves that the outcome of the legal actions proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the firm however in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings actions and investigations there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the firm as a result the outcome of a particular matter may be material to jpmorgan chase’s operating results for a particular period depending upon among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of jpmorgan chase’s income for that period

 item 9a controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this report an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the firm’s management including its chairman and chief executive officer and its chief financial officer of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon that evalua

tion the chairman and chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective see exhibits 311 and 312 for the certification statements issued by the chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer 

the firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting nevertheless because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 

in addition in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies – or even material weaknesses – in internal controls in the future see page 88 for management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and page 89 for the report of independent registered public accounting firm with respect to management’s assessment of internal control there was no change in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2006 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the firm’s internal control over financial reporting

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could affect the firm’s business and operations however other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this or other of the firm’s reports filed or furnished with the sec also could adversely affect the firm’s business or results the reader should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that may face the firm 

jpmorgan chase’s results of operations could be adversely affected by us and international markets and economic conditions the firm’s businesses are affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally both in the us and internationally factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of equity prices interest rates and commodities prices investor sentiment inflation and the availability and cost of credit can significantly affect the activity level of clients with respect to size number and timing of transactions involving the firm’s investment banking business including its underwriting and advisory businesses these factors also may affect the realization of cash returns from the firm’s private equity business a market downturn would likely lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its customers and therefore lead to a decline in the revenues it receives from trading commissions and spreads in addition lower market volatility will reduce trading and arbitrage opportunities which could lead to lower trading revenues higher interest rates or weakness in the markets also could adversely affect the number or size of underwritings the firm manages on behalf of clients and affect the willingness of financial sponsors or investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by jpmorgan chase 

the firm generally maintains large trading portfolios in the fixed income currency commodity and equity markets and has significant investment positions including merchant banking investments held by its private equity business the revenues derived from marktomarket values of the firm’s business are affected by many factors including its credit standing its success in proprietary positioning volatility in interest rates and equity and debt markets and other economic and business factors jpmorgan chase anticipates that revenues relating to its trading will experience volatility and there can be no assurance that such volatility relating to the above factors or other conditions could not materially adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the fees jpmorgan chase earns for managing thirdparty assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect the valuations of the thirdparty assets managed by the firm which in turn could affect the firm’s revenues moreover even in the absence of a market downturn belowmarket performance by jpmorgan chase’s investment management businesses could result in outflows of assets under management and supervision and therefore reduce the fees the firm receives 

the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet assets may be affected by business conditions in a poor economic environment there is a greater likelihood that more of the firm’s customers or counterparties could become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to jpmorgan chase which in turn could result in a higher level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses all of which would adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions which can materially adversely affect such businesses and the firm 

  such conditions include us interest rates the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others certain changes to these conditions can diminish demand for businesses’ products and services or increase the cost to provide such products and services in addition a deterioration in consumers’ credit quality could lead to an increase in loan delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which could adversely affect the firm’s earnings 

there is increasing competition in the financial services industry which may adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s results of operations jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger bettercapitalized and more geographicallydiverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices 

the firm also faces an increasing array of competitors competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies hedge funds trust companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic securities trading jpmorgan chase’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of its products and services transaction execution innovation technology reputation and price ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the firm’s products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share increased competition may also require the firm to make additional capital investment in its businesses in order to remain competitive which investments may increase expenses or which may require the firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger more competitive transactions there can be no assurance that the significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s future results of operations 

jpmorgan chase’s acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated the firm has in the past and may in the future seek to grow its business by acquiring other businesses there can be no assurance that the firm’s acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results including results relating to the total cost of integration the time required to complete the integration the amount of longerterm cost savings or the overall performance of the combined entity integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls as well as managing relevant relationships with clients suppliers and other business partners as well as with employees 

there is no assurance that jpmorgan chase’s most recent acquisitions or that any businesses acquired in the future will be successfully integrated and will result in all of the positive benefits anticipated if jpmorgan chase is not able to integrate successfully its past and any future acquisitions there is the risk the firm’s results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

jpmorgan chase relies on its systems employees and certain counterparties and certain failures could materially adversely affect the firm’s operations the firm’s businesses are dependent on its ability to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions if any of the firm’s financial accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings the firm could be materially adversely affected the firm is similarly dependent on its employees the firm could be materially adversely affected if a firm employee causes a significant operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firm’s operations or systems third parties with which the firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the firm including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties’ own systems or employees any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of the firm to operate one or more of its businesses potential liability to clients reputational damage and regulatory intervention which could materially adversely affect the firm 

the firm may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters such as hurricane katrina or events arising from local or regional politics including terrorist acts such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the firm 

in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting are likely to occur from time to time and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future 

in addition there is the risk that the firm’s controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate any such failure could affect the firm’s operations and could materially adversely affect its results of operations by requiring the firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as by exposing the firm to litigation or losses not covered by insurance 

jpmorgan chase’s nonus trading activities and operations are subject to risk of loss particularly in emerging markets the firm does business throughout the world including in developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets in the past many emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions including devaluations of their currencies and capital and currency exchange controls as well as low or negative economic growth 

jpmorgan chase’s businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from various unfavorable political economic and legal developments including currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to nonus ownership 

the firm also invests in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions including emerging markets revenues from the trading of nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as nonus trading markets particularly in emerging markets are usually smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets there can be no assurance the firm will not suffer losses in the future arising from its nonus trading activities or operations 

  part i 

if jpmorgan chase does not successfully handle issues that may arise in the conduct of its business and operations its reputation could be damaged which could in turn negatively affect its business the firm’s ability to attract and retain customers and transact with its counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged the failure of the firm to deal or to appear to fail to deal with various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to the firm and its business prospects these issues include but are not limited to appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues moneylaundering privacy recordkeeping sales and trading practices and the proper identification of the legal reputational credit liquidity and market risks inherent in its products the failure to address appropriately these issues could make the firm’s clients unwilling to do business with the firm which could adversely affect the firm’s results 

jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry and its business and results are significantly affected by the regulations to which it is subject jpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated environment the regulations to which the firm is subject will continue to have a significant impact on the firm’s operations and the degree to which it can grow and be profitable 

certain regulators to which the firm is subject have significant power in reviewing the firm’s operations and approving its business practices particularly in recent years the firm’s businesses have experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny often requiring additional firm resources in addition as the firm expands its international operations its activities will become subject to an increasing range of nonus laws and regulations that will likely impose new requirements and limitations on certain of the firm’s operations there is no assurance that any change to the current regulatory requirements to which jpmorgan chase is subject or the way in which such regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced will not have a negative affect on the firm’s ability to conduct its business and its results of operations 

jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant in various legal actions including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies these or other future actions brought against the firm may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results adverse to the firm which could materially adversely affect the firm’s business financial condition or results of operation or cause it serious reputational harm 

jpmorgan chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect its performance the firm’s employees are its most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense if jpmorgan chase is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees its performance including its competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

government monetary policies and economic controls may have a significant adverse affect on jpmorgan chase’s businesses and results of operations the firm’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states nonus governments and international agencies for example policies and regulations of the federal reserve board influence directly and indirectly the rate of interest paid by commercial banks on their interestbearing deposits and also may affect the value of financial instruments held by the firm the actions of the federal reserve board also determine to a significant degree the firm’s cost of funds for lending and investing in addition these policies and conditions can adversely affect the firm’s customers and counterparties both in the united states and abroad which may increase the risk that such customers or counterparties default on their obligations to jpmorgan chase 

jpmorgan chase’s framework for managing its risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the firm jpmorgan chase’s risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage the firm’s risk exposure types of risk to which the firm is subject include liquidity risk credit risk market risk interest rate risk operational risk legal and reputation risk fiduciary risk and private equity risk among others there can be no assurance that the firm’s framework to manage risk including such framework’s underlying assumptions will be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the firm’s risk management framework proves ineffective the firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 

if jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could be negatively impacted the firm’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses grow and be profitable a compromise to the firm’s liquidity could therefore have a negative effect on the firm potential conditions that could negatively affect the firm’s liquidity include diminished access to capital markets unforeseen cash or capital requirements and an inability to sell assets 

the firm’s credit ratings are an important part of maintaining its liquidity as a reduction in the firm’s credit ratings would also negatively affect the firm’s liquidity a credit ratings downgrade depending on its severity could potentially increase borrowing costs limit access to capital markets require cash payments or collateral posting and permit termination of certain contracts material to the firm 

future events may be different than those anticipated by jpmorgan chase’s management assumptions and estimates which may cause unexpected losses in the future pursuant to us gaap the firm is required to use certain estimates in preparing its financial statements including accounting estimates to determine loan loss reserves reserves related to future litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities among other items should the firm’s determined values for such items prove substantially inaccurate the firm may experience unexpected losses which could be material

  in addition to the various cases proceedings and investigations discussed above jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of other legal actions and governmental proceedings arising in connection with their businesses additional actions investigations or proceedings may be brought from time to time in the future in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the cases present novel legal theories involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery the firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss fines or penalties related to each pending matter may be jpmorgan chase believes based upon its current 

knowledge after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves that the outcome of the legal actions proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the firm however in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings actions and investigations there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the firm as a result the outcome of a particular matter may be material to jpmorgan chase’s operating results for a particular period depending upon among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of jpmorgan chase’s income for that period

 item 9a controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this report an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the firm’s management including its chairman chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon that evaluation the chairman chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective see exhibits 311 312 and 313 for the certification statements issued by the chairman chief executive officer and chief financial officer 

the firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting nevertheless because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase lapses or deficiencies in internal controls are likely to occur from time to time and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies – or even material weaknesses – in internal controls in the future see page 85 for management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and page 86 for the report of independent registered public accounting firm with respect to management’s assessment of internal control there was no change in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the firm’s internal control over financial reporting

item 1 business effective july 1 2004 bank one corporation “bank one” merged with and into jpmorgan chase  co the “merger” pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated january 14 2004 as a result of the merger each outstanding share of common stock of bank one was converted in a stockforstock exchange into 132 shares of common stock of jpmorgan chase  co “jpmorgan chase” or the “firm” the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting the purchase price to complete the merger was 585 billion 

    bank one’s results of operations were included in the firm’s results beginning july 1 2004 therefore the results of operations for the 12 months ended december 31 2004 reflect six months of operations of the combined firm and six months of heritage jpmorgan chase the results of operations for all other periods prior to 2004 reflect only the operations of heritage jpmorgan chase 

overview jpmorgan chase is a financial holding company incorporated under delaware law in 1968 jpmorgan chase is one of the largest banking institutions in the united states with 12 trillion in assets 106 billion in stockholders’ equity and operations in more than 50 countries jpmorgan chase’s principal bank subsidiaries are jpmorgan chase bank national association “jpmorgan chase bank” a national banking association with branches in 17 states and chase bank usa national association “chase usa” a national association that is the firm’s credit cardissuing bank jpmorgan chase’s principal nonbank subsidiary is jp morgan securities inc “jpmsi” its us investment banking firm the bank and nonbank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries representative offices and affiliated banks the firm’s website is wwwjpmorganchasecom jpmorgan chase makes available free of charge through its website annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or section 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with or furnishes such material to the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the firm has adopted and posted on its website a code of ethics for its chief executive officer president and chief operating officer chief financial officer chief accounting officer and other senior financial officers 

business segments jpmorgan chase’s activities are organized for management reporting purposes into six business segments investment bank retail financial services card services commercial banking treasury  securities services and asset  wealth management and corporate which includes its private equity and treasury businesses as well as corporate support functions a description of the firm’s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the “business segment results” section of management’s discussion and analysis “mda” beginning on page 28 and in note 31 on page 126 

competition jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking 

companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies jpmorgan chase’s businesses compete with these other firms with respect to the range of products and services offered and the types of clients customers industries and geographies served with respect to some of its geographies and products jpmorgan chase competes globally with respect to others the firm competes on a regional basis jpmorgan chase’s ability to compete effectively depends on the relative performance of its products the degree to which the features of its products appeal to customers and the extent to which the firm is able to meet its clients’ objectives or needs the firm’s ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain its professional and other personnel and on its reputation the financial services industry has experienced consolidation and convergence in recent years as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial products and services have merged this convergence trend is expected to continue as demonstrated by the merger of jpmorgan chase and bank one corporation on july 1 2004 consolidation could result in competitors of jpmorgan chase gaining greater capital and other resources such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity it is possible that competition will become even more intense as the firm continues to compete with other financial institutions that may be larger or better capitalized or that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies 

supervision and regulation permissible business activities the firm is subject to regulation under state and federal law including the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the “bhca” under the 1999 grammleachbliley act “glba” bank holding companies meeting certain eligibility criteria may elect to become “financial holding companies” which may engage in activities that have been approved by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” and the united states department of the treasury “us treasury department” jpmorgan chase elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 under regulations implemented by the federal reserve board if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards the federal reserve board may impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies in addition the federal reserve board may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies 

part i persist the regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve board must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies at december 31 2004 the depositoryinstitution subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase met the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the firm to conduct the broader activities permitted under glba however there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future regulation by federal reserve board under glba under glba’s system of “functional regulation” the federal reserve board acts as an “umbrella regulator” and certain of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries eg the lead bank is regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” securities and investment advisory activities are regulated by the sec and insurance activities are regulated by state insurance commissioners dividend restrictions federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase that are national banks nonbank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase are not subject to those limitations the amount of dividends that may be paid by national banks such as jpmorgan chase bank and chase usa is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the national bank obtains the approval of the comptroller of the currency under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided profits” see note 23 on page 116 for the amount of dividends that the firm’s principal bank subsidiaries could pay at january 1 2005 and 2004 to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of the relevant banking regulators in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including jpmorgan chase and its bank and bank holding company subsidiaries if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization capital requirements federal banking regulators have adopted riskbased capital and leverage guidelines that require the firm’s capitaltoassets ratios to meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into four weighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk under the guidelines capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital under the guidelines banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio total capital to riskweighted assets of 8 and a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 tier 1 components capital surplus and common stock remain the most important forms of capital at jpmorgan chase because common equity has no maturity date and because dividends on common stock are paid only 

when and if declared by the board of directors common equity is available to absorb losses over long periods of time noncumulative perpetual preferred stock is similar to common stock in its ability to absorb losses if the board of directors does not declare a dividend on noncumulative perpetual preferred stock in any dividend period the holders of the instrument are never entitled to receive that dividend payment jpmorgan chase’s outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock is a type commonly referenced as a “frap” a fixedrate adjustable preferred stock because the interest rate on fraps may increase up to a predetermined ceiling the federal reserve board treats the firm’s noncumulative fraps in a manner similar to cumulative perpetual preferred securities the federal reserve board permits cumulative perpetual preferred securities to be included in tier 1 capital but only up to certain limits as these financial instruments do not provide as strong protection against losses as common equity and noncumulative nonfrap securities cumulative perpetual preferred stock does not have a maturity date similar to other forms of tier 1 capital however any dividends not declared on cumulative perpetual preferred stock accumulate and thus continue to be due to the holder of the instrument until all arrearages are satisfied on march 1 2005 the federal reserve board issued a final rule that continues the inclusion of trust preferred securities in tier 1 capital subject to stricter quantitative limits the rule provides for a fiveyear transition period the firm is currently assessing the impact of the final rule the effective date of the final rule is dependent on the date of publication in the federal register trust preferred securities are generally issued by a specialpurpose trust established and owned by jpmorgan chase proceeds from the issuance to the public of the trust preferred security are lent to the firm for at least 30 but not more than 50 years the intercompany note that evidences this loan provides that the interest payments by jpmorgan chase on the note may be deferred for up to five years during the period of any such deferral no payments of dividends may be made on any outstanding jpmorgan chase preferred or common stock or on the outstanding trust preferred securities issued to the public during 2003 the firm implemented financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46” which addresses the consolidation rules to be applied to entities defined in fin 46 as “variable interest entities” prior to fin 46 trusts that issued trust preferred securities were consolidated subsidiaries of their respective parents as a result of fin 46 jpmorgan chase is no longer permitted to consolidate these trusts tier 2 components longterm subordinated debt generally having an original maturity of 1012 years is the primary form of jpmorgan chase’s tier 2 capital subordinated debt is deemed a form of regulatory capital because payments on the debt are subordinated to other creditors of jpmorgan chase including holders of senior and medium longterm debt and counterparties on derivative contracts the federal banking regulators have also established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by average total assets net of the allowance for loan losses goodwill and certain intangible assets the minimum leverage ratio is 3 for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under federal reserve board guidelines or which have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile and growth plans 

the riskbased capital requirements explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk certain risks arising from nontraditional banking activities and the management of those risks as important factors to consider in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy other factors taken into consideration by federal regulators include interest rate exposure liquidity funding and market risk the quality and level of earnings the quality of loans and investments the effectiveness of loan and investment policies and management’s overall ability to monitor and control financial and operational risks including the risks presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional banking activities in addition the riskbased capital rules incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments the market riskbased capital rules require banking organizations with large trading activities such as jpmorgan chase to maintain capital for market risk in an amount calculated by using the banking organizations’ own internal valueatrisk models subject to parameters set by the regulators the minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee has proposed a revision to the accord “basel ii” jpmorgan chase is actively pursuing implementation of the basel ii framework in accordance with the criteria of the us banking regulators which will require jpmorgan chase to use “advanced measurement techniques” employing its internal estimates of certain key risk drivers to derive capital requirements implementation of basel ii by us regulators is expected as of january 1 2008 with certain transitional implementation arrangements fdicia the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by their federal banking regulators among other things it requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally depend upon an institution’s classification within five capital categories the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as jpmorgan chase however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to glba as described below the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee as of december 31 2004 the firm and its primary banking subsidiaries were “wellcapitalized” fdic insurance assessments fdicia also requires the fdic to establish a riskbased assessment system for fdic deposit insurance under the fdic’s riskbased insurance premium assessment system each depository institution is assigned to one of nine risk classifications based upon certain capital and supervisory measures and depending upon its classification is assessed insurance premiums on its deposits 

powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured depository institution an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with such institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power 1 to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors 2 to enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or 3 to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution the above provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of those of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as jpmorgan chase bank and chase usa including without limitation obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued by those banks to investors referenced below as “public noteholders” in the public markets under federal law the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including public noteholders in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of the institution as a result whether or not the fdic would ever seek to repudiate any obligations held by public noteholders of any subsidiary of the firm that is an insured depository institution such as jpmorgan chase bank or chase usa the public noteholders would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors of the depository institution the usa patriot act on october 26 2001 president bush signed into law the usa patriot act of 2001 the “act” the act substantially broadens existing antimoney laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states imposes new compliance and due diligence obligations creates new crimes and penalties compels the production of documents located both inside and outside the united states including those of nonus institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the united states and clarifies the safe harbor from civil liability to customers the act mandates the us treasury department to issue a number of regulations to further clarify the act’s requirements or provide more specific guidance on their application the act requires all “financial institutions” as defined to establish certain antimoney laundering compliance and due diligence programs the act requires financial institutions that maintain correspondent accounts for nonus institutions or persons that are involved in private banking for “nonunited states persons” or their representatives to establish “appropriate specific and where necessary enhanced due diligence policies procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering through those accounts” 

part i jpmorgan chase believes its programs satisfy the requirements of the act bank regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and jpmorgan chase continues to enhance its antimoney laundering compliance programs other supervision and regulation under current federal reserve board policy jpmorgan chase is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support the bank subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy however because glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators glba prohibits the federal reserve board from requiring payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to such payment in such a case the federal reserve board could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture any loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary banks in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank at a certain level would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment the bank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to and certain other transactions with the firm and certain other affiliates and on investments in stock or securities of jpmorgan chase and those affiliates these restrictions prevent jpmorgan chase and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary unless the loans are secured in specified amounts the firm’s bank and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to direct supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities some of which are considered “functional regulators” under glba jpmorgan chase’s national bank subsidiaries such as jpmorgan chase bank and chase usa are subject to supervision and regulation by the occ and in certain matters by the federal reserve board and the fdic supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of the relevant bank’s business and condition as well as the imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and other powers the firm also conducts securities underwriting dealing and brokerage activities through jpmsi and other brokerdealer subsidiaries all of which are subject to the regulations of the sec and the national association of securities dealers inc “nasd” jpmsi is a member of the new york stock exchange “nyse” the operations of jpmorgan chase’s mutual funds also are subject to regulation by the sec the types of activities in which the nonus branches of jpmorgan chase bank and the international subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board those nonus branches and international subsidiaries also are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate the activities of jpmorgan chase bank and chase usa as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various federal laws including the truthinlending the equal credit opportunity the fair credit reporting the fair debt collection practice and the electronic funds transfer acts as well as various state laws these statutes impose 

requirements on the making enforcement and collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosures that need to be made in connection with such loans in addition under the requirements imposed by glba jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are required periodically to disclose to their retail customers the firm’s policies and practices with respect to 1 the sharing of nonpublic customer information with jpmorgan chase affiliates and others and 2 the confidentiality and security of that information under glba retail customers also must be given the opportunity to “opt out” of informationsharing arrangements with nonaffiliates subject to certain exceptions set forth in glba 

important factors that may affect future results from time to time the firm has made and will make forwardlooking statements these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts forwardlooking statements often use words such as “anticipate” “target” “expect” “estimate” “intend” “plan” “goal” “believe” or other words of similar meaning forwardlooking statements provide jpmorgan chase’s current expectations or forecasts of future events circumstances or results jpmorgan chase’s disclosures in this report including in the mda section contain forwardlooking statements the firm also may make forwardlooking statements in its other documents filed with the sec and in other written materials in addition the firm’s senior management may make forwardlooking statements orally to analysts investors representatives of the media and others any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the firm speak only as of the date they are made jpmorgan chase does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forwardlooking statement was made the reader should however consult any further disclosures of a forwardlooking nature jpmorgan chase may make in its annual reports on form 10k its quarterly reports on form 10q and its current reports on form 8k all forwardlooking statements by their nature are subject to risks and uncertainties jpmorgan chase’s actual future results may differ materially from those set forth in its forwardlooking statements factors that might cause the firm’s future financial performance to vary from that described in its forwardlooking statements include the credit market operational liquidity interest rate and other risks discussed in the mda section of this report and in other periodic reports filed with the sec in addition the following discussion sets forth certain risks and uncertainties that the firm believes could cause its actual future results to differ materially from expected results however other factors besides those listed below or discussed in jpmorgan chase’s reports to the sec also could adversely affect the firm’s results and the reader should not consider any such list of factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 merger of jpmorgan chase and bank one there are significant risks and uncertainties associated with the firm’s merger with bank one for example jpmorgan chase may fail to realize the growth opportunities and cost savings anticipated to be derived from the merger in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of 

key employees or that the disruption of ongoing business from the merger could adversely affect jpmorgan chase’s ability to maintain relationships with clients or suppliers business conditions and general economy the profitability of jpmorgan chase’s businesses could be affected by general economic conditions in the united states or abroad in 2004 both the us and global economies continued to strengthen overall while the outlook for the firm for 2005 continues to be cautiously optimistic there can be no assurances that the economic recovery that began in 2003 will continue throughout 2005 factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of equity prices and interest rates investor sentiment inflation and the availability and cost of credit could significantly affect the activity level of clients with respect to size number and timing of transactions involving the firm’s investment banking business including its underwriting and advisory businesses these factors also may affect the realization of cash returns from the firm’s private equity business a recurrence of a market downturn would likely lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its customers and therefore lead to a decline in the revenues it receives from trading commissions and spreads higher interest rates or continued weakness in the market also could affect the willingness of financial investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by jpmorgan chase the firm generally maintains large trading portfolios in the fixed income currency commodity and equity markets and has significant investment positions including merchant banking investments held by its private equity business the revenues derived from marktomarket values of the firm’s business are affected by many factors including its credit standing its success in proprietary positioning volatility in interest rates and in equity and debt markets and the economic political and business factors described below jpmorgan chase anticipates that these revenues will fluctuate over time the fees jpmorgan chase earns for managing assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect the valuations of the mutual funds managed by the firm which in turn could affect the firm’s revenues moreover even in the absence of a market downturn belowmarket performance by jpmorgan chase’s mutual funds could result in outflows of assets under management and therefore reduce the fees the firm receives the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet assets may be affected by business conditions in a poor economic environment there is a greater likelihood that more of the firm’s customers or counterparties could become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to jpmorgan chase which in turn could result in a higher levels of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses all of which would adversely affect the firm’s earnings the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions including us interest rates the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies as these factors will affect the level of consumer loans and credit quality competition jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects various factors to cause competitive conditions to continue to intensify the firm expects competition to intensify as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger 

bettercapitalized companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services and at more competitive prices in addition technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions to compete with technology companies in providing electronic and internetbased financial solutions nonus operations trading in nonus securities the firm does business throughout the world including in developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets jpmorgan chase’s businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable political and diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to nonus ownership jpmorgan chase also invests in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions including emerging markets revenues from the trading of nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated because generally nonus trading markets particularly in emerging market countries are smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets operational risk jpmorgan chase like all large corporations is exposed to many types of operational risk including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems given the high volume of transactions at jpmorgan chase certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified in addition the firm’s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect the firm may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control including for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to loss or liability to the firm the firm is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligation to the firm or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as is the firm and to the risk that the firm’s or its vendors’ business continuity and data security systems prove not to be sufficiently adequate the firm also faces the risk that the design of its controls and procedures prove inadequate or are circumvented thereby causing delays in detection or errors in information although the firm maintains a system of controls designed to keep operational risk at appropriate levels there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will not suffer losses from operational risks in the future that may be material in amount government monetary policies and economic controls jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by general economic conditions both domestic and international the firm’s businesses and earnings also are affected by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states nonus governments and international agencies for example policies and regulations of the federal reserve board influence directly and indirectly the rate of interest paid by commercial banks on their interestbearing deposits and also 

part i may affect the value of financial instruments held by the firm the actions of the federal reserve board also determine to a significant degree the firm’s cost of funds for lending and investing the nature and impact of future changes in economic and market conditions and fiscal policies are uncertain and are beyond the firm’s control in addition these policies and conditions can affect the firm’s customers and counterparties both in the united states and abroad which may increase the risk that such customers or counterparties default on their obligations to jpmorgan chase reputational and legal risk the firm’s ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged the failure of the firm to deal or to appear to fail to deal with various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to the firm and its business prospects these issues include but are not limited to appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues moneylaundering privacy recordkeeping sales and trading practices and the proper identification of the legal reputational credit liquidity and market risks inherent in its products failure to address appropriately these issues could also give rise to additional legal risk to the firm which in turn could increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted against the firm or subject the firm to enforcement actions fines and penalties credit market liquidity and private equity risk jpmorgan chase’s revenues also are dependent upon the extent to which management can successfully achieve its business strategies within a disciplined risk environment jpmorgan chase’s ability to grow its businesses is affected by pricing and competitive pressures as well as by the costs associated with the introduction of new products and services and the expansion and development of new distribution channels to the extent any of the instruments and strategies the firm uses to hedge or otherwise manage its exposure to market credit and private equity risk are not effective the firm may not be able to mitigate effectively its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk the firm’s balance sheet growth will be dependent upon the economic conditions described above as well as on its determination to securitize sell purchase or syndicate particular loans or loan portfolios the firm’s trading revenues and interest rate risk are dependent upon its ability to identify properly and mark to market changes in the value of its financial instruments caused by changes in market prices or rates the firm’s earnings will also be dependent upon how effectively its critical accounting estimates including those used in its private equity valuations prove accurate and upon how effectively it determines and assesses the cost of credit and manages its risk concentrations to the extent its assessments of migrations in credit quality and of risk concentrations or its assumptions or estimates used in establishing valuation models for the fair value of assets and liabilities or for loan loss reserves prove inaccurate or not predictive of actual results the firm could suffer higherthananticipated losses the successful management of credit market operational and private equity risk is an important consideration in managing the firm’s liquidity risk as evaluation by rating agencies of the management of these risks affects their determinations as to the firm’s credit ratings and therefore its cost of funds

banking jpmorgan partners and chase financial services a description of the firm’s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases are discussed in the “segment results” section of management’s discussion and analysis “mda” beginning on page 24 and in note 33 on page 108 competition jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment competitors include other banks brokerage firms investment banking companies merchant banks insurance companies mutual fund companies credit card companies mortgage banking companies automobile financing companies leasing companies ecommerce and other internetbased companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies jpmorgan chase’s businesses compete with these other firms with respect to the range of products and services offered and the types of clients customers industries and geographies served with respect to some of its geographies and products jpmorgan chase competes globally with respect to others the firm competes on a regional basis jpmorgan chase’s ability to compete effectively depends on the relative performance of its products the degree to which the features of its products appeal to customers and the extent to which the firm is able to meet its clients’ objectives or needs the firm’s ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain its professional and other personnel and on its reputation the financial services industry has experienced consolidation and convergence in recent years as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services industries have merged of which the merger of chase and jp morgan is an example this convergence trend is expected to continue and could result in competitors of jpmorgan chase gaining greater capital and other resources such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity it is possible that competition will become even more intense as the firm continues to compete with financial institutions that may be larger or better capitalized or may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies supervision and regulation permissible business activities the firm is subject to regulation under state and federal law including the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the “bhca” in november 1999 the grammleachbliley act “glba” was enacted which eliminated certain legal barriers separating the conduct of various types of financial services businesses such as commercial banking investment banking and insurance in addition glba substantially revamped the regulatory scheme within which financial institutions such as jpmorgan chase operate under glba bank holding companies meeting certain eligibility criteria may elect to become “financial holding companies” which may engage in any activities that are “financial in nature” as well as in additional activities that the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” and the united states department of the treasury “us treasury department” determine are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activities under glba “financial activities” specifically include insurance securities underwriting and dealing merchant banking investment advisory and lending activities jpmorgan chase elected to become a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 1   part i under regulations implemented by the federal reserve board if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to be “wellcapitalized” or “wellmanaged” as defined below the federal reserve board may impose corrective capital or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies in addition the federal reserve board may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies persist the regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the federal reserve board must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies the depository institution subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase currently meet the capital management and cra requirements necessary to permit the firm to conduct the broader activities permitted under glba however there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future regulation by federal reserve board under glba under glba’s system of “functional regulation” the federal reserve board acts as an “umbrella regulator” and certain of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries eg securities and investment advisory activities are regulated by the sec and insurance activities are regulated by state insurance commissioners the firm must continue to file reports and other information with and submit to examination by the federal reserve board as umbrella regulator however under glba with respect to matters affecting functionally regulated subsidiaries the federal reserve board is required to defer to the applicable functional regulators unless the federal reserve board concludes that the activities at issue pose a risk to a depository institution or breach a specific law the federal reserve board has authority to enforce effect of glba on bank brokerdealer and investment advisory activities to promote the system of functional regulation described above glba provides for the amendment of certain federal securities laws to eliminate various exemptions previously available to banks for example banks will no longer be generally exempt from the brokerdealer provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934 as a result jpmorgan chase’s bank subsidiaries will either need to register with the sec as brokerdealers or cease conducting many activities deemed brokerdealer activities glba does retain a more limited exemption from brokerdealer registration for certain “banking” products and activities including among others municipal and exempted securities transactions safekeeping and custody arrangements and trust securitization and derivatives products and activities the investment advisers act of 1940 has also been amended to eliminate certain provisions exempting banks from the registration requirements of that statute and the investment company act of 1940 has been amended to provide the sec with regulatory authority over various bank mutual fund activities the provisions discussed in this paragraph had an original effective date of may 12 2001 the sec has delayed the effective date of the provisions dealing with dealer registration until september 30 2003 the provisions dealing with registration as a broker are currently scheduled to be effective may 12 2003 however the sec has stated that it intends to promulgate proposed regulations prior to that date and the staff has indicated that there will be further extensions of the effective date to give banks sufficient time to comply with the sec’s implementing regulations dividend restrictions federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase that are chartered by a state and are member banks of the federal reserve system a “state member bank” or national banks nonbank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase are not subject to those limitations the amount of dividends that may be paid by a state member bank such as jpmorgan chase bank or by a national bank such as chase usa is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the bank obtains the approval of its appropriate federal banking regulator which in the case of a state member bank is the federal reserve board and in the case of a national bank is the office of the comptroller of the currency the “comptroller of the currency” under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided profits” similar restrictions on the payment of dividends by jpmorgan chase bank are imposed by new york law see note 25 on page 99 for the amount of dividends that the firm’s principal bank subsidiaries could pay at december 31 2002 and 2001 to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their relevant banking regulators in addition to the dividend restrictions described above the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including jpmorgan chase and its bank and bank holding company subsidiaries if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization capital requirements the federal banking regulators have adopted riskbased capital and leverage guidelines that require the firm’s capitaltoassets ratios meet certain minimum standards the riskbased capital ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet financial instruments into four weighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk under the guidelines capital is divided into two tiers tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital for a further discussion of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital see note 26 on page 99 the amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital 2   banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio total capital to riskweighted assets of 8 and a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 the riskbased capital requirements explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional banking activities and the management of those risks as important factors to consider in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy other factors taken into consideration by federal regulators include interest rate exposure liquidity funding and market risk the quality and level of earnings the quality of loans and investments the effectiveness of loan and investment policies and management’s overall ability to monitor and control financial and operational risks including the risks presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional banking activities in addition the riskbased capital rules incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments the market riskbased capital rules require banking organizations with large trading activities such as jpmorgan chase to maintain capital for market risk in an amount calculated by using the banking organizations’ own internal valueatrisk models subject to parameters set by the regulators the federal banking agencies amended their regulatory capital standards effective january 1 2002 to address the treatment of residual interests recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes the amendment defines “residual interests” as onbalance sheet interests that are retained by a seller after a securitization or other transfer of financial assets and that expose the seller to a greater than pro rata share of the credit risk in such assets under the amendment riskbased capital must be held in an amount equal to such residual interests even if that amount exceeds the full riskbased capital charge that would have been required to be held against the assets transferred the amendment also imposes a concentration limit of 25 of tier 1 capital on creditenhancing interestonly strips a type of residual interest requiring any amount in excess of that limit to be deducted from tier 1 capital the amendment also treats recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes such as letters of credit more consistently for riskbased capital purposes than previously the amendment introduces a multilevel approach to assessing capital requirements to positions in certain asset securitizations based on the credit ratings assigned to such position by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros for certain unrated positions other than residual interests the amendment provides alternative methods for assessing capital requirements including the limited use of a banking organization’s internal risk rating system and for positions arising under securitization programs covering multiple participants ratings assigned to the program by nrsros the federal banking agencies have also adopted effective april 1 2002 regulations that impose increased capital charges on a banking organization’s equity investments in nonfinancial companies in general the new riskbased capital requirements apply to such investments regardless of the legal authority under which they are made the level of capital charge increases as the banking organization’s concentration in such investments increases if the aggregate value of a banking organization’s nonfinancial equity investments is less than 15 of its tier 1 capital then 8 of such value is required to be deducted from the banking organization’s tier 1 capital if the aggregate value of a banking organization’s nonfinancial equity investments is more than 15 but less than 25 of the banking organization’s tier 1 capital the deduction increases to 12 of such value and if such aggregate value is more than 25 of the banking organization’s tier 1 capital the deduction rises to 25 the new charges do not apply to investments made prior to march 13 2000 equity investments made through small business investment companies in an amount equal to up to 15 of the banking organization’s tier 1 capital are exempt from the new charges but the full amount of the equity investments is still included when calculating the aggregate value of the banking organization’s nonfinancial equity investments the federal banking regulators have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by average total assets net of allowance for loan losses goodwill and certain intangible assets the minimum leverage ratio is 3 for strong bank holding companies ie those rated composite 1 under the bank subsidiaries other subsidiaries parent company earnings and capital adequacy or “bopec” rating system and for bank holding companies that have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile and growth plans tier 1 components capital surplus and common stock remain the most important forms of capital at jpmorgan chase because common equity has no maturity date and because dividends on common stock are paid only when and if declared by the board of directors common equity is available to absorb losses over long periods of time noncumulative perpetual preferred stock is similar to common stock in its ability to absorb losses if the board of directors does not declare a dividend on noncumulative perpetual preferred stock in any dividend period the holders of the instrument are never entitled to receive that dividend payment jpmorgan chase’s outstanding noncumulative preferred stock is a type commonly referenced as a “frap” a fixedrateadjustable preferred stock however because the interest rate on fraps may increase up to a predetermined ceiling the federal reserve board treats the firm’s noncumulative fraps in a manner similar to cumulative perpetual preferred and trust preferred securities the federal reserve board permits cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities to be included in tier 1 capital but only up to certain limits as these financial instruments do not provide as strong protection against losses as common equity and noncumulative nonfrap securities cumulative perpetual preferred stock does not have a maturity date similar to other forms of tier 1 capital however any dividends not declared on cumulative preferred stock accumulate and thus continue to be due to the holder of the instrument until all arrearages are satisfied trust preferred securities are a type of security generally issued by a specialpurpose trust established and owned by jpmorgan chase proceeds from the issuance to the public of the trust preferred security are lent to the firm for at least 30 but not more than 50 years the intercompany note 3   part i that evidences this loan provides that the interest payments by jpmorgan chase on the note may be deferred for up to five years during the period of any such deferral no payments of dividends may be made on any outstanding jpmorgan chase preferred or common stock or on the outstanding trust preferred securities issued to the public tier 2 components longterm subordinated debt generally having an original maturity of 1012 years is the primary form of jpmorgan chase’s tier 2 capital subordinated debt is deemed a form of regulatory capital because payments on the debt are subordinated to other creditors of jpmorgan chase including holders of senior and medium longterm debt and counterparties on derivative contracts under glba all financial holding companies are bank holding companies for purposes of the capital requirements described above however glba specifically prohibits the federal reserve board from imposing capital adequacy rules on certain functionally regulated subsidiaries such as brokerdealers and insurance companies that are in compliance with the applicable capital requirements of their functional regulators the minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee which is comprised of bank supervisors and central banks from the group of ten countries issued its capital accord in 1988 to achieve convergence in the capital regulations applicable to internationally active banking organizations the basel committee issued a proposed replacement for the capital accord in january 2001 and subsequently issued a number of working papers supplementing various aspects of that replacement the “new accord” based on these documents the new accord would adopt a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacy these pillars would include minimum capital requirements more emphasis on supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and greater reliance on market discipline under the new accord minimum capital requirements would be more differentiated based upon perceived distinctions in creditworthiness such requirements would be based either on ratings assigned by rating agencies or in the case of a banking organization that met certain supervisory standards on the organization’s internal credit ratings the minimum capital requirements in the new accord would also incorporate a capital charge for operational risk at present the target date for implementing the new accord is the end of 2006 fdicia the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” revised certain provisions of the federal deposit insurance act as well as certain other federal banking statutes in general fdicia provides for expanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by their federal banking regulators and among other things requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards pursuant to fdicia the federal reserve board the fdic and the comptroller of the currency adopted regulations setting forth a fivetier scheme for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions they supervise under the regulations commonly referred to as the “prompt corrective action” rules an institution would be placed in one of the following five capital categories when these ratios fall within the prescribed ranges  an institution may be treated as being in a capital category lower than that indicated based on other supervisory criteria supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally will depend upon an institution’s classification within the five capital categories the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as jpmorgan chase however subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to glba as described below the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary and may be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee as of december 31 2002 each of jpmorgan chase’s banking subsidiaries was “wellcapitalized” fdic insurance assessments fdicia also required the fdic to establish a riskbased assessment system for fdic deposit insurance under the fdic’s riskbased insurance premium assessment system each depository institution is assigned to one of nine risk classifications based upon certain capital and supervisory measures and depending upon its classification is assessed insurance premiums on its deposits depository institutions insured by the bank insurance fund are required to pay premiums ranging from 0 basis points to 27 basis points of us deposits each of jpmorgan chase’s banks including jpmorgan chase bank and chase usa currently qualifies for the 0 basis point assessment legislation has been introduced in congress that if enacted would give the fdic discretion to impose deposit insurance premiums on all depository institutions in addition if the ratio of insured deposits to money in the bank insurance fund drops below specified levels the fdic would be required to impose premiums on all banks insured by the bank insurance fund all depository institutions must also pay an annual assessment so that the financing corporation “fico” may pay interest on bonds it issued in connection with the resolution of savings association insolvencies occurring prior to 1991 the fico assessment for the first quarter of 2003 is 168 basis points 4   of us deposits the rate schedules are subject to future adjustments by the fdic in addition the fdic has authority to impose special assessments from time to time subject to certain limitations specified in the deposit insurance funds act powers of the fdic upon insolvency of an insured depository institution an fdicinsured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another fdicinsured institution under common control with such institution being in “default” or “in danger of default” commonly referred to as “crossguarantee” liability “default” is generally defined as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and “in danger of default” is defined as certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur absent regulatory assistance an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power 1 to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors 2 to enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or 3 to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution the above provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of those of jpmorgan chase’s subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as jpmorgan chase bank and chase usa including without limitation obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued by those banks to investors referred to below as “public noteholders” in the public markets under federal law the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities including the fdic as subrogee of the depositors have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including public noteholders in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of the institution as a result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any obligations held by public noteholders of any subsidiary of the firm that is an insured depository institution such as jpmorgan chase bank or chase usa the public noteholders would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors of the depository institution the usa patriot act following the september 11 2001 attacks on new york and washington dc the united states government acted in several ways to tighten control on activities perceived to be connected to money laundering and terrorist funding beginning on september 23 2001 president bush issued a series of orders which identify terrorists and terrorist organizations and require the blocking of property and assets of as well as prohibiting all transactions or dealing with such terrorists terrorist organizations and those that assist or sponsor them on october 26 2001 president bush signed into law the usa patriot act of 2001 the “act” the act substantially broadens existing antimoney laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states imposes new compliance and due diligence obligations creates new crimes and penalties compels the production of documents located both inside and outside the united states including those of nonus institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the united states and clarifies the safe harbor from civil liability to customers the act mandates the us treasury department to issue a number of regulations to further clarify the act’s requirements or provide more specific guidance on their application the act requires all “financial institutions” as defined to establish antimoney laundering compliance and due diligence programs such programs must include among other things adequate policies the designation of a compliance officer employee training programs and an independent audit function to review and test the program jpmorgan chase has had in place pursuant to previously existing laws and regulations a “know your customer” policy and an antimoney laundering compliance program which requires as appropriate based on a riskbased analysis performing due diligence with respect to establishing the identity and address of the beneficial owners of an account the source of the account’s funds and the proposed use of the account as well as requiring the identification and reporting of suspicious transactions to appropriate law enforcement authorities jpmorgan chase believes its programs satisfy the requirements of the act the act requires financial institutions that maintain correspondent accounts for nonus institutions or persons or that are involved in private banking for “nonunited states persons” or their representatives to establish “appropriate specific and where necessary enhanced due diligence policies procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering through those accounts” in furtherance of these provisions the act mandates specific minimum standards regarding the establishment of private banking accounts and prohibits financial institutions from establishing maintaining administering or managing correspondent accounts with any nonus bank that does not have a physical presence in any jurisdiction unless the socalled “shell bank” is affiliated with a regulated physicallyestablished bank jpmorgan chase will continue to revise and update its “know your customer” policy and its antimoney laundering programs to reflect changes required by the act and the us treasury department regulations to be issued thereunder in order to remain in compliance with the act and its provisions other supervision and regulation under current federal reserve board policy jpmorgan chase is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support the bank subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy however because glba provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators glba prohibits the federal reserve board from requiring payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to such payment in such a case the federal reserve board could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture 5   part i any loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary banks in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank at a certain level will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment the bank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to and certain other transactions with the firm and certain other affiliates and on investments in stock or securities of jpmorgan chase and those affiliates these restrictions prevent jpmorgan chase and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary unless the loans are secured in specified amounts the firm’s bank and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to direct supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities many of which will be considered “functional regulators” under glba jpmorgan chase bank as a new york statechartered bank and a state member bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the new york state banking department as well as by the federal reserve board and the fdic jpmorgan chase’s national bank subsidiaries such as chase usa are subject to substantially similar supervision and regulation by the comptroller of the currency supervision and regulation by each of the foregoing regulatory agencies generally include comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of the relevant bank’s business and condition as well as the imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and other powers the firm also conducts securities underwriting dealing and brokerage activities through jpmsi and other brokerdealer subsidiaries all of which are subject to the regulations of the sec and the national association of securities dealers inc jpmsi is a member of the new york stock exchange the operations of jpmorgan chase’s mutual funds also are subject to regulation by the sec the types of activities in which the nonus branches of jpmorgan chase bank and the international subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board those nonus branches and international subsidiaries also are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate the activities of jpmorgan chase bank and chase usa as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various federal laws including the truthinlending the equal credit opportunity the fair credit reporting the fair debt collection practice and the electronic funds transfer acts as well as various state laws these statutes impose requirements on the making enforcement and collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosures that need to be made in connection with such loans in addition under the requirements imposed by glba jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are required periodically to disclose to their retail customers the firm’s policies and practices with respect to 1 the sharing of nonpublic customer information with jpmorgan chase affiliates and others and 2 the confidentiality and security of that information under glba retail customers also must be given the opportunity to “opt out” of information sharing arrangements with nonaffiliates subject to certain exceptions set forth in glba important factors that may affect future results from time to time the firm has made and will make forwardlooking statements these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts forwardlooking statements often use words such as “anticipate” “target” “expect” “estimate” “intend” “plan” “goal” “believe” or other words of similar meaning forwardlooking statements give jpmorgan chase’s current expectations or forecasts of future events circumstances or results jpmorgan chase’s disclosure in this report including in the mda section contains forwardlooking statements the firm also may make forwardlooking statements in its other documents filed with the sec and in other written materials in addition the firm’s senior management may make forwardlooking statements orally to analysts investors representatives of the media and others any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the firm speak only as of the date they are made jpmorgan chase does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forwardlooking statement was made the reader should however consult any further disclosures of a forwardlooking nature jpmorgan chase may make in its annual reports on form 10k its quarterly reports on form 10q and its current reports on form 8k all forwardlooking statements by their nature are subject to risks and uncertainties the firm’s actual future results may differ materially from those set forth in jpmorgan chase’s forwardlooking statements factors that might cause jpmorgan chase’s future financial performance to vary from that described in its forwardlooking statements include the credit market operational liquidity interest rate and other risks discussed in the mda section of this report and in other periodic reports filed with the sec in addition the following discussion sets forth certain risks and uncertainties that the firm believes could cause its actual future results to differ materially from expected results however other factors besides those listed below or discussed in jpmorgan chase’s reports to the sec also could adversely affect the firm’s results and the reader should not consider any such list of factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 business conditions and general economy the profitability of jpmorgan chase’s businesses could be adversely affected by a worsening of general economic conditions in the united states or abroad the difficult global market and economic conditions that existed in 2001 continued in 2002 and this challenging environment could persist for some period of time in 2003 uncertainties in the financial markets have been exacerbated by investor concerns over the integrity of the us financial markets and uncertainty surrounding terrorists threats and the possible outbreak of war factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets the level and volatility of equity prices and interest rates investor sentiment inflation and the availability and cost of credit could significantly affect the activity level of clients with respect to size number and timing of transactions effected by the firm’s investment banking business including its underwriting and advisory 6   businesses and also may affect the realization of cash returns from jpmorgan chase’s private equity business a further market downturn would likely lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that jpmorgan chase executes for its customers and therefore lead to a decline in the revenues it receives from trading commissions and spreads higher interest rates or continued weakness in the market also could affect the willingness of financial investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by jpmorgan chase the firm generally maintains large trading portfolios in the fixed income currency commodity and equity markets and has significant investment positions including merchant banking investments at jpmorgan partners the revenues derived from marktomarket values of jpmorgan chase’s business are affected by many factors including jpmorgan chase’s credit standing its success in proprietary positioning volatility in interest rates and in equity and debt markets and the economic political and business factors described below jpmorgan chase anticipates that these revenues will experience volatility from time to time continued market weakness or worsening of the economy could cause the firm to incur marktomarket losses in the values of these positions a market downturn also could result in a decline in the fees jpmorgan chase earns for managing assets for example a higher level of us or nonus interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect the flows of moneys to or from the mutual funds managed by the firm moreover even in the absence of a market downturn belowmarket performance by jpmorgan chase’s mutual funds could result in a decline in assets under management and therefore in the fees the firm receives an economic downturn or significantly higher interest rates could adversely affect the credit quality of jpmorgan chase’s onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet assets by increasing the risk that a greater number of the firm’s customers would become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to jpmorgan chase further a continuing challenging economic environment could lead to a higher rate of delinquencies by customers or counterparties which in turn would result in a higher level of chargeoffs and a higher level of provision for credit losses for jpmorgan chase all of which could adversely affect the firm’s earnings the firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions including us interest rates the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies as these factors will affect the level of consumer loans and credit quality competition jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects various factors to cause competitive conditions to continue to intensify for example technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions to compete with technology companies in providing electronic and internetbased financial solutions in addition the firm expects crossindustry competition to continue to intensify particularly as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger bettercapitalized companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services and at more competitive prices nonus operations trading in nonus securities the firm does business throughout the world including in developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets jpmorgan chase’s businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable political and diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to nonus ownership jpmorgan chase also invests in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions including emerging markets revenues from the trading of nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated because generally nonus trading markets particularly in emerging market countries are smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets operational risk jpmorgan chase like all large corporations is exposed to many types of operational risk including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or errors resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems given the high volume of transactions at jpmorgan chase certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified in addition the firm’s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect the firm may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control including for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to loss or liability to the firm the firm is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligation to the firm or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as is the firm and to the risk that its or its vendors’ business continuity and data security systems prove not to be sufficiently adequate although jpmorgan chase maintains a system of controls designed to keep operational risk at appropriate levels the firm has in the past suffered losses from operational risk and there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will not suffer losses from operational risks in the future government monetary policies and economic controls jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by general economic conditions both domestic and international jpmorgan chase’s businesses and earnings also are affected by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the us nonus governments and international agencies for example policies and regulations of the federal reserve board influence directly and indirectly the rate of interest paid by commercial banks on their interestbearing deposits and also may impact the value of financial instruments held by the firm these actions of the federal reserve board also determine to a significant degree the cost to jpmorgan chase of funds for lending and investing the nature and impact of future changes in economic and market conditions and fiscal policies are not predictable and are beyond jpmorgan chase’s control in addition these policies and conditions can impact the firm’s cus 7   part i tomers and counterparties both in the us and abroad which may increase the risk that such customers or counterparties default on their obligations to jpmorgan chase reputational and legal risk the firm’s ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged the failure of the firm to deal or to appear to fail to deal with various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to the firm and its business prospects these issues include but are not limited to appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues moneylaundering privacy recordkeeping sales and trading practices and the proper identification of the legal reputational credit liquidity and market risks inherent in its products failure to address appropriately these issues could also give rise to additional legal risk to the firm which could in turn increase the size and number of claims and damages asserted against the firm or subject the firm to enforcement actions fines and penalties credit market liquidity and private equity risk jpmorgan chase’s revenues also are dependent upon the extent to which management can successfully achieve its business strategies within a disciplined risk environment jpmorgan chase’s ability to grow its businesses is affected by pricing and competitive pressures as well as by the costs associated with the introduction of new products and services and the expansion and development of new distribution channels the ability of management to utilize the “shareholder value added” methodology to evaluate investment opportunities and the ability to maintain expense discipline will be important factors in determining the extent to which the firm achieves its financial targets in addition to the extent any of the instruments and strategies jpmorgan chase uses to hedge or otherwise manage its exposure to market credit and private equity risk are not effective the firm may not be able to mitigate effectively its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk jpmorgan chase’s balance sheet growth will be dependent upon the economic conditions described above as well as on its determination to securitize sell purchase or syndicate particular loans or loan portfolios jpmorgan chase’s trading revenues and interest rate risk are dependent upon its ability to identify properly and marktomarket changes in the value of its financial instruments caused by changes in market prices or rates the firm’s earnings will also be dependent upon how effectively it determines and assesses the cost of credit and manages risk concentrations including exposure limits for industry and singlename obligors to the extent its assessment of migrations in credit quality risk concentrations or assumptions or estimates used in establishing its loan loss reserves prove inaccurate or not predictive of actual results the firm could suffer higherthananticipated credit losses the successful management of credit market operational and private equity risk is an important consideration in managing the firm’s liquidity risk as evaluation by rating agencies of the management of these risks affects their determinations as to the firm’s credit ratings and therefore its cost of funds nonus operations for geographic distributions of total revenue total expense income before income tax expense and net income see note 32 on page 107 for a discussion of nonus loans see note 9 on page 81 and the sections entitled “country exposure” in the mda on page 53 and “crossborder outstandings” on page 122 item 2 properties the headquarters of jpmorgan chase is located in new york city at 270 park avenue which is a 50story bank and office

downturn and by the consolidation of operations as a result of the merger jpmorgan chase will continue to evaluate its current and projected space requirements and as opportunities arise may dispose of additional premises although there is no assurance that it will be able to do so nor is there any assurance that the firm will not have to incur additional charges in connection with any such

price as a precondition to receiving allocations on february 13 2003 the court denied the motions of jpmorgan chase and others to dismiss the securities complaints jpmorgan chase also has received various subpoenas and informal requests from governmental and other agencies seeking information relating to initial public offering allocation practices on february 20 2003 the national association

to the resolution of the charges jpmsi neither admitted nor denied the nasd’s contentions jpmsi has been advised by the sec that it is also considering bringing a disciplinary action against jpmsi jpmsi has submitted to the staff of the sec a letter outlining the basis for jpmsi’s position that no such action is warranted and is currently in discussions with the sec research analysts’ conflicts on december 20 2002 the firm reached an agreement in principle with the sec the nasd the new york stock exchange the new york state attorney general’s office and the north american securities administrators association on behalf of state securities regulators to resolve their investigations of jpmorgan chase relating to research analyst independence pursuant to the agreement in principle

taken to ensure the integrity of jpmorgan chase analyst research iii to contribute 25 million spread over five years to provide independent thirdparty research to clients and iv to contribute 5 million towards investor education the settlement is subject to finalization of mutually satisfactory settlement documents and must be approved by the sec and state regulatory authorities litigation reserve and other during the fourth quarter of 2002 the firm established a reserve of 900 million related to costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with the various private litigations and regulatory inquiries involving enron and the other material legal actions proceedings and investigations discussed above this reserve represents management’s best estimate after consultation with counsel of the current probable aggregate costs associated with these matters of the 900 million 600 million has been allocated to the various cases proceedings and investigations associated with enron the balance of 300 million has been allocated to the various litigations proceedings and investigations involving the firm’s debt and equity underwriting activities and equity research practices and includes the 80 million settlement in december 2002 relating to equity research practices it is possible that the reserve could be subject to revision in the future in addition to the various cases proceedings and investigations for which the reserve has been established jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of other legal actions and governmental proceedings arising in connection with their respective businesses additional actions investigations or proceedings may be brought from time to time in the future in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the cases present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties the firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of the pending matters including the pending matters as to which the reserve has been established will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss related to each pending matter will be subject to the foregoing caveat jpmorgan chase anticipates based upon its current knowledge after consultation with counsel and after taking into account the establishment of the aforementioned 900 million reserve that the outcome of the legal actions proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the firm although the outcome of a particular proceeding or the imposition of a particular fine or penalty may be material to jpmorgan chase’s operating results for a particular period depending upon among other factors the size of the loss or liability and the level of jpmorgan chase’s income for that period 10

overview jp morgan chase  co is a leading global financial services firm with assets of 759 billion and operations in more than 50 countries the firm serves more than 30 million consumer customers and the world’s most prominent corporate institutional and government clients the firm’s wholesale businesses are comprised of the investment bank treasury  securities services investment management  private banking and jpmorgan partners chase financial services is composed of the firm’s retail and middle market businesses financial performance of jpmorgan chase  bp denotes basis points 100 bp equals 1 jp morgan chase co “jpmorgan chase” or the “firm” reported 2002 net income of 17 billion or 080 per share compared with net income of 17 billion or 080 per share in 2001 the results for the year were negatively affected by sluggish capital markets by concentrated exposures in certain segments of the firm’s private equity and commercial credit portfolios by large charges related to litigation and by continuing integration expenses resulting from the merger of jp morgan and chase on the positive side the consumer businesses reported record results and treasury  securities services “tss” had a solid year highlighting the benefits of the firm’s diversified business model as a result of the firm’s balance of businesses 2002 total reported revenues of 296 billion were up 1 from 2001 the national consumer credit businesses at chase financial services “cfs” benefited from the lowinterest rate environment with the mortgage company in particular having an exceptional year tss reported modest revenue growth as strong gains in treasury services and institutional trust services offset a decline in investor services at the investment bank “ib” the slowerthanexpected economic recovery and diminished investor confidence led to continued weakness in capital markets activity which was reflected in lower trading revenue and investment banking fees investment management  private banking “impb” revenues declined as a result of lower global equity valuations and reduced investor activity assets under supervision declined primarily due to market depreciation and institutional outflows deterioration in equity markets adversely affected jpmorgan partners “jpmp” writeoffs and writedowns of private holdings and net marktomarket losses on public securities were not offset by cash gains as financing and exit opportunities remained constrained the firm’s total reported noninterest expense declined 4 from 2001 and included several large charges in both years in 2002 the costs associated with merger and restructuring initiatives were 12 billion versus 25 billion the previous year also in 2002 the firm recorded a 13 billion charge in connection with the settlement of its enronrelated surety litigation and the establishment of a reserve related to certain material litigation proceedings and investigations and recorded a 01 billion charge related to excess real estate excluding the impact of these charges in both years the firm’s fullyear 2002 noninterest expense of 202 billion was lower than that of 2001 in addition in 2002 the firm announced several programs aiming to align expense levels with lower revenue prospects severance and related costs from these initiatives added 890 million to noninterest expense for the year approximately 70 of which were in ib despite those costs all business segments reported lowertoflat noninterest expenses except cfs where higher business volumes drove expense growth ib reduced headcount in line with lower market activity levels impb has reduced its expense runrate by more than half a billion dollars since the beginning of 2001 in tss tight expense management allowed for investments while keeping expense levels flat with 2001 levels the firm’s expenses were further reduced by the adoption in 2002 of sfas 142 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill the provision for credit losses increased 36 from 2001 this was principally attributable to troubled commercial credits in the telecommunications and cable sectors partially offset by a decrease in the consumer provision in addition to analyzing results on a reported basis management looks at results on an “operating basis” to assess the overall firm and each of its business segments and to facilitate an estimate of future earnings for the business segments absent unusual events jpmorgan chase’s operating earnings which exclude merger and restructuring costs and special items were 34 billion compared with 38 billion in 2001 for additional information and a reconciliation between the firm’s reported and operating results see pages 22 and 23 risk management management of credit market operational and private equity risk is central to the firm’s businesses total nonperforming assets rose to 48 billion at december 31 2002 an increase of 22 from yearend 2001 primarily as a result of significant and rapid deterioration in credit quality in the telecommunications cable and merchant energy sectors the firm established a more stringent exposure review process and lower absolute exposure limits for industry and singlename concentrations including investmentgrade obligors    management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co 

market risk parameters across the firm remained stable and trading results were within valueatrisk “var” limits throughout the year the firm continued to develop its selfassessment operational riskevent monitoring and internal control processes to enhance its operational risk management discipline the firm created a policy review office to enhance the procedures it uses to examine transactions with clients in terms of appropriateness ethical issues and reputational risk the policy review office has intensified the scrutiny of the firm’s transactions from the client’s point of view with the goal that these transactions are not used to deceive investors or others finally the firm reviewed the level of private equity risk in its portfolio and has decided to reduce over time the amount of capital invested in private equity to approximately 10 of the firm’s common stockholders’ equity from approximately 20 at december 31 2002 capital and liquidity management at december 31 2002 the firm’s tier 1 capital ratio was 82 compared with 83 at yearend 2001 in the third quarter the board of directors declared its intention to continue the current quarterly dividend of 034 per share on the firm’s common stock provided that capital ratios remain strong and earnings prospects exceed the current dividend sound liquidity management remains an important factor in maintaining the firm’s credit ratings liquidity management takes into account the need to fund both on and offbalance sheet liabilities and commitments it seeks to ensure that the firm’s obligations will be met even if access to funding is temporarily impaired although the firm’s debt ratings were downgraded one notch this year to aaaa3 at jpmorgan chase bank and to aa1 at the holding company the firm’s funding costs and capital markets businesses were not materially adversely affected corporate governance the firm has adopted the new york stock exchange proposals relating to corporate governance practices for boards of directors and has posted the board’s practices as well as charters of the principal board committees on the firm’s website wwwjpmorganchasecom the firm seeks to be a leader in corporate governance and disclosure practices business outlook global economic conditions and activity in financial markets are expected to remain uncertain in 2003 accordingly the outlook for the firm’s investment banking and capital markets activities remains cautious earnings improvements in ib are anticipated to be primarily driven in 2003 by lower credit costs in a still challenging — but stabilizing — credit environment and by lower expenses at cfs continuation of the current lowinterest rate environment should enable the creditrelated businesses mortgage credit card and auto to perform well although it is likely revenues and earnings will be lower than the record set in 2002 which included large net gains on hedging of mortgage servicing rights “msrs” expenses for the firm in 2003 may be slightly higher than in 2002 excluding from 2002 expenses the impact of the litigation and merger charges expensing stock options higher pension and occupancy costs and increased spending primarily at cfs are likely to more than offset the savings anticipated from ib rightsizing initiatives and lower severance costs despite this cautious view for the short term the firm remains committed to its diversified business model and believes that it is well positioned to produce higher returns when economic conditions improve and capital markets recover results of operations this section discusses jpmorgan chase’s results of operations on a reported basis the accompanying financial data conforms with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes beginning on page 71 investment banking fees were 24 lower than last year reflecting the industrywide slowdown in corporate ma activities and new issuance of debt and equity securities advisory fees of 756 million were 39 lower than last year and underwriting fees for debt and equity instruments of 20 billion were 15 lower than last year for a table that breaks out investment banking fees see note 4 on page 77 and for a further discussion on these revenues see the ib results on pages 26—28 revenues  nmnot meaningful the 47 decline in trading revenue was primarily attributable to the challenging market conditions that persisted throughout 2002    equity markets declined substantially contributing to lower client activity and revenues primarily in equity derivatives also contributing to lower equity trading results was a shift in the classification of brokerdealer trading revenues from “trading revenues” in 2001 to “brokerage and investment services fees” in 2002 beginning in 2001 bid and offer prices on nasdaq stocks were quoted in dollars and cents instead of fractions of whole dollars as a result in 2002 jpmorgan chase began to negotiate with its institutional clients commissionbased pricing structures that would support the costs of delivering enhanced brokerage services in connection with their nasdaq trades revenues earned from agreedupon commissions are now recorded as “brokerage and investment services” within fees and commissions fixed income trading revenues declined 33 from last year as lower portfolio management results primarily in interest rate trading offset an overall increase in client activity trading revenue on a reported basis excludes the impact of net interest income related to ib’s trading activities this income is recorded within net interest income however in assessing the profitability of ib’s trading business the firm combines these revenues for segment reporting for a table that breaks out trading revenues see note 3 on page 76 and for a further discussion on these revenues see the ib results on pages 26–28 fees and commissions fees and commissions were 108 billion in 2002 an increase of 13 from last year reflecting the following  these fees and commissions were offset by lower investment management custody and processing service fees these fees were down 5 to 38 billion in 2002 primarily a result of the lower value of equityrelated assets under supervision at impb as well as lower fees earned at tss from nonus assets under custody both investment management and custody fees were affected by the decline in the value of assets under supervision and assets under custody respectively as these fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the total market value of the assets also contributing to the lower fees was the marketdriven slowdown in securities lending as well as a decrease in processing service fees for unit investment trusts brokerage and investment services declined slightly despite the aforementioned reclassification into this line of approximately 100 million of brokerdealer revenues related to nasdaq transactions the decline was the result of reduced trading volume and narrower spreads on brokerage transactions for a table showing the components of fees and commissions see note 4 on page 77 private equity gains losses aggregate private equity losses realized and unrealized totaled 746 million in 2002 reflecting the continuing difficult capital markets environment the private equity markets offered limited exit opportunities and constrained financing thereby depressing realized gains further the results in 2002 reflected net marktomarket losses on public securities as well as writedowns and writeoffs on private holdings particularly in the telecommunications and technology sectors for a further discussion of private equity gains losses see jpmp results on pages 33–34 securities gains securities gains of 16 billion were up 80 from last year of these gains 11 billion was attributable to the firm’s availableforsale “afs” investment securities portfolio which was favorably positioned in a lower interest rate environment the balance was directly related to the hedging of msrs that offset impairment charges due to mortgage prepayments for a further discussion of securities gains see both the ib and chase home finance discussions on pages 26–28 and 36 respectively other revenue the increase in other revenue of 260 million reflected the following     management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co 

 for a table that breaks out other revenue see note 4 on page 78 net interest income net interest income “nii” rose 7 to 115 billion compared with 108 billion in 2001 the primary contributors to the increase were the significant growth in average consumer loans which were 7 higher than last year and higher tradingrelated nii these were offset by a decline in commercial loans and the narrowing of spreads in the deposit businesses average consumer loan volume grew benefiting from low interest rates as well as the acquisition in february 2002 of the providian master trust including 79 billion of credit card receivables and related relationships total average credit card receivables rose 11 to 216 billion of this amount 48 billion related to providian nii at chase home finance increased due to higher average availableforsale mortgage loans higher spreads and lower asset funding costs nii related to commercial loans declined the result of lower outstanding volumes at the same time spreads narrowed reflecting the reduction in interest rates also contributing to the decline was the higher level of nonperforming loans nonperforming commercial loans rose 84 to 37 billion for a further discussion of nonperforming loans in the commercial portfolio see page 47 a portion of the firm’s nii relates to tradingrelated assets in 2002 this component was 19 billion compared with 14 billion in the prior year the increase was attributable to the change in the composition of trading assets and improved spreads on an aggregate basis the firm’s total average interestearning assets for 2002 were 555 billion compared with 547 billion last year the net interest spread on these assets on a fully taxableequivalent basis was 209 in 2002 10 basis points higher than last year expenses  nm not meaningful 

compensation expense compensation expense in 2002 was 110 billion 7 lower than last year and included severance costs of 746 million associated with expense initiatives undertaken during the year in 2001 severance related to the merger of jp morgan and chase and other previously announced restructuring programs was recorded within merger and restructuring costs the decline reflected reductions in staffing levels as well as lower incentives reflecting the lower level of earnings the amounts accrued for incentives are subject to management’s discretion and to calculations that correlate incentives with income before incentives expensemanagement programs had a significant impact in ib and to a lesser extent impb the two business segments whose revenues were most negatively affected by the downturn in the economy as a result these two segments reduced the number of employees in their businesses also contributing to the decline in expenses was the reversal of previously accrued expenses of 120 million related to forfeitable stockbased compensation awards issued under employee benefit plans the awards contained stock price targets that were deemed unlikely to be attained within the timeframes specified under the terms of the awards the decline in compensation expense was partially offset by the hiring of new employees at expanding business segments primarily cfs and tss the total number of fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2002 was 94335 compared with 95812 at the prior yearend although overall levels remained relatively stable headcount in ib and impb was reduced by approximately 3100 fulltime equivalent employees whereas in cfs headcount increased by more than 2400 the firm reviews the actuarial assumptions for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans on an annual basis to reflect the decline in market interest rates during 2002 the yearend discount rate for the firm’s us plans was set at 650 a 75basis point decline from the prior year additionally considering the current mix of plan assets the yearend assumed longterm rate of return was adjusted downward to 800 for both us pension plan assets and other postretirement benefit plan assets from 925 and 900 respectively the assumed longterm rate of return is a blended average of the firm’s investment advisor’s projected longterm 10 years or more returns for various asset classes the impact of these changes is expected to increase 2003 us pension and other postretirement benefit expenses by approximately 60 million additionally the adverse effect of losses on us plan assets is expected to further increase us pension and other postretirement benefit expenses by approximately 70 million in 2002 these expenses included curtailment charges and special termination benefits totaling 64 million resulting from managementinitiated and outsourcingrelated employee terminations actuarial assumptions for the firm’s various nonus plans also were adjusted to reflect local market conditions the impact of these changes on non    us pension and other postretirement benefit expenses is not expected to be material for further information on postretirement employee benefit plans see note 23 on pages 94–96 occupancy expense occupancy expense rose 19 from last year partly the result of a 98 million charge in the third quarter of 2002 to cover the costs of exiting excess vacant premises on the west coast of the united states principally in the san francisco area also contributing to the increase was the leasing of additional space in new jersey and in midtown manhattan partly necessitated by the relocation of certain functions at the beginning of the year from a previouslyowned building in downtown manhattan the firm expects 2003 occupancy costs to increase by approximately 150 million due to the move to midtown manhattan extra safety measures and higher anticipated real estate taxes in new york technology and communications expense the decline in technology and communications expense was primarily attributable to an initiative to rationalize and reshape the firm’s technology infrastructure this initiative resulted in reduced spending for software equipment and workstations additionally the technology sourcing process was streamlined in favor of a select list of preferred vendors resulting in additional expense reductions the impact of these initiatives was partially offset by the higher amortization of capitalized software as well as expenditures to enhance the telecommunications network amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles declined 56 from 2001 the decline primarily reflected the implementation of sfas 142 which now requires a periodic review of goodwill for impairment rather than the amortization of goodwill as was the case last year this was partly offset by the impact of the acquisition of the providian master trust’s credit card relationship intangibles in 2002 there were no impairments recognized on goodwill recorded the consolidated balance sheet for a discussion on the impact of sfas 142 on the firm’s amortization of intangibles expense and the expected level of expense for 2003 see note 14 on page 89 other expense other expense increased 6 in 2002 compared with 2001 as a result of the following for the table showing the components within other expense see note 6 on page 79  these expense increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense of 42 million surety settlement and litigation reserve the 13 billion charge in 2002 reflected the settlement of the enronrelated surety litigation and the establishment of a litigation reserve on january 2 2003 the firm announced it had settled its dispute with 11 insurance companies that had issued surety bonds that guaranteed obligations of enron corp “enron” under prepaid commodity forward contracts the firm settled for 60 of the principal amount of the bonds and received a cash payment of 502 million and 75 million of unsecured claims in connection with this agreement — and one additional ongoing lawsuit related to a prepaid contract backed by a letter of credit — the firm took a pretax charge of 400 million approximately 260 million aftertax the firm also established a 900 million reserve approximately 600 million aftertax related to litigation and regulatory matters involving enron as well as other material legal actions proceedings and investigations in which it is involved merger and restructuring costs during 2002 the firm incurred merger and restructuring costs of 12 billion a 52 decline from 2001 refer to the discussion of compensation expense on page 20 for a description of other severance costs incurred in 2002 and to note 6 on page 78 provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses increased 11 billion or 36 from the prior year primarily reflecting higher chargeoffs of loans and lendingrelated commitments in the telecommunications and cable sectors the consumer provision decreased 21 from last year reflecting growth in credit card securitizations partially offset by the impact of the providian acquisition in 2002 the firm increased the allowance for credit losses by 443 million by making provisions in excess of net chargeoffs compared with an 850 million increase in the allowance last year for further information on the provision for credit losses see page 56 income tax expense jpmorgan chase recognized income tax expense of 856 million in 2002 compared with 847 million in 2001 the effective tax rate was 34 in 2002 versus 33 last year the increase in the effective tax rate was principally attributable to the level of income in certain state and local tax jurisdictions in 2002 for a further discussion of income taxes see note 22 on

risk and capital management risk management at jpmorgan chase is guided by several principles including  risk management and oversight begins with the risk policy committee of the board of directors which reviews the governance of these activities delegating the formulation of policy and daytoday risk oversight and management to the executive committee and to the two corporate risk committees capital and risk management the executive committee provides guidance regarding strategies and risk appetite and is responsible for an integrated view of risk exposures including the interdependencies among jpmorgan chase’s various risk categories the capital committee focuses on firmwide capital planning internal capital allocation and liquidity management the risk management committee focuses on credit risk market risk operational risk private equity risk and fiduciary risk both risk committees have decisionmaking authority with major policy decisions and risk exposures subject to review by the executive committee in addition to the risk policy committee the audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for discussion of guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken in addition the audit committee reviews with management the system of internal controls and financial reporting that is relied upon to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with the firm’s operational risk management processes the firm’s use of sva which incorporates a riskadjusted capital methodology as its primary performance measure has strengthened its risk management discipline by charging the businesses the cost of capital linked to the risks associated with their respective activities for a discussion of capital allocation methodologies see the respective risk management sections on pages 4565    capital and liquidity management capital management jpmorgan chase’s capital management framework helps to optimize the use of capital by    available versus required capital  economic risk capital jpmorgan chase assesses capital adequacy utilizing internal risk assessment methodologies the firm assigns economic capital based primarily on four risk factors the methodology quantifies credit market and operating risk for each business and for jpmp private equity risk and assigns capital accordingly these methodologies are discussed in the risk management sections of this annual report capital also is assessed against business units for certain nonrisk factors businesses are assessed capital equal to 100 of any goodwill and 50 for certain other intangibles generated through acquisitions additionally jpmorgan chase assesses an “asset capital tax” against managed assets and some offbalance sheet instruments these assessments recognize that certain minimum regulatory capital ratios must be maintained by the firm jpmorgan chase also estimates the portfolio effect on required economic capital based on correlations of risk in stress scenarios across risk categories this estimated diversification benefit leads to a reduction in required economic capital for the firm the total required economic capital for jpmorgan chase as determined by its models and after considering the firm’s estimated diversification benefits is then compared with available common stockholders’ equity to evaluate overall capital utilization the firm’s policy is to maintain an appropriate level of excess capital to provide for growth and additional protection against losses the 2002 excess capital position was slightly higher than in 2001 the increase was primarily due to a decline in private equity risk capital due to the lower carrying value of the portfolio partially offset by increases in credit risk capital and goodwillintangibles capital at chase financial services principally as a result of the acquisition of the providian master trust internal capital allocations may change from time to time to reflect refinements of economic capital methodologies for 2003 the firm is revising its capital measurement methodologies for commercial credit risk and operating risk these changes are discussed on pages 57 and 64 regulatory capital jpmorgan chase’s primary federal banking regulator the board of governors of the federal reserve system “federal reserve board” establishes capital requirements including wellcapitalized standards and leverage ratios for the consolidated financial holding company and its statechartered banks including jpmorgan chase bank the office of the comptroller of the currency establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the firm’s national bank subsidiaries including chase manhattan bank usa na as of december 31 2002 the financial holding company and its banking subsidiaries maintained capital levels well in excess of the minimum capital requirements currently the firm targets a tier 1 capital ratio of 8 to 825 the capital committee reviews the firm’s capital targets and policies regularly in light of changing economic conditions and business needs additional information regarding the firm’s capital ratios and a more detailed discussion of federal regulatory capital standards are presented in note 26 on pages 99 and 100 dividends dividends declared in any quarter will be determined by jpmorgan chase’s board of directors the board of directors expressed its intent on september 17 2002 to continue the current dividend level provided that capital ratios remain strong and earnings prospects exceed the current dividend    management’s

liquidity management in managing liquidity management considers a variety of liquidity risk measures as well as market conditions prevailing interest rates liquidity needs and the desired maturity profile of its liabilities overview liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the firm’s activities and in the management of its assets and liabilities jpmorgan chase recognizes the importance of sound liquidity management as a key factor in maintaining strong credit ratings and utilizes a liquidity framework intended to maximize liquidity access and minimize funding costs active liquidity management seeks to ensure that the firm will be able to replace maturing obligations when due and fund its assets at appropriate maturities and rates in all market environments liquidity management framework the capital committee sets the overall liquidity policy for the firm and reviews the contingency funding plan in addition the capital committee provides oversight of the firm’s exposure to specialpurpose entities “spes” with particular focus on potential liquidity support requirements that the firm may have to those spes the liquidity risk committee reporting to the capital committee meets monthly to identify and monitor liquidity issues provide policy guidance oversee adherence and maintain an evolving contingency plan jpmorgan chase utilizes liquidity monitoring tools to maintain appropriate levels of liquidity through normal and stress periods the firm’s liquidity analytics rely on management’s judgment about jpmorgan chase’s ability to liquidate assets or use them as collateral for borrowings these analytics also involve estimates and assumptions taking into account credit risk management’s historical data on the funding of loan commitments eg commercial paper backup facilities liquidity commitments to spes commitments with rating triggers and collateralposting requirements for a further discussion on spes and other offbalance sheet arrangements see offbalance sheet arrangements on page 44 as well as note 11 on pages 83–87 the firm’s three primary measures of liquidity are  each of the firm’s liquidity surplus positions as of december 31 2002 indicates that jpmorgan chase’s longdated funding including core deposits exceeds illiquid assets and that the firm’s obligations can be met if access to funding is temporarily impaired an extension of the firm’s ongoing liquidity management is its contingency funding plan which is intended to help the firm manage through liquidity stress periods the plan considers temporary and longterm stress scenarios and forecasts potential funding needs where access to unsecured funding is severely limited or nonexistent these scenarios take into account both on and offbalance sheet exposures evaluating access to funds by the parent holding company jpmorgan chase bank and chase manhattan bank usa na separately funding credit ratings jpmorgan chase’s parent holding company and jpmorgan chase bank’s credit ratings as of december 31 2002 were as follows  as of february 28 2003 the ratings outlook for the parent holding company by moody’s investor services “moody’s” was stable and the ratings outlook for the parent holding company by standard  poor’s “sp” and fitch inc “fitch” was negative the cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit ratings during 2002 sp moody’s and fitch lowered the debt ratings of jpmorgan chase’s parent holding company and its subsidiaries one notch to the levels noted above this resulted in an increase in the marginal cost of longterm wholesale funds to the parent holding company jpmorgan chase bank’s cost of shortterm funds has not been materially affected by the downgrade although certain counterparties and investors have reduced limits and maturities of exposure to the firm as a result of these actions the financial impact of the ratings downgrade on the firm has not been material see page 44 52 and note 11 on page 86 for further information about the implications of a ratings downgrade for the firm    balance sheet the firm’s total assets increased to 759 billion at december 31 2002 from 694 billion at december 31 2001 auto financing and residential consumer loans increased on higher originations offset by increased loan securitizations commercial loans declined reflecting weaker loan demand and the firm’s ongoing efforts to reduce commercial exposures increases in debt and equity trading assets and investment security assets were driven by increased trading and hedging activity derivative receivables increased primarily as a result of the decline in interest rates growth in trading assets and investment securities was financed primarily by increases in repurchase agreements trading liabilities and deposits sources of funds the diversity of the firm’s funding sources enhances flexibility and limits dependence on any one source of funds while minimizing the cost of funds jpmorgan chase has access to funding markets across the globe and leverages a broad investor base liquidity is generated using a variety of both shortterm and longterm instruments including deposits federal funds purchased repurchase agreements commercial paper bank notes medium and longterm debt capital securities and stockholders’ equity during the year the firm extended its liability maturity profile while reducing reliance on shorterdated wholesale funding instruments eg federal funds purchased and commercial paper a major source of liquidity for jpmorgan chase bank is provided by its large core deposit base core deposits include all us deposits except noninterestbearing time deposits and certificates of deposit of 100000 or more in addition to core deposits the firm benefits from substantial stable deposit balances originated by tss through the normal course of its business additional funding flexibility is provided by the firm’s ability to access the repurchase and asset securitization markets these alternatives are evaluated on an ongoing basis to achieve the appropriate balance of secured and unsecured funding the ability to securitize loans and the associated gains on those securitizations are principally dependent on the credit quality and yields on the assets securitized and are generally not dependent on the ratings of the issuing entity transactions between the firm and its securitization structures are reflected in jpmorgan chase’s financial statements these relationships include retained interests in securitization trusts derivative transactions and liquidity facilities for further details see notes 11 and 29 issuance corporate credit spreads widened in 2002 across industries and sectors driven by headline risk increased investmentgrade defaults and investor risk aversion jpmorgan chase’s credit spreads increased relative to peer commercial bank spreads but remained comparable with peer investment bank spreads consistent with the policy discussed earlier in this section the firm maintains funding at the holding company sufficient to cover maturing obligations over the next 12 months which requires periodic issuance of longterm debt and capital the firm raised the majority of its liquidity needs earlier in the year before the increase in cost of funding occurred the firm believes that the financial impact from the increased cost of longterm debt to be raised in 2003 will not be material during 2002 jpmorgan chase issued approximately 11 billion of longterm debt and 1 billion of trust preferred capital securities during the year 122 billion of longterm debt matured or was redeemed and 550 million of preferred stock of subsidiary was redeemed in addition the firm securitized approximately 72 billion of residential mortgage loans 94 billion of credit card loans and 34 billion of auto loans resulting in pretax gains on securitizations of 214 million 45 million and 6 million respectively for a further discussion of loan securitizations see note 11 on pages 8387 derivatives are used in liquidity risk management and funding to achieve the firm’s desired interest rate risk profile the firm enters into derivatives contracts to swap fixedrate debt to floatingrate obligations and to swap floatingrate debt to fixedrate obligations derivatives contracts are also used to hedge the variability in interest rates that arises from other floatingrate financial instruments and forecasted transactions such as the rollover of shortterm assets and liabilities    management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co 

offbalance sheet arrangements specialpurpose entities or specialpurpose vehicles “spvs” are an important part of the financial markets providing market liquidity by facilitating investors’ access to specific portfolios of assets and risks spes are not operating entities typically they are set up for a single discrete purpose have a limited life and have no employees the basic spe structure involves a company selling assets to the spe the spe funds the purchase by selling securities to investors to insulate investors from creditors of other entities including the seller of the assets spes can be structured to be bankruptcyremote they are critical to the functioning of many investor markets including for example the market for mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities and commercial paper jpmorgan chase is involved with spes in three broad categories of transactions loan securitizations multiseller conduits and client intermediation capital is held as appropriate against all sperelated transactions and exposures such as derivative transactions and lending commitments the firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support an spe transaction and its policies require that transactions with spes be conducted at arms’ length and reflect market pricing consistent with this policy no jpmorgan chase employee is permitted to invest in spes with which the firm is involved where such investment would violate the firm’s worldwide rules of conduct these rules prohibit employees from selfdealing and prohibit employees from acting on behalf of the firm in transactions with which they or their family have any significant financial interest for a further discussion of spes and the firm’s accounting for spes see note 11 on pages 8387 for certain liquidity commitments to spes the firm could be required to provide funding if the credit rating of jpmorgan chase bank were downgraded below specific levels primarily a1 p1 and f1 the amount of these liquidity commitments was 486 billion at december 31 2002 355 billion relate to the firm’s multiseller conduits and structured commercial loan vehicles further described in note 11 on page 86 the total commercial paper outstanding for the multiseller conduits and structured commercial loan vehicles was 247 billion at december 31 2002 the remaining 131 billion in commitments relate to vehicles established by third parties if jpmorgan chase bank is required to provide funding under these commitments the firm could be replaced as liquidity provider additionally for the multiseller conduits

103    credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss due to obligor or counterparty default this risk is managed at both the transaction and portfolio levels credit risk management practices are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the risk assessment process credit risk credit risk represents the loss the firm would experience if an obligor or counterparty could not meet its contractual obligations the firm is subject to credit risk in its lending eg loans and lendingrelated commitments and in its derivatives and certain other trading activities the credit risk related to the issuers of the securities used in the firm’s capital market activities is markedtomarket measured and managed through the firm’s market risk management process the credit risks of the consumer and commercial portfolios are markedly different broadly speaking losses on consumer exposures are more predictable less volatile and less cyclical than losses on commercial exposures for the commercial portfolio the actual loss volatility can be much greater over the course of an economic cycle credit risk management practices credit risk management begins with an assessment of the likelihood of default and the risk of loss that could result from an obligor or counterparty default the firm seeks to assess all credit exposures whether on or offbalance sheet these exposures include loans derivative receivables and lendingrelated commitments eg letters of credit and undrawn commitments to extend credit at both the business unit and corporate levels processes in place are intended to ensure that credit risks are accurately assessed properly approved continually monitored and actively managed to measure these risks estimates are made of both expected and unexpected losses for each segment of the portfolio using statistical techniques first offbalance sheet exposures are converted to “onbalance sheet loan equivalent amounts” based on the amount expected to be drawn at the time of default then expected and unexpected losses are calculated expected losses are statisticallybased estimates of credit losses over time anticipated as a result of counterparty default expected losses are used to set riskadjusted credit loss provisions however expected credit losses are not the sole indicators of risk for commercial assets if losses were entirely predictable the expected loss rate could be factored into pricing and covered as a normal and recurring cost of doing business unexpected losses represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the expected level of loss unexpected losses are what create risk and represent the primary focus of credit risk management the responsibility for credit risk management resides with two functions that were integrated in early 2003 credit risk policy and global credit management both are now headed by the senior credit officer who in turn reports to the vice chairman for finance risk management and administration credit risk policy formulates credit policies limits allowance adequacy and guidelines independently from the groups that approve and support the firm’s credit activities this group monitors and assesses risk profiles and risk management processes at multiple levels — individual credits industry groups product groups and entire business segments of the firm credit risk policy is also responsible for managing problem credits credit risk policy works jointly with market risk management to address country risk counterparty risk risk measurement and capital allocation methodologies global credit management has three functions credit risk management corporate banking and the credit portfolio group the first two functions participate in client coverage and are responsible for approving and monitoring all credit exposures experienced credit officers make decisions to extend credit based on an evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness and the type of credit arrangement these officers consider the current and projected financial condition of the counterparty also considered are the covenants collateral and protection available should the credit quality of the counterparty deteriorate after credit is extended credit officers and industry analysts in collaboration with senior business managers monitor the counterparty’s credit quality in addition to ongoing review of counterparty financial data and documentation the credit risk management and corporate banking groups manage the formal client and industrybased portfolio review processes senior credit officers regularly review current and potential exposure and compliance with limits on both individual counterparties and portfolios the credit portfolio group manages the firm’s credit exposures resulting from both traditional lending and derivative trading activities    management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co credit portfolio jpmorgan chase’s managed creditrelated assets including 307 billion of securitized credit cards totaled 330 billion at december 31 2002 an increase of 7 over yearend 2001 the growth reflects a 16 increase in managed consumer loans offset by a 13 decline in commercial loans and a 17 increase in derivative receivables at december 31 2002 managed consumer loans represented 47 of total managed creditrelated assets compared with 43 at december 31 2001 the following table presents a summary of managed creditrelated information for the dates indicated   nanot applicable    commercial portfolio management of commercial credit risk begins with the individual client selection and evaluation process the firm monitors and evaluates industry risk profiles globally exposures in industries deemed to have increasing risk are more closely managed both individually and in the aggregate the firm’s global strategy particularly in emerging markets is to focus on large leading firms with crossborder financing needs concentration management continues to be key in managing commercial credit risk from the perspective of aggregate portfolio risk management concentration management is addressed partly by the firm’s established strategy of loan origination for distribution and partly by the purchase of credit protection through credit derivatives and secondary market loan sales the firm manages concentrations by obligor risk rating industry product and geography as a result of a particularly difficult credit environment in 2002 the firm placed increased emphasis on the management and further reduction of industry and singlename concentrations the firm established an exposure and capital threshold review process for singlename concentrations and enhanced its procedures to reduce singlename and industry concentrations the firm will continue to refine these credit risk management processes in 2003 the firm’s business strategy for its commercial portfolio remains one of origination for distribution primarily for large corporate obligors the majority of the firm’s wholesale loan originations in ib continue to be distributed into the marketplace with residual holds by the firm averaging less than 10 the commercial loan portfolio declined 13 in 2002 reflecting a combination of continued weak loan demand and chargeoffs as well as the firm’s ongoing goal of reducing commercial credit exposure in addition the firm’s sva discipline discourages the retention of loan assets that do not generate a positive return above the cost of riskadjusted capital sva remains a critical discipline in making loans and commitments particularly when combined with other credit and capital management disciplines markets for traditional credit products have become more liquid with increased opportunities for risk management using credit derivatives and secondary market loan sales the firm will begin in 2003 to derive more of its assessment of credit risk capital from these marketbased parameters which will in turn affect sva see the discussion on capital allocation on page 57 total commercial exposure loans derivatives and unfunded lendingrelated commitments was 413 billion at december 31 2002 compared with 424 billion at december 31 2001 at yearend 2002 80 of the firm’s commercial credit exposure was considered investmentgrade only 1 of the total commercial credit exposure was nonperforming this compares with 77 investmentgrade exposure at yearend 2001 08 of the total commercial credit exposure was nonperforming at that date total commercial nonperforming assets were 41 billion at december 31 2002 which included 337 million related to enron this represented an increase of 772 million from yearend 2001 and equaled 2 of the total commercial creditrelated assets the increase in nonperforming assets in 2002 was largely driven by loans in the telecommunications and related cable and merchant energy and related sectors nonperforming assets related to enron declined by 936 million primarily as a result of the settlement of the firm’s litigation with the surety providers commercial loan net chargeoffs in 2002 were 19 billion compared with 10 billion in 2001 chargeoffs of commercial lendingrelated commitments were 212 million in 2002 compared with a net recovery of 3 million in 2001 the chargeoff ratio for commercial loans was 193 in 2002 and 087 in 2001 while the economic and associated credit environments are expected to remain challenging in 2003 the firm does not anticipate commercial chargeoffs in 2003 to reach 2002 levels below are summaries of

aggregate 68 billion or 41 of total criticized exposure but only 16 of total commercial credit exposure the balance of the criticized exposure represented exposures diversified across a large number of customers with limited industry concentration enronrelated exposure the firm’s exposure to enron and enronrelated entities was reduced by 138 billion during 2002 from 206 billion at december 31 2001 to 688 million at december 31 2002 in january 2003 the firm settled its suretybond litigation with 11 insurance companies for 60 of the principal amount of the bonds and received a cash payment of 502 million and unsecured claims valued at 75 million or 13 of face value in connection with the settlement the firm charged off an aggregate 395 million relating to the remaining exposure on the prepaid forward contracts and on a prepaid forward contract that is backed by a letter of credit that is the subject of continuing litigation the firm has reclassified the remaining value of the derivative contracts covered by the surety bonds and the 75 million in unsecured claims as trading assets in addition to these writedowns and chargeoffs during 2002 76 million of other enronrelated exposure was chargedoff or writtendown and 402 million of enronrelated assets were sold or matured including 125 million of debtorinpossession financing exposure which matured without being drawn at december 31 2002 the firm’s enronrelated exposure was as follows enronrelated exposure a   of the 131 million in lendingrelated commitments 125 million relates to debtorinpossession financing the 108 million in other assets relates to the enronrelated letter of credit that is the subject of litigation trading assets both performing and nonperforming are carried at fair value secured loans are performing and are reported on an amortized cost basis all unsecured amounts are nonperforming nonperforming loans have been written down to reflect management’s estimate of current recoverable value and nonperforming other assets are being carried at their current estimated realizable value in accordance with sfas 5 derivative contracts in the normal course of business the firm utilizes derivative instruments to meet the needs of customers generate revenues through trading activities manage exposure to fluctuations in interest and currency rates and manage its own credit risk the firm uses the same credit risk management procedures to assess and approve potential credit exposures when entering into derivative transactions as those used for traditional lending the following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts and derivative receivables ie the marktomarket or fair value of the derivative contract after taking into account the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements at each of the dates indicated notional amounts and derivative receivables        the 26 trillion of notional principal of the firm’s derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2002 significantly exceeds the possible credit losses that could arise from such transactions for most derivative transactions the notional principal amount does not change hands it is simply used as a reference to calculate payments in terms of current credit risk exposure the appropriate measure of risk is the marktomarket “mtm” value of the contract the mtm exposure represents the cost to replace the contracts at current market rates should the counterparty default when jpmorgan chase has more than one transaction outstanding with a counterparty and a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists with the counterparty the net mtm exposure less collateral held represents in the firm’s view the appropriate measure of current credit risk with that counterparty as of the reporting date at december 31 2002 the mtm value of derivatives receivables after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements was 83 billion further after taking into account 30 billion of collateral held by the firm the net current credit exposure was 53 billion while useful as a current view of credit exposure the net mtm value of the derivatives receivable does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure the firm measures on a clientbyclient basis both the worstcase or peak future credit risk at a 975 confidence level as well as the expected credit risk however the total potential future credit risk embedded in the firm’s derivatives portfolio is not the simple sum of all peak or expected client credit risks this is because at the portfolio level credit risk is reduced by the fact that when offsetting transactions are done with separate counterparties only one of the two trades can generate a credit loss even if both counterparties were to default simultaneously the firm refers to this effect as market diversification the firm defines the “marketdiversified peak” as the maximum loss estimated at the 975 confidence level that would occur if all counterparties were to default over a oneyear time horizon without any recovery the marketdiversified peak after taking into account both collateral and netting was approximately 57 billion at december 31 2002 since generally all counterparties will not default at once nor all default when their exposures are at peak levels this is a conservative measure in the firm’s view of its potential future derivatives credit risk the mtm value of the firm’s derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment to reflect the credit quality of counterparties this is called the credit valuation adjustment “cva” and was 13 billion as of december 31 2002 compared with 12 billion at december 31 2001 the cva is based on the expected future exposure incorporating netting and collateral to a counterparty and on the counterparty’s credit spread in the credit derivatives market the primary components of changes in cva are credit spreads new deal activity deal unwinds and changes in the interest rate equity foreign exchange or commodity environment the cva increase in 2002 was primarily due to derivative receivables which increased as a result of a drop in us interest rates increased interest rate volatility and widening of credit spreads during the year the firm believes that dynamic risk management is essential to controlling the credit risk in the derivatives portfolio the firm hedges components of the cva change by entering into credit derivative transactions as well as interest rate foreign exchange equity and commodity derivatives transactions when client deals are originated these hedges are rebalanced as market conditions dictate driven primarily by changes in the counterparties’ credit quality if counterparty credit risk increases the cva increases to reflect the increased likelihood that the client will not perform correspondingly the required market hedges to protect against subsequent creditquality deterioration increase the net impact of the change in cva plus the result of all forms of related hedging activity is accounted for in trading revenue and was not material to the overall trading results of the firm for the year at december 31 2002 52 of the firm’s counterparties in derivative transactions were investmentgrade financial institutions most of which are dealers in these products the investmentgrade portion of the derivative receivables was 87 at december 31 2002 nonperforming derivative receivables at december 31 2002 were 289 million compared with 13 billion at december 31 2001 this decrease of 10 billion primarily related to the settlement of the enron surety litigation      management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co the table below summarizes the risk profile as of december 31 2002 of the firm’s balance sheet exposure to derivative contracts net of cash and other highly liquid collateral   approximately twothirds of the firm’s derivatives transactions have associated collateral agreements and collateralization as a primary form of credit risk mitigation continues to increase the firm held 30 billion of collateral as of december 31 2002 compared with 20 billion as of december 31 2001 the firm posted 19 billion of collateral at yearend 2002 compared with 11 billion at the end of 2001 the increases were driven largely by the drop in us interest rates and by new collateral agreements in addition derivative and collateral agreements include provisions that require both the firm and the counterparty upon specified downgrades in their respective credit ratings to post collateral for the benefit of the other party the impact on required collateral of a singlenotch ratings downgrade to jpmorgan chase bank from its current rating of aa to a would have been an additional 12 billion of collateral as of december 31 2002 the impact of a sixnotch ratings downgrade to jpmorgan chase bank from aa to bbb would have been 37 billion of additional collateral from current levels as of december 31 2002 the amount of additional collateral required upon downgrade moves in tandem with the marktomarket value of the derivatives portfolio and ranged from 26 billion to 38 billion through 2002 related to a sixnotch downgrade as the level of us interest rates changed moreover certain derivatives contracts also provide for termination of the contract generally upon jpmorgan chase bank being downgraded at the thenexisting marktomarket value of the derivative receivables use of credit derivatives the following table presents the notional amounts of credit derivatives protection bought and sold at december 31 2002 credit derivatives activity   jpmorgan chase has limited counterparty exposure as a result of credit derivatives transactions of the 83 billion of total derivative receivables at december 31 2002 approximately 55 billion or 7 was associated with credit derivatives before the benefit of collateral the use of derivatives to manage exposures does not reduce the reported level of assets on the balance sheet or the level of reported offbalance sheet commitments portfolio management activity jpmorgan chase’s commercial credit portfolio is composed of credit exposures to clients arising from both lending and derivatives activities in managing this portfolio singlename and portfolio credit derivatives are purchased by the credit portfolio group to hedge these exposures as of december 31 2002 the notional outstanding of protection purchased via singlename and portfolio credit derivatives was 24 billion and 10 billion respectively the firm also diversifies its exposures by providing ie selling small amounts of credit protection which increases exposure to industries or clients where the firm has little or no clientrelated exposure this activity is not material to the firm’s overall credit exposure and credit protection sold totaled less than 500 million in notional exposure at december 31 2002  jpmorgan chase’s utilization of credit derivatives for its portfolio management activities related to loans and lendingrelated commitments does not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas 133 these derivatives are markedtomarket in trading revenue whereas the loans and lendingrelated commitments being hedged are accounted for on an accrual basis in net interest income this asymmetry in accounting treatment between loans and lendingrelated commitments and the derivatives utilized    in the portfolio management activities causes earnings volatility that is not representative of the true changes in value of the firm’s overall credit exposures the marktomarket treatment of both the firm’s derivatives hedges “short” credit positions and derivatives counterparty exposure “long” credit positions provide some natural offset of each other included in trading revenue are gains of 127 million in 2002 related to credit derivatives that were used to hedge the firm’s credit exposure of the 127 million approximately 94 million was associated with credit derivatives used to hedge accrual lending activities trading revenues incorporate both the cost of hedge premiums and changes in value due to spread movements and credit events dealerclient activity jpmorgan chase’s dealer activity in credit derivatives is clientdriven the business acts as a market maker in singlename credit derivatives and also structures more complex transactions for clients’ investment or risk management purposes the credit derivatives trading function operates within the same framework as other marketmaking desks risk limits are established and closely monitored as of december 31 2002 the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold by the dealer business were 159 billion and 172 billion respectively the mismatch between these notional amounts is attributable to the firm selling protection on large diversified predominantly investmentgrade portfolios including the most senior tranches and then hedging these positions by buying protection on the more subordinated tranches of the same portfolios in addition the firm may use securities to hedge certain derivative positions consequently while there is a mismatch in notional amounts of credit derivatives the risk positions are largely matched the amount of credit risk contributed by the firm’s credit derivatives dealer activity is immaterial in the context of jpmorgan chase’s overall credit exposures country exposure the firm has a comprehensive process for measuring and managing its country exposures and risk exposures to a country include all creditrelated lending trading and investment activities whether crossborder or locally funded the table below presents jpmorgan chase’s exposure to selected countries this disclosure is based on management’s view of country exposure exposure amounts are adjusted for credit enhancements eg guarantees and letters of credit provided by third parties located outside the country if the enhancements fully cover the country risk as well as the commercial risk total exposure includes exposure to both government and privatesector entities in a country while exposure to mexico fluctuates as a result of trading activities the decrease over the prior year was primarily due to loan maturities and reductions in counterparty exposure on derivatives the decrease in exposure to brazil over the prior yearend was due to reductions in loans and derivative exposures as well as reductions in local government trading positions reductions in argentina were due to a combination of maturities and writedowns exposure to venezuela increased modestly as a result of trading positions selected country exposure      management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co consumer portfolio consumer credit risk management uses sophisticated portfolio modeling credit scoring and decisionsupport tools to project credit risks and establish underwriting standards risk parameters are established in the early stages of product development and the cost of credit risk is an integral part of product pricing and evaluating profit dynamics consumer portfolios are monitored to identify deviations from expected performance and shifts in patterns of consumer behavior jpmorgan chase’s consumer portfolio consists primarily of mortgages credit cards and auto financings this portfolio is predominantly usbased and continues to be geographically welldiversified the firm’s managed consumer portfolio totaled 156 billion at december 31 2002 an increase of 22 billion or 16 from 2001 the pie graph to the right provides a summary of the consumer portfolio by loan type at yearend 2002 and each loan type’s chargeoff rate the firm’s largest component residential mortgage loans comprised 41 of the total consumer portfolio and is primarily secured by first mortgages  the following table presents managed consumer creditrelated information for the dates indicated     

  

   loans for 1—4 family residential mortgages increased 8 during 2002 on increased originations while net chargeoffs for 2002 increased 6 million or 12 over the prior year the 2002 net chargeoff rate remained low at 010 reflecting the continued strong credit quality of the portfolio at december 31 2002 the firm had 18 billion of subprime residential mortgage loans of which 13 billion were held for sale the firm analyzes its credit card portfolio on a “managed” basis which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet and those that have been securitized managed credit card receivables increased by 96 billion or 23 during 2002 approximately 69 billion of this growth arose from the acquisition of the providian master trust in february 2002 the managed net chargeoff ratio of 587 was 42 basis points higher than in 2001 the increase in the net chargeoff rate was a result of higher consumer bankruptcy levels as well as higher contractual losses ie losses on accounts not bankrupt due in large part to the credit characteristics of the providian portfolio these losses were therefore anticipated at the time of the portfolio acquisition auto finance receivables grew by 31 to approximately 34 billion while the net chargeoff rate improved slightly from 059 to 057 in 2002 in the consumer sector the firm currently anticipates higher chargeoffs in 2003 resulting from increases in loans outstanding chargeoff rates are anticipated to be similar to those experienced in 2002  consumer loans by geographic region a      management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co allowance for credit losses jpmorgan chase’s allowance for credit losses is intended to cover probable credit losses including those in which the asset is not specifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined at least quarterly the firm’s risk management committee reviews the allowance for credit losses relative to the risk profile of the firm’s credit portfolio and current economic conditions the allowance is adjusted based on that review if in management’s judgment changes are warranted the allowance includes specific and expected loss components and a residual component for further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses see critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages 65–66 and note 10 on page 82 at december 31 2002 management deemed the allowance for credit losses to be adequate to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yet identifiable loans the commercial specific loss component of the allowance was 160 billion at december 31 2002 an increase of 547 million or 52 from yearend 2001 the increase was primarily attributable to the deterioration in commercial loans related to the telecommunications and related industries and cable sectors which led to an increase in criticized and nonperforming loans the commercial expected loss component of the allowance was 613 million at december 31 2002 a decrease of 55 million or 8 from yearend 2001 the decrease reflected a reduction in the amount and an improvement in the average quality of the noncriticized portion of the loan portfolio the consumer expected loss component of the allowance was 236 billion at december 31 2002 an increase of 255 million or 12 from yearend 2001 the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the providian portfolio by cardmember services this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of retained credit card loans excluding those in the providian portfolio and a reduction in expected loss rates in the auto finance portfolio as a result of improved delinquency rates the residual component of the allowance was 774 million at december 31 2002 an increase of 79 million or 11 from yearend 2001 management views the residual component as necessary to address uncertainties at december 31 2002 primarily in the commercial portfolio at december 31 2002 the residual component represented approximately 14 of the total allowance for loan losses within the firm’s target range of between 10 and 20 summary of changes in the allowance   credit costs     lendingrelated commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in the creditextension process management also computes specific and expected loss components as well as a residual component for lendingrelated commitments this is computed using a methodology similar to that used for the loan portfolio modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown the allowance increased due to deterioration in the criticized portion of the firm’s lendingrelated commitments in 2002 the firm chargedoff 212 million of a lendingrelated commitment to one obligor in the telecommunications and related industry segment capital allocation for credit risk unexpected credit losses drive the allocation of credit risk capital by portfolio segment in the commercial portfolio capital allocations are differentiated by risk rating loss severity maturity and correlations within the consumer businesses capital allocations are differentiated by product and by product segment for the commercial portfolio the firm in 2003 will begin aligning its assessment of credit risk capital to correspond more closely to market conditions both at the time of the credit extension and on an ongoing basis this is intended to facilitate risk management by taking advantage of the growing market in credit derivatives and secondary market loan sales and to encourage earlier action in the event of market deterioration in determining the amount of credit risk capital that should be associated with credit exposures the firm will emphasize current marketbased estimates of default likelihood and credit deterioration implied from credit spreads and equity prices rather than historical averages concurrently the firm will assess the valuation impact of credit deterioration as well as anticipated losses associated with default depending on market conditions the assessment of credit risk capital is expected to vary with changes in credit spreads in the market the new methodology is expected to increase the amount of credit risk capital allocated to the commercial portfolio this expected increase in credit risk capital will be partially offset by methodology changes to operating risk capital see the discussion on capital allocation for operational and business risk on page 64 the firm will also continue to refine in 2003 its processes for establishing credit exposure limits for industry and singlename concentrations including investmentgrade obligors for the consumer portfolio consumer products are placed into categories with homogenous credit characteristics from which default rates and chargeoffs can be estimated the credit risk capital to be allocated is based on the unexpected loss inherent in those segments    management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co market risk management market risk represents the potential loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments caused by movements in market variables such as interest and foreignexchange rates credit spreads and equity and commodity prices jpmorgan chase employs comprehensive rigorous processes intended to measure monitor and control market risk risk management processes market risk management is an independent corporate governance function that identifies measures monitors and controls market risk it seeks to facilitate efficient riskreturn decisions and to reduce volatility in operating performance by making the firm’s market risk profile transparent to senior management the board of directors and regulators market risk management reports to the vice chairman for finance risk management and administration within the group individual coverage teams are assigned to particular businesses and have expertise in the types of risk specific to those businesses each team is responsible for measuring monitoring and controlling market risk for its business in addition to the coverage teams two groups are managed under a joint mandate with credit risk policy one group is responsible for country risk and counterparty risk the second group develops the methodologies for measuring risk and allocating market and credit risk capital throughout the firm finally the policy reporting and analysis group within market risk management is responsible for developing the policies that control the market risk management processes and for aggregating interpreting and distributing market riskrelated information throughout the firm there are other groups reporting to the vice chairman with some responsibility for managing market risk for example within the finance area the valuation control group is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the valuations of all positions taken within ib management of market risk is not however confined to a central organization business units are expected to maintain strong risk discipline at all levels trading businesses for example have functions that act independently from trading personnel and are responsible for verifying risk exposures taken within their businesses in addition businesses are expected to report exposures which may be unusually large or may not fit existing risk measurement methodologies risk measurement because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk the firm uses several measures both statistical and nonstatistical including     valueatrisk jpmorgan chase’s statistical risk measure var gauges the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment and provides a consistent crossbusiness measure of risk profiles and levels of risk diversification var is used to compare risks across businesses to monitor limits and to allocate economic capital in a normal trading environment var provides risk transparency to senior management business heads regulators and investors each business day the firm undertakes a comprehensive var calculation that includes its trading investment and assetliability “al” management activities jpmorgan chase’s var calculation is highly granular comprising more than 500000 positions and 200000 pricing series eg securities prices interest rates foreignexchange rates for a large portion of its exposure the firm has implemented fullrevaluation var which management believes generates more accurate results to calculate var the firm uses historical simulation which measures risk across instruments and portfolios in a consistent comparable way this approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of future changes the simulation is based on data for the previous 12 months key terms     all statistical models involve a degree of uncertainty depending on the assumptions they employ the firm prefers historical simulation because it involves fewer assumptions about the distribution of portfolio losses than parameterbased methodologies in addition the firm regularly assesses the quality of the market data since their accuracy is critical to computing var nevertheless to the extent that var is largely based on historical market data it may not accurately reflect future risk during environments in which market volatility is changing in addition the var measure on any particular day is not indicative of future risk levels since positions and market conditions may both change over time aggregate portfolio   the firm calculated the var numbers reported above using a oneday time horizon and a 99 confidence level this means the firm would expect to incur losses greater than predicted by var estimates only once in every 100 trading days or about 25 times a year in 2002 there were no days on which actual firmwide market riskrelated losses exceeded corporate var a result which does not differ significantly from the 99 confidence level although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk the table above provides a meaningful overview of the firm’s market risk exposure arising from trading activities and the investment and al portfolios vars for the investment portfolio and al activities measure the amount of potential change in their economic value however they are not measures of reported revenues since those activities are not markedtomarket through earnings the daily average trading var for the 12 months of 2002 was 716 million the largest contributor was interest rate risk which includes credit spread risk before portfolio diversification interest rate risk accounted for roughly twothirds of the average var the diversification effect which averaged 289 million in 2002 reflects the fact that the largest losses for different positions and risks do not typically occur at the same time the risk of a portfolio of positions is therefore usually less than the sum of the risks of the positions themselves the degree of diversification is determined both by the extent to which different market variables tend to move together and by the extent to which different businesses have similar positions the reduction in trading var between yearend 2002 and 2001 was driven primarily by declines in market volatilities particularly in interest rates and energy prices in general over the course of a year var exposures can vary significantly as trading positions change and market volatility fluctuates the histogram on the following page illustrates the firm’s daily market riskrelated revenue defined as the daily change in value of the marktomarket trading portfolios plus any tradingrelated net interest income brokerage commissions underwriting fees or other revenue the chart shows that the firm posted positive daily market riskrelated revenue for 226 out of 258 days in 2002 with 63 days exceeding 50 million losses were sustained on 32 of the 258 days 17 of those days were in the third quarter poor overall trading results in that quarter accounted for the losses during those 17 days no daily trading loss during the year was in excess of 64 million    management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co the average daily market riskrelated revenue during 2002 was 312 million the weakest performance occurred during the third quarter when it averaged 180 million this lower revenue was not due to generally increased risk taken during the quarter but rather reflected the outcome of specific positioning decisions performance improved during the fourth quarter as average daily market riskrelated revenue increased to 336 million while the average var remained slightly below the average for all of 2002 thus the improvement in market riskrelated revenues during the fourth quarter was not accompanied by an overall increase in the level of risk taken to evaluate the soundness of its var model the firm conducts daily backtesting of var against actual financial results based on daily market riskrelated revenue the firm’s definition of market riskrelated revenue is consistent with the federal reserve board’s implementation of the basle committee’s market risk capital rules the federal reserve board’s guidelines state that such revenue typically includes fee income and commissions associated with trading activities in addition to realized and unrealized gains and losses on portfolio positions the inset examines the 32 days on which jpmorgan chase posted trading losses and depicts the amount by which var was greater than the actual loss on each day no losses exceeded var on any of these days a performance statistically consistent with the firm’s 99 confidence level stress testing while var reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets stress testing captures the firm’s exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets stress testing is equally important as var in measuring and controlling risk stress testing enhances the understanding of the firm’s risk profile and loss potential and is used for limits monitoring crossbusiness risk measurement and economic capital allocation the firm stress tests its portfolios at least once a month at both the corporate and business segment levels using multiple scenarios scenarios are continually reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the firm’s risk profile and economic events stress results trends and explanations are provided each month to the firm’s senior management to help them better measure and manage risks to understand event risksensitive positions applying economicvalue stress tests to the trading and investment portfolios and al activities helps the firm understand how the economic value of its balance sheet not the amounts reported under gaap would change under certain scenarios    the following table represents the potential economic value stresstest loss pretax in jpmorgan chase’s trading portfolio predicted by jpmorgan chase’s stresstest scenarios largest monthly stresstest loss — pretax  the firm’s stresstest methodology assumes that during an actual stress event no action would be taken to change the risk profile of portfolios this captures the decreased liquidity that often occurs with abnormal markets and results in the firm’s view in a conservative stresstest result economicvalue stress tests are performed at varying dates each month the stress results at december 5 2002 were mostly driven by exposures sensitive to a stress scenario where credit spreads widen significantly and at the same time equity prices decline and interest rates fall in the major currencies var results cannot be directly correlated to stresstest loss results for three reasons first stresstest losses are calculated at varying dates each month while var is performed daily and reported for the periodend date second var and stress tests are two distinct risk measurements yielding very different loss potentials thus although the same trading portfolios are used for both tests var is based on a distribution of oneday historical losses measured over the most recent one year in contrast stress testing subjects the portfolio to more extreme larger moves over a longer time horizon eg 23 weeks third as var and stress tests are distinct risk measurements the impact of portfolio diversification can vary greatly for var markets can change in patterns over a oneyear time horizon moving from highly correlated to less so in stress testing the focus is on a single event and the associated correlations in an extreme market situation as a result while var over a given time horizon can be lowered by a diversification benefit in the portfolio this benefit would not necessarily manifest itself in stresstest scenarios which assume large coherent moves across all markets the firm conducts both economicvalue and nii stress tests on its investment portfolios and al activities which are not accounted for on a trading basis economicvalue stress tests measure the potential change in the value of these portfolios under the same scenarios used to evaluate the trading portfolios the largest potential stresstest loss of these portfolios as of december 5 2002 is under a scenario that assumes a sharp widening in credit spreads and decreases in interest rates if the wholesale loan portfolio is excluded the largest potential stresstest loss is associated with a scenario that assumes a smaller widening in credit spreads but also assumes significant declines in equity prices and increases in market volatilities at present the economicvalue stress tests do not include consumer loans the value of which is more difficult to relate to external market variables this will be the subject of continued research the more conventional nii stress test measures the potential change in the firm’s nii over the next year these stress tests highlight exposures to various interest ratesensitive factors such as rates eg the primelending rate pricing strategies on deposits and changes in product mix nii stress tests also take into account forecasted balance sheet changes such as asset sales and securitizations as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior at yearend 2002 jpmorgan chase’s largest potential nii stress loss was estimated at 277 million primarily the result of potential compression in deposit spreads associated with further rate declines from the current lowrate environment other statistical and nonstatistical risk measures in addition to var jpmorgan chase employs the risk identification for large exposures “rifle” methodology as another statistical risk measure the firm requires that all market risktaking businesses self assess their risks to unusual and specific events individuals who manage risk positions particularly complex positions identify potential “worstcase” losses that could arise from an unusual or specific event such as a potential tax change and estimate the probabilities of such losses through the firm’s rifle system this information is then directed to the appropriate level of management thereby permitting the firm to identify further earnings vulnerabilities not adequately covered by var and stress testing nonstatistical risk measures other than stress testing include net open positions basis point values option sensitivities position concentrations and position turnover these measures provide additional information on an exposure’s size and the direction in which it is moving nonstatistical measures are used for limit monitoring oneoff approvals and tactical control capital allocation for market risk the firm allocates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the extent to which risks are present in businesses daily var monthly stress results and other factors determine appropriate capital charges for major business lines the var measure captures a large number of oneday price moves while stress tests capture a smaller number of very large price moves the firm allocates market risk capital to each division according to a formula that weights that division’s var and stresstest exposures    management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co risk monitoring and control limits the firm controls market risk primarily through a series of limits the sizes of limits reflect the firm’s risk appetite after extensive analyses of the market environment and business strategy the analyses examine factors such as market volatility product liquidity business track record and management experience and depth the firm maintains different levels of limits corporatelevel limits encompass var calculations and stresstest loss advisories similarly business segment levels include limits on var calculations nonstatistical measurements and pl loss advisories businesses are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported daily exceeded limits are reported immediately to senior management and the affected business unit must take appropriate action to reduce trading positions if the business cannot do this within an acceptable timeframe senior management is consulted on the appropriate action market risk management regularly reviews and updates risk limits and the firm’s risk management committee reviews and approves the risk limits at least twice a year market risk management further controls the firm’s exposure by specifically designating approved financial instruments for each business unit qualitative risk assessment the firm’s market risk management group also performs periodic reviews of both businesses and products with exposure to market risk in order to assess the ability of the businesses to control market risk the business management’s strategy market conditions product details and effectiveness of risk controls are reviewed specific recommendations for improvements are made to management model review many of the firm’s financial instruments cannot be valued based on quoted market prices but are instead valued using pricing models such models are used for management of risk positions such as reporting risk against limits as well as for valuation the firm reviews the models it uses to assess model appropriateness and consistency across businesses the model reviews consider a number of issues appropriateness of the model assessing the extent to which it accurately reflects the characteristics of the transaction and captures its significant risks independence and reliability of data sources appropriateness and adequacy of numerical algorithms and sensitivity to input parameters or other assumptions which cannot be priced from the market reviews are conducted for new or changed models as well as previously accepted models rereviews assess whether there have been any material changes to the accepted models whether there have been any changes in the product or market that may impact the validity of the model and whether there have been new theoretical or competitive developments that may require a reassessment of the model’s adequacy for a summary of valuations based on models see critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages 6567 policies and procedures jpmorgan chase maintains policies and procedures surrounding market risk management practices the goal is to specify a clear set of objectives responsibilities and procedures throughout the market risk management infrastructure to produce a consistent approach to risk measurement monitoring and control across business lines    operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems human factors or external events  overview operational risk is inherent in each of the firm’s businesses and support activities operational risk can manifest itself in various ways including errors business interruptions inappropriate behavior of employees and vendors not performing in accordance with outsourcing arrangements these events can potentially result in financial losses and other damage to the firm including causing it reputational harm to monitor and control operational risk the firm maintains a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to provide a sound and wellcontrolled operational environment the goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the firm’s financial strength the characteristics of its businesses the markets in which it operates and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject notwithstanding these control measures the firm incurs operational losses the firm’s approach to operational risk management is intended to mitigate such losses operational risk management practices        operational risk management practices throughout 2002 the firm continued to execute a multiyear plan begun in 2001 for an integrated approach that emphasizes active management of operational risk throughout the firm the objective of this effort is to supplement the traditional controlbased approach to operational risk with risk measures tools and disciplines that are riskspecific consistently applied and utilized firmwide key themes for this effort are transparency of information escalation of key issues and accountability for issue resolution ultimate responsibility for the firm’s operational risk management practices resides with the vice chairman for finance risk management and administration the components are governance structure the governance structure provides the framework for the firm’s operational risk management activities primary responsibility for managing operational risk rests with business managers these individuals are responsible for establishing and maintaining appropriate internal control procedures for their respective businesses the operational risk committee is comprised of senior operational risk and finance managers from each of the businesses this committee meets quarterly to discuss key operational risk issues of importance to the firm in addition each of the businesses must maintain business control committees to oversee their operational risk management practices selfassessment process in 2002 the firm continued to refine its firmwide selfassessment process the focus of the process is for each business to identify the key operational risks specific to its environment and assess the degree to which it is maintaining appropriate controls action plans are developed for control issues identified and businesses are held accountable for tracking and resolving these issues on a timely basis selfassessments are completed by the businesses utilizing horizon a software application developed by the firm with the aid of horizon the firm moved in 2002 from an annual yearend selfassessment process to one performed semiannually going forward the firm plans to utilize this selfassessment process as an ongoing dynamic risk management tool operational riskevent monitoring the firm has a process for reporting operational riskevent data permitting analyses of errors and losses as well as trends such analyses performed both at a lineofbusiness level and by riskevent type enables identification of root causes associated with risk events faced by the businesses where available the internal data can be supplemented with external data for comparative analysis with industry patterns the data reported will also enable the firm to backtest against selfassessment results audit alignment in addition to conducting independent internal audits the firm’s internal audit department has provided guidance on the design and implementation of the operational risk framework this guidance has helped further the firmwide    management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co implementation of the framework which in turn has led to a stronger overall control environment the department utilizes output such as business selfassessment results to help focus allocation of its resources thereby maximizing the efficiencies of its internal audit responsibilities the department also reviews the effectiveness and accuracy of the selfassessment process during the conduct of audits capital allocation for operational and business risk historically a combined capital amount for operational risk and business risk collectively referred to as “operating risk” capital was derived through topdown benchmarking by business against comparable financial institutions in 2003 a new riskbased capital allocation methodology will replace the existing approach the new methodology will separate operating risk capital into its two discrete components operational risk and business risk the new approach will estimate these risks independently and allocate capital to each component it is estimated that this new approach will result in a lower amount of capital than previously calculated operational risk the new operational risk capital model is lossbased with adjustments to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment and with a potential offset for the use of risktransfer products the firm believes that the model will be consistent with the proposed basle ii accord and expects to propose it eventually for qualification under the advanced measurement approach for operational risk business risk business risk capital represents the risk associated with the volatility in the firm’s earnings due to factors not captured by other parts of the firm’s economic capital framework such volatility can arise from ineffective design or execution of business strategies volatile economic or financial market activity changing client expectations and demands and restructuring to adjust for changes in the competitive environment capital will be allocated to each business based on historical revenue volatility and measures of fixed and variable expenses earnings volatility arising from other risk factors such as credit or market risk will be excluded from the measurement of business risk capital as these factors are captured under those risk capital models reputation risk a firm’s success depends not only on its prudent management of credit market and operational risks but equally on the maintenance of its reputation among many constituents — clients investors regulators as well as the general public — for business practices of the highest quality attention to its reputation has always been a key aspect of the firm’s practices and maintenance of reputation is everyone’s responsibility the firm bolsters this individual responsibility in many ways codes of ethics training policies and oversight functions that approve transactions including a conflicts office to examine transactions with the potential to create conflicts of interest or roles for the firm during 2002 the firm put in place an additional structure to take account of the potential for adverse reputational impact of transactions with clients especially complex derivatives and structured finance transactions the structure reinforces the firm’s procedures for examining transactions in terms of appropriateness ethical issues and reputational risk and intensifies the firm’s scrutiny of the purpose and effect of its transactions from the client’s point of view with the goal that these transactions are not used to deceive investors or others this new structure operates at three levels as part of every business’ transaction approval process review by regional policy review committees and oversight by the policy review office business transaction approval primary responsibility for adherence with the policies and procedures designed to address reputation risk lies with the business units conducting the transactions in question this transaction approval process requires review and signoff from among others internal legalcompliance conflicts tax and accounting policy groups transactions involving an spe established by the firm receive particular scrutiny and must comply with a specialpurpose vehicle policy designed to ensure that every such entity is properly approved documented monitored and controlled regional policy review committees business units are also required to submit to regional policy review committees proposed transactions that may raise reputation risk for any reason — including where applicable intended financial disclosure of the transaction by the client — and the committees approve reject or require further clarification or changes the members of these committees are senior representatives of the business and support units in the region the committees may escalate transaction review to the policy review office policy review office the policy review office is the most senior approval level for client transactions involving reputation issues the mandate of the office is to opine on specific transactions brought by the regional committees and consider changes in policies or practices relating to reputation risk the head of the office consults with the firm’s most senior executives on specific topics and provides regular updates aside from governance and guidance on specific transactions the objective of the policy review process is to reinforce a culture through a “casestudy” approach which ensures that all employees regardless of seniority understand the basic principles of reputation risk control and can recognize and address issues as they arise      private equity risk management risk management jpmorgan partners employs processes for risk measurement and control that are similar to those used for other businesses within the firm the processes are coordinated with the firm’s overall approach to market and concentration risk private equity risk is initially monitored through the use of industry and geographic limits additionally to manage the pace of new investment a ceiling on the amount of annual private equity investment activity has been set jpmorgan partners’ public equity holdings create a significant exposure to general declines in the equity markets to gauge that risk var and stresstest exposures are calculated in the same way as they are for the firm’s trading investment and assetliability management portfolios during the year jpmp management undertook frequent reviews of its public security holdings as part of a disciplined approach to sales and hedging issues hedging programs are very limited but are considered when practical and as circumstances dictate over time the firm may change the nature and type of hedges it enters into as well as close a hedging position altogether capital allocation for private equity risk internal capital is allocated to jpmp’s public equities portfolio based on stress scenarios that are similar to those applied to other businesses and which reflects the potential loss inherent in the portfolio in the event of a large equity market decline capital is also allocated against illiquidity risk which results from the contractual sales restrictions to which some holdings are subject for private equities capital is allocated based on a longterm equity market stress scenario that is consistent with the investment time horizons associated with these holdings for these investments additional capital is allocated against the risk of an unexpectedly large number of writeoffs or writedowns the overall internal capital allocation is approximately 53 of the investments’ carrying value critical accounting estimates used by the firm the firm’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding the results reported the firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets and liabilities the firm has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods including any judgments made are well controlled independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the firm believes its estimates for determining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate the following is a brief description of the firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant management valuation judgments allowance for credit losses jpmorgan chase’s allowance for credit losses covers the commercial and consumer loan portfolios as well as the firm’s portfolio of lendingrelated commitments the allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the value of the firm’s loan assets for probable credit losses as of the balance sheet date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles management also computes an allowance for lendingrelated commitments using a methodology similar to that used for the commercial loan portfolio for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the firm’s allowance for credit losses see note 10 on page 82 commercial loans and lendingrelated commitments the methodology for calculating both allowances involves significant judgment first and foremost it involves the early identification of credits that are deteriorating second it involves management judgment to derive loss factors the firm uses a risk rating system to determine the credit quality of its loans commercial loans are reviewed for information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations in assessing the risk rating of a particular loan among the factors considered include the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility the level of the obligor’s earnings the amount and sources of repayment the level and nature of contingencies management strength and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates these factors are based on an evaluation of historical information as well as subjective assessment and interpretation emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors that may be relevant in determining the risk rating of a particular loan but which are not currently an explicit part of the firm’s methodology could impact the risk rating assigned by the firm to that loan management also applies its judgment to derive loss factors associated with each credit facility these loss factors are determined by facility structure collateral and type of obligor wherever possible the firm uses independent verifiable data or the firm’s own historical loss experience in its models for estimating these loss factors many factors can affect management’s estimates of specific loss and expected loss including volatility of default probabilities rating migrations and loss severity for example judgment is    management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co required to determine how many years of data to include when estimating the possible severity of the loss if a full credit cycle is not captured in the data then estimates may be inaccurate likewise judgment is applied to determine whether the loss severity factor should be calculated as an average over the entire credit cycle or whether to apply the loss severity factor implied at a particular point in the credit cycle the application of different loss severity factors would change the amount of the allowance for credit losses determined appropriate by the firm similarly there are judgments as to which external data on default probabilities should be used and when they should be used choosing data that are not reflective of the firm’s specific loan portfolio characteristics could affect loss estimates as noted above the firm’s allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to a loan assuming for all commercial loans a onenotch downgrade in the firm’s internal risk ratings the allowance for loan losses for commercial loans would increase by approximately 850 million at december 31 2002 this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should be used with caution the purpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impact risk ratings have on the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for commercial loans it is not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration in risk ratings given the process the firm follows in determining risk ratings of its loans management believes the current risk ratings assigned to commercial loans are appropriate and the likelihood of a onenotch downgrade for all commercial loans is remote consumer loans the consumer portfolio is segmented into three main business lines chase home finance chase cardmember services and chase auto finance for each major portfolio segment within each line of business there are three primary factors that are considered in determining the expected loss component of the allowance for loan losses periodend outstandings expected loss factor and average life the various components of these factors such as collateral prepayment rates credit score distributions collections and the historical loss experience of a business segment differ across business lines for example credit card revolving credit has significantly higher chargeoff ratios than fixed mortgage credit determination of each factor is based primarily on statistical data and macroeconomic assumptions residual component management’s judgments are also applied when considering uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic and political conditions the impact of currency devaluation on crossborder exposures changes in underwriting standards unexpected correlations within the portfolio or other factors for example judgment as to political developments in a particular country will affect management’s assessment of potential loss in the credits that have exposure to that country a separate allowance component the residual component is maintained to cover these uncertainties principally at december 31 2002 in the commercial portfolio it is anticipated that the residual component will range between 10 and 20 of the total allowance for credit losses fair value of financial instruments a portion of jpmorgan chase’s assets and liabilities are carried at fair value including trading assets and liabilities afs securities and private equity investments mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of fair value or cost at december 31 2002 approximately 369 billion of the firm’s assets were recorded at fair value fair value is defined as the value at which positions could be closed out or sold in a transaction with a willing and knowledgeable counterparty over a period of time consistent with jpmorgan chase’s trading or investment strategy the majority of the firm’s assets reported at fair value are based on quoted market prices or on internally developed models that are based on independently sourced market parameters including interest rate yield curves option volatilities and currency rates the valuation process takes into consideration factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns and for the derivative portfolio counterparty credit risk see the discussion of cva on page 51 management applies judgment in determining the factors used in the valuation process for example there is often limited market data to rely on when estimating the fair value of a large or aged position similarly judgment must be applied in estimating prices for less readily observable external parameters finally other factors such as model assumptions market dislocations and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded for a particular position trading and availableforsale portfolios substantially all of the firm’s securities held for trading and investment purposes “long” positions and securities that the firm has sold to other parties but does not own “short” positions are valued based on quoted market prices however certain of the securities for example high yield instruments are less actively traded the determination of their fair value requires management judgment as this determination may require benchmarking to similar instruments or analyzing default and recovery rates as few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange the majority of the firm’s derivative positions are valued using internally developed models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters — that is parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources including industrypricing    services certain derivatives however are valued based on models with significant unobservable market parameters — that is parameters that may be estimated and are therefore subject to management judgment to substantiate the model valuation these instruments are less actively traded and could include for example longdated interest rate or currency swaps where swap rates may be unobservable for longer maturities management judgment includes recording fair value adjustments ie reductions to model valuations to account for parameter uncertainty when valuing complex or less actively traded derivative transactions the following table summarizes the firm’s trading and availableforsale portfolios by valuation methodology at december 31 2002   to ensure that the valuations are appropriate the firm has various controls in place these include an independent review and approval of valuation models detailed review and explanation for profit and loss analyzed daily and through time decomposing the model valuations for certain structured derivative instruments into their components and benchmarking valuations where possible to similar products and validating valuation estimates through actual cash settlement as markets and products develop and the pricing for certain derivative products becomes more transparent the firm refines its valuation methodologies the valuation control group within the finance area is responsible for reviewing the accuracy of the valuations of all positions taken within the investment bank for a discussion of market risk management including the model review process see pages 58–62 for a discussion of the developments affecting the accounting for trading derivatives see page 68 for further details on the trading and afs portfolios see note 3 and note 7 respectively private equity investments valuation of private investments held by jpmorgan partners requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and longterm nature of such assets private investments are initially valued based on cost the carrying values of private investments are adjusted from cost to reflect both positive and negative changes evidenced by financing events with thirdparty capital providers in addition these investments are subject to ongoing impairment reviews by jpmp’s senior investment professionals a variety of factors are reviewed and monitored to assess impairment including but not limited to operating performance and future expectations comparable industry valuations of public companies changes in market outlook and thirdparty financing environment over time for additional information about private equity investments see the private equity risk management discussion on page 65 and note 13 on page 88 msrs and certain other retained interests msrs and certain other retained interests from securitization activities do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices for example sales of msrs do occur but the precise terms and conditions are typically not readily available as such the firm estimates the fair value of msrs and certain other retained interests using a discounted future cash flow model the model considers portfolio characteristics contractually specified servicing fees and prepayment assumptions delinquent rates late charges other ancillary revenues costs to service and other economic factors the firm compares its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience management believes that the fair values and related assumptions are comparable to those used by other market participants for a further discussion of the most significant assumptions used to value these retained interests as well as the applicable stress tests for those assumptions see notes 11 and 12 on pages 83–87 and 87–88 respectively    management’s discussion and analysis jp morgan chase  co accounting and reporting developments accounting for stockbased compensation in august 2002 jpmorgan chase announced its decision to adopt sfas 123 beginning january 2003 sfas 123 establishes accounting for stockbased compensation that requires all such transactions including stock options to be accounted for at fair value and such amounts to be recognized in earnings the firm adopted the fair value provisions of sfas 123 effective january 1 2003 using the prospective transition method under this method all new awards granted to employees on or after january 1 2003 will be accounted for at fair value awards outstanding as of december 31 2002 if not subsequently modified continue to be accounted for under apb 25 it is estimated that the adoption of sfas 123 with respect to employee stockbased compensation awards granted in february 2003 will reduce the firm’s net income by approximately 008 per share in 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities in january 2003 the fasb issued fin 46 the entities that would be assessed for consolidation under fin 46 are typically referred to as specialpurpose entities “spes” although other nonspetype entities may also be subject to the guidance fin 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both the provisions are effective for any new entities that are originated subsequent to january 31 2003 for entities that were originated prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 are effective july 1 2003 the firm is assessing the impact of fin 46 on all variable interest entities with which it is involved including the multiseller conduit transactions that are further described in note 11 on pages 83–87 in their current form these conduits would be required to be consolidated on the firm’s balance sheet when fin 46 is implemented the firm is assessing restructuring alternatives associated with the multiseller conduits management’s assessment of possible consolidations of other entities that could be deemed variable interest entities is ongoing as well however at this time the firm does not believe that the implementation of fin 46 will have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated balance sheet earnings or capital resources guarantor disclosures in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 which requires a guarantor to recognize at inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee fin 45 also requires certain disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements ending december 31 2002 the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the application of fin 45 will not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet see note 29 on pages 102–103 for fin 45 disclosures accounting for trading derivatives in october 2002 the emerging issues task force concluded on issue 02–03 which precludes marktomarket accounting for energyrelated contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative under sfas 133 eg transportation storage or capacity contracts effective january 1 2003 this decision will not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated statement of income in november 2002 as part of the discussion of issue 02–03 the fasb staff further confirmed their view that an entity should not recognize profit at the inception of a trade involving a derivative financial instrument in the absence of a quoted market prices in an active market b observable prices of other current market transactions or c other observable data supporting a valuation technique this clarification did not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated statement of income in 2002 the fasb intends in 2003 to continue its focus on issues relating to the fair value of financial instruments impairment of longlived assets in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas 144 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment andor disposal of longlived assets sfas 144 supersedes and resolves certain implementation issues of sfas 121 but retains its fundamental provisions for a the recognition and measurement of the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used and b the measurement of longlived assets to be disposed of by sale sfas 144 also supersedes the business segment disposal provisions of apb 30 but retains its requirement to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and broadens its definition of discontinued operations from “segment of a business” activities that represent a major line of business or customer to “component of an entity” operations and cash flows that can clearly be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity sfas 144 does not significantly affect the firm’s operating results the firm performs periodic impairment reviews of its longlived assets in accordance with sfas 144 and there are no discontinued operations to report in 2002 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas 146 which establishes new accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 sfas 146 requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recorded when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value under the previous rules if management approved an exit plan in one quarter the costs of that plan generally would have been recorded in the same quarter even if the costs were not incurred until a later quarter in    contrast under sfas 146 some costs may qualify for immediate recognition while other costs may be incurred over one or more quarters the impact of sfas 146 will be to spread out the timing of the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities allowance for loan losses in 1999 the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants formed the allowance for loan losses task force “task force” to research current accounting guidance and practices as they relate to loan losses it is currently expected that the task force will issue an exposure draft of a statement of position in 2003 that will provide additional accounting and reporting guidance and clarification of the factors to consider in determining the allowance for loan losses goodwill and other intangible assets effective january 1 2002 the firm adopted sfas 142 which establishes the accounting for intangible assets other than those acquired in a business combination it also addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to an acquisition for a further discussion on the adoption of sfas 142 see note 14 comparison between 2001 and 2000 jpmorgan chase reported 2001 net income of 17 billion compared with net income of 57 billion in 2000 reported net income per share was 080 in 2001 compared with 286 in 2000 total reported revenues for 2001 of 293 billion were down 12 from the prior year these results reflected losses on private equity investments and to a lesser degree lower investment banking fees and trading revenues which included 359 million of losses related to exposure to enron and argentina also contributing to the decline were net gains on sales of nonstrategic assets of 13 billion in 2000 the revenue declines were partially offset by higher net interest income primarily from higher volumes of interestearning assets particularly credit card receivables and residential mortgages and security gains from sales of afs securities that had been positioned to benefit from 2001’s low interest rate environment the firm’s business segments reported mixed revenue results in 2001 in ib revenues were lower than the prior year reflecting the overall market decline in equity underwriting and ma activities record fees from bond underwriting due to lower interest rates partially offset these declines tradingrelated revenues in 2001 were also lower than in 2000 primarily driven by thinner margins on sales of equity securities and a reduced demand for equity derivatives impb’s revenues declined from the prior year reflecting the lower value of assets under supervision a lower volume of international retail fund flows and a reduction in the number of brokerage transactions there was also a decrease in fees driven by clients shifting from highermargin equity to lowermargin fixedincome products jpmp recognized private equity losses of 12 billion in 2001 compared with gains of 10 billion in 2000 attributable to unfavorable valuation adjustments on both publicly and privatelyheld investments — particularly in the telecommunications media and technology sectors offsetting these revenue declines was a slight increase in revenue at tss reflecting revenue growth at institutional trust services and treasury services partially offset by a decline at investor services resulting from depressed market prices for equity securities and lower interest rates cfs had solid revenue growth driven by greater consumer loan originations and higher fees from increased utilization of consumer banking and insurance products in 2001 while revenue was reduced by the negative effects of increased levels of mortgage loan prepayments due to lower interest rates these declines were substantially offset by increased securities gains and record mortgage sales activity the firm’s total reported noninterest expense was 236 billion in 2001 up 2 from 2000 reflecting higher merger and restructuring costs partly offset by lower compensation expense merger and restructuring costs increased to 25 billion in 2001 from 14 billion in 2000 the increase was primarily related to costs associated with the merger of jp morgan and chase including systems integration realignment of facilities and retention or severance payments compensation expense fell 6 driven by staff reductions and lower incentive compensation as a result of the decline in earnings at the businesssegment level ib impb and jpmp all reported lower noninterest expense largely driven by reductions in headcount related to the merger and lower incentive compensation tss expenses rose slightly as a result of strategic investments across its three businesses offset by expensecontrol initiatives cfs also reported higher expenses in 2001 stemming from higher mortgage loan servicing costs the acquisition of advanta corp’s mortgage business and higher credit card marketing costs these costs were partially offset by savings achieved through restructuring productivity and quality programs the provision for credit losses in 2001 rose to 32 billion from 14 billion in 2000 the increase reflected the impact of higher net chargeoffs in both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios as well as an increase in the loan loss allowance by 850 million due to provisions in excess of net chargeoffs the increase in commercial chargeoffs was primarily the result of higher domestic commercial net chargeoffs particularly in the telecom and related sector and for enron the higher chargeoffs in the consumer loan portfolio were due to higher consumer bankruptcy levels as well as higher nonbankruptcyrelated losses income tax expense in 2001 was 847 million compared with 30 billion in 2000 the effective tax rate was 33 for 2001 compared with 34 for 2000 the decrease in the effective tax rate was principally the result of the decrease in reported pretax

do not meet the sfas 140 definition of a “repurchase agreement” are accounted for as “buys” and “sells” rather than financing transactions these transactions are accounted for as a purchase sale of the underlying securities with a forward obligation to sell purchase the securities the forward purchase sale obligation a derivative is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in trading revenue notional amounts of transactions accounted for as purchases under sfas 140 were 8 billion and 6 billion at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively notional amounts of transactions accounted for as sales under sfas 140 were 13 billion and 27 billion at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively based on the shortterm duration of these contracts the unrealized gain or loss is insignificant securities borrowed and securities lent are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received securities borrowed consist primarily of government and equity securities jpmorgan chase monitors the market value of the securities borrowed and lent on a daily basis and calls for additional collateral when appropriate fees received or paid are recorded in interest income or interest expense  jpmorgan chase pledges certain financial instruments it owns to collateralize repurchase agreements and other securities financings pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by the secured party are identified as financial instruments owned pledged to various parties on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2002 the firm had received securities as collateral that can be repledged delivered or otherwise used with a fair value of approximately 214 billion this collateral was generally obtained under reverse repurchase or securities borrowing agreements of these securities approximately 199 billion were repledged delivered or otherwise used generally as collateral under repurchase agreements securities lending agreements or to cover short sales note 9 loans loans are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding net of the allowance for loan losses unearned income and any net deferred loan fees loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value loans are classified as “trading” for secondary market trading activities where positions are bought and sold to make profits from shortterm    movements in price loans held for trading purposes are included in trading assets and are carried at fair value with the gains and losses included in trading revenue interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is discontinued loans other than certain consumer loans discussed below are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if in the opinion of management full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and collateral if any is insufficient to cover principal and interest interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income in addition the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash however where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of loan principal all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan loans are restored to accrual status only when interest and principal payments are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured consumer loans are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council’s “ffiec” policy for example credit card loans are charged off at the earlier of 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification of the filing of bankruptcy residential mortgage products are generally charged off to net realizable value at 180 days past due other consumer products are generally charged off to net realizable value if collateralized at 120 days past due accrued interest on residential mortgage products auto financings and certain other consumer loans are accounted for in accordance with the nonaccrual loan policy discussed above accrued interest on all other loans is generally reversed against interest income when the consumer loan is charged off a collateralized loan is considered an insubstance foreclosure and is reclassified to assets acquired as loan satisfactions within other assets only when jpmorgan chase has taken physical possession of the collateral regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings have taken place the composition of the loan portfolio at each of the dates indicated was as follows   the following table reflects information about the firm’s loans held for sale principally mortgagerelated  impaired loans jpmorgan chase accounts for and discloses nonaccrual commercial loans as impaired loans and recognizes their interest income as discussed previously for nonaccrual loans the firm excludes from impaired loans its smallbalance homogeneous consumer loans loans carried at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value debt securities and leases the table below sets forth information about jpmorgan chase’s impaired loans the firm uses discounted cash flow as its primary method for valuing impaired loans      notes to consolidated financial statements jp morgan chase  co note 10 allowance for credit losses jpmorgan chase’s allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probable credit losses for which either the asset is not specifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined within the allowance there are specific and expected loss components and a residual component the specific loss component covers those commercial loans deemed by the firm to be criticized the firm internally categorizes its criticized commercial loans into three groups doubtful substandard and special mention criticized nonperforming commercial loans excluding leases are considered to be impaired loans the allowance for impaired loans is computed using the methodology under sfas 114 an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of an impaired loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan to compute the specific loss component of the allowance larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets criticized but performing loans also are evaluated as a pool using historical loss rates the expected loss component covers performing commercial loans except criticized loans and consumer loans expected losses are the product of default probability and loss severity these factors are differentiated by risk rating and maturity for commercial loans the expected loss estimates for each consumer loan portfolio are based primarily on the firm’s historical loss experience for the applicable product portfolio finally a residual component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses the residual component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision in the underlying assumptions used for estimating specific losses and expected losses it is anticipated that the residual component of the allowance will range between 10 and 20 of the total allowance for credit losses jpmorgan chase’s risk management committee reviews at least quarterly the allowance for credit losses relative to the risk profile of the firm’s credit portfolio and current economic conditions the allowance is adjusted based on that review if in management’s judgment changes are warranted as of december 31 2002 jpmorgan chase deemed the allowance to be adequate ie sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the portfolio but are not yet identifiable to provide for the risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process management also computes specific and expected loss components as well as a residual component for lendingrelated commitments using a methodology similar to that used for the loan portfolio jpmorgan chase maintains an allowance for credit losses as follows  the table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for loan losses  the table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for lendingrelated commitments     note 11 specialpurpose entities the terms specialpurpose entity “spe” and specialpurpose vehicle “spv” are used interchangeably in practice spes are an important part of the financial markets providing market liquidity by facilitating investors’ access to specific portfolios of assets and risks they are for example critical to the functioning of the mortgage and assetbacked securities and commercial paper markets spes may be organized as trusts partnerships or corporations and are typically set up for a single discrete purpose spes are not operating entities and usually have no employees and a limited life the basic spe structure involves a company selling assets to the spe the spe funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors the legal documents that govern the spe transaction describe how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to its investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows spes can be structured to be bankruptcy remote thereby insulating investors from the impact of the creditors of other entities including the seller of the assets where jpmorgan chase is a transferor of financial assets to an spe the assets sold are derecognized and the spe is not consolidated on the firm’s balance sheet when the assets are 1 legally isolated from the firm’s creditors 2 the accounting criteria for a sale are met and 3 the spe is a qualifying specialpurpose entity “qspe” under sfas 140 when an spe does not meet the formal definition of a qspe the decision whether or not to consolidate depends on the applicable accounting principles for nonqspes including a determination regarding the nature and amount of investment made by third parties in the spe consideration is given to among other factors whether a third party has made a substantive equity investment in the spe which party has voting rights if any who makes decisions about the assets in the spe and who is at risk for loss the spe is consolidated if jpmorgan chase retains or acquires control over the risks and rewards of the assets in the spe all transactions and retained interests between the firm and spes are reflected on jpmorgan chase’s consolidated balance sheet or in the notes to the financial statements the firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support an spe transaction and its policies require that transactions with spes be conducted at arms’ length and reflect market pricing consistent with this policy no jpmorgan chase employee is permitted to invest in spes with which the firm is involved where such investment would violate the firm’s worldwide rules of conduct these rules prohibit employees from selfdealing and from acting on behalf of the firm in transactions with which they or their family have any significant financial interest jpmorgan chase is involved with spes in three broad categories of transactions loan securitizations multiseller conduits and client intermediation loan securitizations jpmorgan chase securitizes sells and services residential mortgage credit card automobile and commercial loans assets sold to spes as part of the securitization process are not reflected in jpmorgan chase’s consolidated balance sheet except for retained interests as described below but are included on the balance sheet of the spe purchasing the assets assets held by securitizationrelated spes as of december 31 2002 and 2001 were as follows  interests in securitized and sold loans are generally retained by the firm in the form of senior or subordinated interestonly strips subordinated tranches escrow accounts and servicing rights and they are primarily recorded in other assets in addition credit card securitization trusts require the firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the trusts which represents the firm’s interests in the receivables transferred to the trust that have not been securitized these interests are not represented by security certificates the firm’s undivided interests are carried at historical cost and are classified in loans jpmorgan chase retains servicing responsibilities for all residential mortgage credit card and automobile loan securitizations and for certain commercial loan securitizations it establishes the firm receives annual servicing fees based on the securitized loan balance plus certain ancillary fees it also retains the right to service the residential mortgage loans it sells in connection with mortgagebacked securities transactions with the government national mortgage association “gnma” federal national mortgage association “fnma” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” for a discussion of mortgage servicing rights see note 12 gains or losses recorded on securitizations and sales depend in part on the carrying amount of the assets sold and are allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of sale since quoted market prices are generally not available the firm usually estimates fair value of these retained interests by determining the present value of future expected cash flows using modeling techniques such models incorporate management’s best estimates of key variables such as expected credit losses prepayment speeds and discount rates appropriate for the risks involved gains on securitizations and sales are reported in other revenue retained interests that are subject to prepayment risk such that jpmorgan chase may not recover substantially all of its investment are recorded at fair value with subsequent adjustments reflected in    notes to consolidated financial statements jp morgan chase  co other comprehensive income or in earnings if the fair value of the retained interest has declined below its carrying amount and such decline has been determined to be otherthantemporary during 2002 the firm securitized approximately 72 billion of residential mortgage loans 94 billion of credit card loans 34 billion of automobile loans and 43 billion of commercial loans resulting in pretax gains on securitizations of 214 million 45 million 6 million and 53 million respectively during 2001 the firm securitized approximately 79 billion of residential mortgage loans 6 billion of credit card loans 25 billion of automobile loans and 55 billion of commercial loans resulting in pretax gains on securitizations of 242 million 42 million 17 million and 40 million respectively in addition the firm sold residential mortgage loans totaling 622 billion and 458 billion during 2002 and 2001 respectively primarily as gnma fnma and freddie mac mortgagebacked securities these sales resulted in gains of 388 million in 2002 and 262 million in 2001 the following table summarizes certain cash flows received from securitization trusts for sales that were completed during 2002 and 2001 and the key economic assumptions used in measuring the retained interests as of the dates of such sales   on february 5 2002 jpmorgan chase acquired the providian master trust consisting of credit card receivables of approximately 79 billion and related relationships accounting principles required that all of the purchased receivables including those that had been securitized be initially reflected on the firm’s consolidated balance sheet together with a related liability to reflect the securities issued by the trust to third parties this liability totaled 63 billion on february 5 2002 and was recorded in other borrowed funds as credit card receivables revolve and new receivables are sold to investors through the securitization trust these newly sold receivables and related liability are removed from the balance sheet as permitted by securitization accounting principles during the period from the acquisition date to december 31 2002 56 billion of the liability had been removed from the consolidated balance sheet either through the revolving sales of new receivables to investors or the maturing of investor securities at december 31 2002 07 billion of the originally purchased and securitized receivables and the related liability of 07 billion remained on the balance sheet the interest rate of the remaining liability is a combination of fixed and variable rates which reflects the coupon rates of the securities issued to third parties these rates ranged from 153 to 798 at december 31 2002 the liability is expected to be substantially removed from the balance sheet by june 2003 in addition at december 31 2002 the firm had on its balance sheet 27 billion relating to its undivided interest in the providian master trust and 117 million related to its subordinated interest in accrued interest and fees on securitized receivables at december 31 2002 and 2001 jpmorgan chase had 46 billion and 39 billion respectively related to its undivided interest in its chase credit card master trust and 861 million and 878 million respectively in its subordinated interest in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables the firm also maintains escrow accounts up to predetermined limits for some of its residential mortgage credit card and automobile securitizations in the unlikely event of deficiencies in cash flows owed to investors the amounts available in such escrow accounts are recorded in other assets and as of december 31 2002 amounted to 510 million and 94 million for credit card and automobile securitizations respectively as of december 31 2001 these amounts were 1 million 341 million and 79 million for residential mortgage credit card and automobile securitizations respectively additionally the firm had other retained securitization interests as of december 31 2002 and 2001 of 684 million and 1 billion from residential mortgages 92 million and 38 million from credit cards 151 million and 141 million from auto loans and 94 million and 66 million from commercial loans these retained interests are primarily subordinated or residual interests    the table below outlines the key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of fair values at december 31 2002 of the remaining retained interests to immediate 10 and 20 adverse changes in those assumptions   the sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical changes in fair value based on a 10 variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear also in this table the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another assumption which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities expected static pool net credit losses include actual incurred losses plus projected net credit losses divided by the original balance of the outstandings comprising the securitization pool the table below displays the expected static pool net credit losses for 2002 2001 and 2000 based on securitizations occurring in that year   the table below presents information about delinquencies net credit losses and components of reported and securitized financial assets at december 31 2002   total assets held in securitizationrelated spes as of december 31 2002 were 906 billion see table on page 83 the 540 billion of loans securitized at december 31 2002 shown in the table above excludes 269 billion of securitized loans in which the firm’s only continuing involvement is the servicing of the assets 82 billion of seller’s interests in credit card master trusts and subordinated accrued interest and fees 07 billion of providian master trust receivables which are reflected as receivables on the firm’s consolidated balance sheet until paid off or revolve into new receivables sold to investors and 08 billion of escrow accounts and other assets    notes to consolidated financial statements jp morgan chase  co multiseller conduits jpmorgan chase serves as the administrator and provides contingent liquidity support and limited credit enhancement for several commercial paper conduits these conduits provide clients access to liquidity in the commercial paper markets by allowing them to sell assets to the conduit which then issues commercial paper to investors to fund the purchases the firm does not sell assets to these commercial paper conduits commercial paper issued by conduits for which the firm acts as administrator aggregated 175 billion at december 31 2002 the commercial paper issued is backed by sufficient collateral credit enhancements and commitments to provide liquidity to support receiving at least an a1 p1 and in certain cases an f1 rating jpmorgan chase bank has commitments to provide liquidity to these vehicles in an amount up to 235 billion the firm would be required to provide funding under the liquidity commitments in the event that funding for such spes became unavailable in the commercial paper market in addition if jpmorgan chase bank were downgraded below a1 p1 and in certain cases f1 the firm could also be required to provide funding under these commitments since commercial paper rated below a1 p1 or f1 would generally not be issuable by the vehicle under these circumstances jpmorgan chase bank could either replace itself as liquidity provider or facilitate the sale or refinancing of the assets held in the spe in other markets jpmorgan chase applies the same underwriting standards in making liquidity commitments to conduits as the firm would with other extensions of credit for certain multiseller conduits jpmorgan chase also provides limited credit enhancement primarily through the issuance of letters of credit under the letters of credit the firm could be required to fund the difference between the commercial paper outstanding and amounts drawn under the liquidity commitment if any as of december 31 2002 commitments under these letters of credit totaled 34 billion the firm has limited credit exposure to multiseller conduit transactions this is because for the most part the firm is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if the assets in the spe are in default additionally the firm’s obligations under the letters of credit are secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the client or other third parties — for example by the overcollateralization of the spe with the assets sold to it client intermediation as a financial intermediary the firm is involved in structuring spe transactions to meet investor and client needs the firm intermediates various types of risks including for example fixed income equity and credit typically using derivative instruments in certain circumstances the firm also provides liquidity and other support to the spes to facilitate the transaction each of the firm’s relationships with the spes is reflected on the firm’s consolidated balance sheet or in the notes to the financial statements the risks inherent in derivative instruments or liquidity commitments are managed similar to other credit market and liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed in its capacity as a financial intermediary the firm has created structured commercial loan vehicles managed by third parties in which loans are purchased from third parties or through the firm’s syndication and trading functions and funded by issuing commercial paper investors provide collateral and have a first risk of loss up to the amount of collateral pledged the firm retains a second risk of loss position for these vehicles the documentation includes provisions intended subject to certain conditions to enable jpmorgan chase to terminate the transactions related to a particular loan vehicle if the value of the relevant portfolio declines below a specified level the amount of the commercial paper issued by these vehicles as of december 31 2002 totaled 72 billion jpmorgan chase bank has a commitment to provide liquidity to these spes in an amount up to 120 billion jpmorgan chase also structures spes to modify the cash flows of thirdparty assets to create investments with specific risk profiles or to assist clients in the efficient management of other risks for example the firm structures creditlinked notes in which the spe purchases highlyrated assets such as assetbacked securities and enters into a credit derivative contract with the firm to obtain exposure to a referenced credit not held by the spe creditlinked notes are issued by the spe to transfer the risk of the referenced credit to the investors in the spe as of december 31 2002 the aggregate assets held by the creditlinked note vehicles were 79 billion additionally jpmorgan chase structures on behalf of clients vehicles in which the firm transfers the risks and returns of the assets held by the spe typically debt and equity instruments to clients through derivative contracts the firm’s net exposure arising from these intermediation transactions is not significant the aggregate assets held by these client intermediation vehicles were 74 billion at december 31 2002 the firm’s current exposure to all of these vehicles is reflected in its consolidated financial statements as the fair value of the derivative contracts are recorded in trading assets or trading liabilities and changes in fair value are recognized in trading revenue finally the firm may enter into transactions with spes structured by other parties these transactions can include for example acting as derivative counterparty liquidity provider investor underwriter trustee or custodian these transactions are conducted at arms’ length and individual credit decisions are based upon the analysis of the specific spe taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets typically the firm would not be the sole liquidity provider to a thirdparty spe jpmorgan chase records and reports these positions similar to any other thirdparty transaction for example derivative contracts are recorded at fair value and reported in note 3 whereas liquidity facilities are included within the firm’s lendingrelated commitments described in more detail in note 29 fees received when the firm operates in an administrative capacity such as underwriter trustee or custodian are recorded in fees and commissions    variable interest entities in january 2003 the fasb issued fin 46 entities that would be assessed for consolidation under fin 46 are typically spes although other nonspetype entities may also be subject to the guidance fin 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company will absorb a majority of the expected losses will receive a majority of the expected residual returns or both transferors to a qspe which represent a majority of the firm’s loan securitization transactions discussed above and certain other interests in a qspe are not subject to the requirements of fin 46 the firm is required to apply fin 46 for variable interest entities created or modified after january 31 2003 in which the firm has an interest for variable interest entities created prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 are effective july 1 2003 variable interest entities with which the firm is involved that do not meet the qspe criteria primarily include the multiseller conduits and the client intermediation vehicles described above the firm is also involved with other entities that could be deemed variable interest entities and therefore could be subject to fin 46 these entities would include certain majorityowned subsidiaries reported in the firm’s consolidated financial statements the firm is assessing the impact of fin 46 on all variable interest entities with which it is involved the multiseller conduits which have 175 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2002 would in their current form be required to be consolidated on the firm’s balance sheet when fin 46 is implemented the firm is analyzing restructuring options for the multiseller conduits based upon its current interpretation of fin 46 the firm does not believe that it would be required to consolidate the vehicles related to the creditlinked notes or the client intermediation transactions with assets of 79 billion and 74 billion respectively as of december 31 2002 management is continuing to assess the possible consolidation of other entities that could be deemed variable interest entities including the structured commercial loan vehicles at this time management does not believe that the implementation of fin 46 will have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated balance sheet earnings or capital resources note 12 mortgage servicing rights jpmorgan chase recognizes as intangible assets mortgage servicing rights “msrs”which represent the right to perform specified residential mortgage servicing activities for others servicing activities include collecting principal interest and escrow payments from borrowers making tax and insurance payments on behalf of the borrowers monitoring delinquencies and executing foreclosure proceedings and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to the investors of the mortgagebacked securities msrs are either purchased from third parties or retained upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans the amount capitalized as msrs represents the current fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing the servicing activities msr fair values are estimated using a discounted future cash flow model that considers portfolio characteristics contractually specified servicing fees and management’s assumptions regarding prepayment speeds delinquency rates late charges other ancillary revenues the cost to service the mortgage loans as well as other economic factors management uses its best judgment to estimate fair value since many economic factors can affect the estimate of the fair value of msrs the firm periodically assesses the assumptions and modeling techniques used to estimate the fair value of its msrs msrs are amortized as a reduction of the actual servicing income received in proportion to and over the period of the estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying mortgage loans for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of msrs the firm stratifies its portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk characteristics loan type and interest rate any indicated impairment is recognized as a reduction in revenue through a valuation allowance to the extent that the carrying value of an individual stratum exceeds its estimated fair value the carrying value of msrs is sensitive to changes in interest rates including their effect on prepayment speeds the firm offsets this interest rate risk by designating certain interest rate derivatives eg a combination of swaps swaptions and floors that produces an interest rate profile opposite to the msrs as fair value hedges of specified msrs under sfas 133 sfas 133 hedge accounting allows the carrying value of the hedged msrs to be adjusted through earnings in the same period that the change in value of the hedging derivatives is recognized through earnings both of these valuation adjustments are recorded in the mortgage servicing fees component within fees and commissions for a further discussion on derivative instruments and hedging activities see note 28 on pages 101 and 102 afs securities and certain “nonhedge” derivatives are also used to manage the risk exposure of msrs these instruments are accounted for as standalone instruments because afs securities do not qualify as hedges under sfas 133 and the derivatives have not been designated by management as hedging derivatives accordingly the securities are accounted for as afs securities under sfas 115 and the “nonhedge” derivatives are accounted for as trading derivatives realized gains and losses on the afs securities are recognized in earnings in securities gains losses gains and losses on the “nonhedge” derivatives are recognized in earnings in trading revenue unrealized gains and losses on afs securities are reported in other comprehensive income for a further discussion of the risk management activities regarding msrs see the chase financial services segment discussion on pages 35 and 36    notes to consolidated financial statements jp morgan chase  co the following table summarizes mortgage servicing rights activity and related amortization for the dates indicated it also includes the key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of msrs at december 31 2002 to immediate 10 and 20 adverse changes in each of those assumptions    the sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution as the figures indicate changes in fair value based on a 10 and 20 variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear also in this table the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities the valuation allowance represents the extent to which the carrying value of msrs exceeds its estimated fair value changes in the valuation allowance are the result of the recognition of impairment or the recovery of previously recognized impairment charges due to changes in market conditions during the period the changes in the valuation allowance for msrs for the dates indicated were as follows  note 13 private equity investments private equity investments are primarily held by jpmorgan partners “jpmp” the firm’s global private equity investment business segment these investments include public and private investments that are made in the normal course of jpmp’s business private equity investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines accordingly these investments irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interest held by jpmp are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value the fair value of public investments held by jpmp are markedtomarket at the quoted public value to determine the carrying values of these investments jpmp incorporates the use of liquidity discounts to take into account the fact that it cannot immediately realize or hedge the quoted public values as a result of regulatory corporate andor contractual sales restrictions imposed on these holdings private investments are initially valued based on cost the carrying values of private investments are adjusted from cost to reflect both positive and negative changes evidenced by financing events with thirdparty capital providers in addition these investments are subject to ongoing impairment reviews by jpmp’s senior investment professionals a variety of factors are reviewed and monitored to assess impairment including but not limited to operating performance and future expectations comparable industry valuations of public companies changes in market outlook and changes in the thirdparty financing environment realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in value are reported in private equity realized gains losses and private equity unrealized gains losses respectively in the consolidated statement of income in the period that the gain or loss occurs the following table presents the carrying value and cost of the private equity investment portfolio for the dates indicated  the following table presents private equity investment realized and unrealized gains and losses for the periods indicated      note 14 goodwill and other intangibles effective january 1 2002 the firm adopted sfas 142 reclassifying certain intangible assets from goodwill to other intangible assets there was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of sfas 142 goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit segment which is one level below the five major business segments as described in note 33 on page 108 goodwill is tested annually during the fourth quarter or more often if events or circumstances such as adverse changes in the business climate indicate that there may be impairment other acquired intangible assets determined to have finite lives such as core deposits and credit card relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives in a manner that best reflects the economic benefits of the intangible asset in addition impairment testing is performed periodically on these amortizing intangible assets for a discussion of capitalized msrs see note 12 on page 87 the following table presents the impact of sfas 142 on net income and earnings per share had the accounting standard been in effect for 2001 and 2000   goodwill after giving effect to the adoption of sfas 142 goodwill increased during 2002 by 63 million principally in connection with acquisitions of businesses by treasury  securities services goodwill was also reduced during the year by purchase accounting adjustments goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2002 nor was any goodwill written off during 2002 as of december 31 2002 the firm had goodwill of 8096 million goodwill by business segment is as follows investment bank 2051 million investment management  private banking 4165 million treasury  securities services 996 million jpmorgan partners 377 million and chase financial services 507 million other intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2002 purchased credit card relationship intangibles increased by approximately 1030 million primarily due to the acquisition of providian intangibles which have an estimated life of seven years in addition other intangibles primarily customer relationships other than credit card increased by 72 million all of the firm’s acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization for the year ended december 31 2002 intangible assets amortization expense was 323 million this amount included a 12 million impairment writedown on purchased credit card relationships related to a small credit card portfolio that had been acquired previously the components of other intangible assets were as follows  amortization expense for the net carrying amount of intangible assets is estimated to be 302 million in 2003 285 million in 2004 270 million in 2005 255 million in 2006 and 219 million in 2007 the other intangible assets above do not include mortgage servicing rights amortization of mortgage servicing rights is recorded as a reduction of mortgage servicing revenues within fees and commissions see note 12 for a discussion of mortgage servicing rights note 15 premises and equipment premises and equipment including leasehold improvements are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization jpmorgan chase generally computes depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of an asset for leasehold improvements the firm uses the straightline method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the estimated economic life of the improvement jpmorgan chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internaluse software once the software is ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straightline basis over the software’s expected useful life    notes to consolidated financial statements jp

table is a summary of longterm debt net of unamortized original issue debt discount and sfas 133 valuation adjustments   the weightedaverage contractual interest rate for total longterm debt was 551 and 512 as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively in order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements jpmorgan chase utilizes derivative instruments primarily interest rate and crosscurrency interest rate swaps in conjunction with some of its debt issues the use of these instruments modifies the firm’s interest expense on the associated debt the modified weightedaverage interest rate for total longterm debt including the effects of related derivative instruments was 342 and 464 as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively jpmorgan chase has guaranteed

benefit pension plans and postretirement medical and life insurance jpmorgan chase has a qualified noncontributory us pension plan that provides defined benefits to substantially all us employees the us plan employs a cash balance defined benefit formula in the form of service and interest credits in determining the benefits to be provided at retirement based on eligible compensation and years of service employees begin to accrue plan benefits after completing one year of service and benefits vest after five years of service the prior plans of chase and jp morgan were merged as of december 31 2001 for jp morgan employees who were earning benefits under a prior plan formula as of december 31 1998 the plan also provides a minimum benefit based on eligible compensation and years of service through december 31 2003 the firm also offers defined benefits to qualifying employees in certain nonus locations based on eligible compensation and years of service the firm’s defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in accordance with sfas 87 and sfas 88 it is jpmorgan chase’s policy to fund its pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable employee benefit and local tax laws in 2002 the firm made cash contributions totaling 12 billion to fund fully the accumulated benefit obligations of the us and certain nonus defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2002 on february 10 2003 the firm made an additional cash contribution of 127 million to fund fully the us defined benefit pension plan to its projected benefit obligation at december 31 2002 these contributions were made following the decline in value of plan assets resulting from adverse capital market conditions the firm’s us pension assets are held in a trust and are invested in equity fixed income cash equivalent and other securities us pension assets do not include jpmorgan chase common stock except in connection with investments in thirdparty stockindex funds the firm offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to qualifying us employees these benefits vary with length of service and date of hire and provide for limits on jpmorgan chase’s share of covered medical benefits the medical benefits are contributory while the life insurance benefits are noncontributory postretirement medical benefits are also offered to qualifying uk employees the firm’s postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with sfas 106      the following tables present the funded status and amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheet and the components

jpmorgan chase’s us postretirement benefit obligation is partially funded with corporateowned life insurance coli purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees assets of the coli policies are held in separate accounts with an insurance company and are invested in equities bonds and other debt securities while jpmorgan chase owns the coli policies coli proceeds death benefits withdrawals and other distributions may be used only to reimburse the firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and related administrative expenses the following table presents the weightedaverage annualized actuarial assumptions for the firm’s us and nonus defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans as of december 31    

nanot applicable 

with all other assumptions held constant a 25basis point decline in the assumed longterm rate of return on us plan assets would result in an increase of approximately 13 million in 2003 us pension and other postretirement benefit expenses a 25–basis point decline in the discount rate for the us plans would result in an increase in 2003 us pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of approximately 10 million and an increase in the related benefit obligation of approximately 122 million these increases would be mostly offset by the effect of a similar reduction in the assumed interest rate used for crediting participant balances jpmorgan chase has a number of other defined benefit pension plans ie us plans not subject to title iv of the employee retirement income security act the most significant of these plans is the excess retirement plan where certain employees earn service credits on compensation amounts above the maximum limitation stipulated by law this plan is a nonqualified noncontributory us pension plan and is unfunded compensation expense related to the firm’s other defined benefit pension plans totaled 15 million in 2002 22 million in 2001 and 22 million in 2000 at december 31 2002 jpmorgan chase’s assumed weightedaverage medical benefits cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered was 100 for 2002 declining gradually over eight years to a floor of 50 the effect of a 1 change in the assumed medical cost trend rate would result in a corresponding change in the december 31 2002 benefit obligation and 2002 periodic expense by up to 44 defined contribution plans jpmorgan chase offers several defined contribution plans in the us and certain nonus locations the most significant of these plans is the 401k savings plan covering substantially all us employees this plan allows employees to make pretax contributions to taxdeferred investment portfolios the firm matches the employee’s contributions dollar for dollar up to a certain percentage of eligible compensation per pay period subject to plan and legal limits employees begin to receive matching contributions after completing one year of service and benefits vest after three years of service the firm’s defined contribution plans are administered in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations compensation expense related to these plans totaled 251 million in 2002 208 million in 2001 and 213 million in 2000 note 24 employee stockbased incentives through december 31 2002 jpmorgan chase accounted for its employee stockbased compensation plans under the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb 25 there is no expense recognized for stock options as they were granted at the stock price on the grant date and therefore they have no intrinsic value compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units “rsus” is measured based on the number of shares granted and the stock price at the grant date and recognized over the required service period effective january 1 2003 jpmorgan chase will adopt sfas 123 using the prospective transition method sfas 123 requires all stockbased compensation awards including stock options to be accounted for at fair value under the prospective transition method all new awards granted to employees on or after january 1 2003 will be accounted for at fair value awards outstanding as of december 31 2002 if not subsequently modified continue to be accounted for under apb 25 fair value will be based on a blackscholes valuation model with compensation expense recognized in earnings over the required service period it is estimated that the adoption of sfas123 with respect to employee stockbased compensation awards granted in february 2003 will reduce the firm’s net income by approximately 008 per share in 2003 the following table details the total number of shares available for issuance under jpmorgan chase employee stockbased incentive plans including shares available for issuance to nonemployee directors the firm is not authorized to grant stockbased incentive awards to nonemployees other than to nonemployee directors        key employee stockbased awards jpmorgan chase grants longterm stockbased incentive awards to certain key employees under two plans the “lti plans” the longterm incentive plan approved by shareholders in may 2000 provides for grants of stock options stock appreciation rights “sars” restricted stock and rsu awards and the stock option plan a nonshareholderapproved plan provides for grants of stock options and sars sars have not been granted under either of these plans under the lti plans stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to jpmorgan chase’s common stock price on the grant date generally options cannot be exercised until at least one year after the grant date and become exercisable over various periods as determined at the time of the grant options generally expire ten years after the grant date in january 2001 jpmorgan chase granted 822 million options under the lti plans pursuant to a growth performance incentive program “gpip” the exercise price of all gpip awards is 5122 the price of jpmorgan chase’s common stock on the grant date because the corporate and business unit performance goals for this award were not achieved these options will become exercisable in january 2007 and expire ten years after the grant date forfeitures of gpip options aggregated 149 million shares through december 31 2002 the following table which includes the gpip awards presents a summary of jpmorgan chase’s option activity under the lti plans during the last three years  the following table which includes the gpip awards details the distribution of options outstanding under the lti plans at december 31 2002  restricted stock and rsus are granted by jpmorgan chase under the lti plans at no cost to the recipient restricted stockrsus are subject to forfeiture until certain restrictions have lapsed including continued employment for a specified period the recipient of a share of restricted stock is entitled to voting rights and dividends on the common stock an rsu entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock after the applicable restrictions lapse the recipient is entitled to receive cash payments equivalent to dividends on the underlying common stock during the period the rsu is outstanding during 2002 240 million restricted stockrsu awards all payable solely in stock were granted by jpmorgan chase under the lti plans in 2001 and 2000 259 million and 361 million awards respectively were granted under these plans the 2001 and 2000 grants each included 13 million restricted stockrsu awards that are forfeitable the vesting of these awards is conditioned upon certain vesting periods being met and jpmorgan chase’s common stock price reaching and sustaining target prices within a fiveyear performance period the expense related to the forfeitable awards is recognized over the designated performance period and measured based on the number of shares granted and the target stock price if the target stock price is achieved then any unrecognized amount is recognized as compensation expense either immediately or over the remaining minimum required service period if the target stock price is achieved prior to completion of such period the 2001 2000 and 1999 forfeitable awards have not vested as the target stock prices have not been achieved see comparison of the fair and intrinsic value measurement methods on the following page for a discussion of the reversal of compensation expense related to these forfeitable awards    notes to consolidated financial statements jp morgan chase  co 

a portion of certain employees’ incentive compensation that exceeds specified levels is awarded in restricted stock or rsu awards the “required deferral plan” issued under the lti plans these restricted stockrsu awards vest solely based on continued employment during 2001 and 2000 137500 and 160000 respectively of such awards were granted the required deferral plan was discontinued in 2002 broadbased employee stock options in january 2002 jpmorgan chase granted 326 million options to all eligible fulltime 375 options each and parttime 188 options each employees under the value sharing plan a nonshareholderapproved plan this award is the third of three equal annual grants to eligible active employees the exercise price for each annual grant is equal to jpmorgan chase’s common stock price on the respective grant date the options become exercisable after five years or earlier if jpmorgan chase’s common stock price reaches and sustains a target price for a minimum period options generally expire ten years after the grant date the 2002 2001 and 2000 grants have not vested as the target stock prices have not been achieved the following table presents a summary of jpmorgan chase’s broadbased employee stock option plan activity during the past three years  the following table details the distribution of broadbased employee stock options outstanding at december 31 2002  comparison of the fair and intrinsic value measurement methods pretax employee stockbased compensation expense recognized in reported earnings totaled 06 billion in 2002 08 billion in 2001 and 11 billion in 2000 compensation expense for 2002 included the reversal of previously accrued expenses in the amount of 120 million related to the forfeitable key employee awards granted in 1999 2000 and 2001 during 2002 it was determined that it was no longer probable that the target stock prices would be achieved within their respective performance periods the target stock prices for these forfeitable awards ranged from 7333 to 8500 the following table presents net income and basic and diluted earnings per share as reported and after the impact of applying sfas 123 the increase in compensation expense after applying sfas 123 in 2002 compared to 2001 reflects expense related to a higher level of options granted in prior years that are not fully vested this increase is partially offset by a decline in the weightedaverage grantdate fair value of options granted in 2002 the higher expense from applying sfas 123 in 2001 compared to 2000 results from the increase in the number of options granted in 2001     the following table presents jpmorgan chase’s weightedaverage grantdate fair values for the employee stockbased compensation awards granted and the assumptions used to value stock options under a blackscholes valuation model   note 25 restrictions on cash and intercompany funds transfers the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” requires depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a federal reserve bank the average amount of reserve balances deposited by jpmorgan chase’s bank subsidiaries with various federal reserve banks was approximately 22 billion in 2002 and 11 billion in 2001 restrictions imposed by federal law prohibit jpmorgan chase and certain other affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts such secured loans to jpmorgan chase or to other affiliates generally are limited to 10 of the banking subsidiary’s total capital as determined by the riskbased capital guidelines the aggregate amount of all such loans is limited to 20 of the banking subsidiary’s total capital jpmorgan chase and its affiliates were well within these limits throughout the year the principal sources of jpmorgan chase’s income on a parent companyonly basis are dividends and interest from jpmorgan chase bank and the other banking and nonbanking subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase in addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations the frb the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” and the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” have authority under the financial institutions supervisory act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies if in the banking regulator’s opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization at january 1 2003 and 2002 jpmorgan chase’s bank subsidiaries could pay in the aggregate 13 billion and 22 billion respectively in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without prior approval of their relevant banking regulators dividend capacity in 2003 will be supplemented by the banks’ earnings during the year in compliance with rules and regulations established by us and nonus regulators as of december 31 2002 and 2001 cash in the amount of 21 billion and 20 billion respectively and securities with a market value of 30 billion and 44 billion respectively were segregated in special bank accounts for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers note 26 capital there are two categories of riskbased capital core capital referred to as tier 1 capital and supplementary capital referred to as tier 2 capital tier 1 capital includes common stockholders’ equity qualifying preferred stock and minority interest less goodwill and other adjustments tier 2 capital consists of preferred stock not qualifying as tier 1 longterm debt and other instruments qualifying as tier 2 the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a certain percentage of riskweighted assets less investments in certain subsidiaries under the riskbased capital guidelines of the frb jpmorgan chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of tier 1 and total tier 1 plus tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets failure to meet these minimum requirements could result in actions taken by the frb bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators management believes that as of december 31 2002 jpmorgan chase met all capital requirements to which it was subject and is not aware of any subsequent events that would alter this classification    notes to consolidated financial statements jp morgan chase  co 

the following table presents the riskbased capital ratios for jpmorgan chase and its significant banking subsidiaries   the following table shows the components of the firm’s tier 1 and total capital   note 27 commitments and contingencies at december 31 2002 jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for banking purposes certain leases contain rent escalation clauses for real estate taxes and other operating expenses and renewal option clauses calling for increased rents no lease agreement imposes any restrictions on jpmorgan chase’s ability to pay dividends engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements future minimum rental payments required under operating leases with noncancelable lease terms that expire after december 31 2002 were as follows  total rental expense was as follows  at december 31 2002 assets were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes the significant components of the assets pledged were as follows      the firm established a reserve of 900 million related to costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with the various private litigations and regulatory inquiries involving enron corp “enron” and the other material legal actions proceedings and investigations in which the firm is currently involved this reserve represents management’s best estimate after consultation with counsel of the current probable aggregate costs associated with these matters of the 900 million 600 million has been allocated to the various cases proceedings and investigations associated with enron the balance of 300 million has been allocated to the various material litigation proceedings and investigations involving the firm’s debt and equity underwriting activities and equity research practices and includes 80 million relating to the firm’s settlement in december 2002 with various regulators relating to equity research practices it is possible that the reserve could be subject to revision in the future in addition to the various cases proceedings and investigations for which the reserve has been established jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of other legal actions and governmental proceedings arising in connection with their respective businesses additional actions investigations or proceedings may be brought from time to time in the future in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the cases present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties the firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of the pending matters including the pending material matters as to which the reserve has been established will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss related to each pending matter will be subject to the foregoing caveat jpmorgan chase anticipates based upon its current knowledge after consultation with counsel and after taking into account the establishment of the aforementioned 900 million reserve that the outcome of the legal actions proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the firm although the outcome of a particular proceeding or the imposition of a particular fine or penalty may be material to jpmorgan chase’s operating results for a particular period depending upon among other factors the size of the loss or liability and the level of jpmorgan chase’s income for that period note 28 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts used for trading and hedging activities all derivatives whether designated for hedging relationships or not are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value the accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether the contract has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting the majority of jpmorgan chase’s derivatives are entered into for trading purposes the firm also uses derivatives as an end user to hedge market exposures modify the interest rate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments or meet longerterm investment objectives both trading and enduser derivatives are recorded at fair value in trading assets and trading liabilities derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes must be considered to be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged each derivative must be designated as a hedge with documentation of the risk management objective and strategy for the hedge including identification of the hedging instrument the hedged item and the risk exposure and how effectiveness is to be assessed prospectively and retrospectively for qualifying fair value hedges all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recognized in earnings if the hedge relationship is terminated then the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment for qualifying cash flow hedges the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income and recognized in the income statement when the hedged cash flows affect earnings the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings if the hedge relationship is terminated then the change in fair value of the derivative recorded in other comprehensive income is recognized consistent with the original hedge strategy when the hedged cash flows occur for hedge relationships discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original strategy any related derivative amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are immediately recognized in earnings for qualifying net investment hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative or the revaluation of the foreign currency–denominated debt instrument are recorded in the translation adjustments account within other comprehensive income    notes to consolidated financial statements jp morgan chase  co 

jpmorgan chase’s fair value hedges primarily include hedges of fixedrate longterm debt loans afs securities and mortgage servicing rights interest rate swaps are the most common type of derivative contract used to modify exposure to interest rate risk by converting fixedrate assets and liabilities to a floating rate interest rate options and swaptions are also used in combination with interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of the firm’s mortgage servicing rights all amounts have been included in earnings consistent with the classification of the hedged item primarily net interest income fees and commissions and other revenue jpmorgan chase did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002 on firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges jpmorgan chase enters into derivative contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from floatingrate financial instruments and forecasted transactions primarily the rollover of shortterm assets and liabilities and anticipated securities transactions interest rate swaps futures options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common instruments used to reduce the impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes on future earnings all amounts have been included in earnings consistent with the classification of the hedged item primarily net interest income jpmorgan chase primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency–denominated debt instruments to protect the value of its net investments in its nonus subsidiaries in foreign currencies the portion of the hedging instruments excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness forward points is recorded in net interest income the following table presents derivative instrument and hedgingrelated activities for the period indicated   in 2001 the adoption of sfas 133 resulted in an aftertax reduction to net income of 25 million and an aftertax reduction to other comprehensive income of 36 million the impact of reclassifying certain sfas 115 securities from afs to trading was not material at the adoption date due to sfas 133 jpmorgan chase changed certain hedging strategies and elected not to designate some derivatives utilized to manage economic exposure as accounting hedges for example to moderate its use of derivatives the mortgage business began using afs securities as economic hedges of mortgage servicing rights certain interest rate derivatives are recorded in trading revenue due to operational and cost constraints of applying hedge accounting changes in the fair value of credit derivatives used to manage the firm’s credit risk are recorded in trading revenue because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges of loans and commitments prior to the adoption of sfas 133 derivatives used for hedging purposes generally were not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the unrealized gains and losses were deferred on those contracts note 29 offbalance sheet lendingrelated financial instruments and guarantees jpmorgan chase utilizes lendingrelated financial instruments eg commitments and guarantees to meet the financing needs of its customers the contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment or the firm fulfill its obligation under the guarantee and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of the contract most of these commitments and guarantees expire without a default occurring or without being drawn as a result the total contractual amount of these instruments is not in the firm’s view representative of the firm’s actual future credit exposure or funding requirements further certain commitments primarily related to consumer financings are cancelable upon notice at the option of the firm to provide for the risk of loss inherent in commercialrelated contracts an allowance for credit losses is maintained see note 10 for a further discussion on the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the following table summarizes the contract amounts relating to offbalance sheet lendingrelated financial instruments and guarantees at december 31 2002 and 2001 offbalance sheet lendingrelated financial instruments      in november 2002 the fasb issued fin 45 which requires the firm to disclose information about obligations under certain guarantee arrangements fin 45 defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the firm to pay a guaranteed party based on a changes in an underlying asset liability or equity security of the guaranteed party or b a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement the firm considers the following offbalance sheet lending arrangements to be guarantees under fin 45 certain asset purchase agreements standby letters of credit and financial guarantees and securities lending indemnifications unfunded commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend only when a customer has complied with predetermined conditions and they generally expire on fixed dates the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments includes 213 million at december 31 2002 related to unfunded commitments to extend credit the majority of the firm’s unfunded commitments are not guarantees as defined in fin 45 except for asset purchase agreements of 36 billion at december 31 2002 these agreements are primarily used as a mechanism to provide liquidity to spes of the 36 billion of asset purchase agreements at december 31 2002 33 billion related to the firm’s multiseller conduits and structured commercial loan vehicles described in note 11 certain asset purchase agreements can be exercised at anytime by the spe’s administrator while others require a triggering event to occur triggering events include but are not limited to a need for liquidity a market value decline of the assets or downgrade in the rating of jpmorgan chase bank these agreements may cause the firm to purchase an asset from the spe at an amount above the asset’s fair value in effect providing a guarantee of the initial value of the reference asset as of the date of the agreement in most instances thirdparty credit enhancements of the spe mitigate the firm’s potential losses on these agreements the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments related to these agreements was not material at december 31 2002 standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by jpmorgan chase to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under borrowing arrangements such as commercial paper facilities bond financings and similar transactions more than 90 of these arrangements mature within three years the firm typically has recourse to recover from the customer any amounts paid under these guarantees in addition the firm may hold cash or other highly liquid collateral to support these guarantees collateral held at december 31 2002 relating to these arrangements was 8 billion the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments included 150 million related to standby letters of credit and financial guarantees jpmorgan chase holds customers’ securities under custodial arrangements at times these securities are loaned to third parties and the firm issues securities lending indemnification agreements to the customer that protect the customer against the risk of loss if the third party fails to return the securities to support these indemnification agreements jpmorgan chase generally obtains from the third party cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100 of the value of the loaned securities at december 31 2002 the firm held 110 billion in collateral in support of these agreements in connection with issuing securities to investors the firm may enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that may require the firm to make a payment to them in the event of a change in tax law or an adverse interpretation of tax law in certain of these cases the contract may also include a termination clause which would allow the firm to settle the contract at its fair value thus not requiring the firm to make a payment under the indemnification agreement even without the termination clause management does not expect such indemnification agreements to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of jpmorgan chase the firm may also enter into indemnification clauses when it sells a business or assets to a third party pursuant to which it indemnifies that third party for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the firm prior to the sale it is difficult to estimate the firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax laws and future claims that may be made against the firm that have not yet occurred however based on historical experience management expects the risk of loss to be remote in addition to the contracts described above there are certain derivative contracts to which the firm is a counterparty that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under fin 45 these derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value these contracts include written put options that require the firm to purchase assets from the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future as well as derivatives that effectively guarantee the return on a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets the total notional value of the derivatives that the firm deems to be guarantees was 47 billion at december 31 2002 the firm reduces its exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to these contracts the fair value related to these contracts was a derivative receivable of 141 million and a derivative payable of 814 million at december 31 2002 finally certain written put options and credit derivatives permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder or the buyer of credit protection to own the reference asset the firm does not consider these contracts to be guarantees as described in fin 45    notes

note 30 credit risk concentrations concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit risk portfolio to assess potential concentration risks and to obtain collateral when deemed necessary in the firm’s commercial portfolio risk concentrations are primarily evaluated by industry and also by geographic region in the consumer portfolio concentrations are primarily evaluated by product and by us geographic region for further information regarding onbalance sheet credit concentrations by major product and geography see note 9 on page 80 for information regarding concentrations of offbalance sheet lendingrelated financial instruments by major product see note 29 on page 102 more information about concentrations can be found on the following tables in the mda  the table below presents both onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet commercial and consumerrelated credit exposure as of december 31 2002 and 2001   note 31 fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined as the value at which positions could be closed out or sold in a transaction with a willing and knowledgeable counterparty over a period of time consistent with jpmorgan chase’s trading or investment strategy the accounting for an asset or liability may differ based on the type of instrument andor its use in a trading or investing strategy generally the measurement framework recorded in financial statements is one of the following  fair value is based on quoted market prices where available if listed prices or quotes are not available fair value is based on internally developed models that primarily use marketbased or independent information as inputs primary market prices are used to determine the fair value of certain of the firm’s financial instruments such as loans and lendingrelated commitments as they provide an estimate of prices at which such financial instruments could currently be originated valuation adjustments are made at times based on defined methodologies that are applied consistently over time and that are intended to ensure that positions are carried at the best estimate of fair value valuation adjustments include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality liquidity and concentration concerns and ongoing servicing costs jpmorgan chase’s valua jp morgan chase  co  2002 annual report 104   tion process is continually subject to review which includes valuation model and methodology reviews and price testing with independent sources where appropriate these methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values furthermore the use of different methodologies or secondary market prices to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date for example the cost of credit derivatives can be used to estimate the fair value of commercial loans and lendingrelated commitments rather than discounting them using primary market rates following such an approach the fair value of the firm’s commercial loans would approximate carrying value ie commercial loans net of the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2002 following the same approach the maximum incremental depreciation in fair value of the firm’s commercial lendingrelated commitments would be approximately 40 basis points of the total notional amount of these commitments at december 31 2002 certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the scope of sfas 107 accordingly the fair value disclosures required by sfas 107 provide only a partial estimate of the fair value of jpmorgan chase for example jpmorgan chase has developed longterm relationships with its customers through its deposit base and its credit card accounts commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships in the opinion of management these items in the aggregate add significant value to jpmorgan chase but their fair value is not disclosed in this note the following captions describe the methodologies and assumptions used by financial instrument to determine fair value financial assets assets for which fair value approximates carrying value fair values of certain financial assets carried at cost including cash and due from banks deposits with banks securities borrowed shortterm receivables and accrued interest receivable are considered to approximate their respective carrying values due to their shortterm nature and generally negligible credit risk assets where fair value differs from cost jpmorgan chase’s debt equity and derivative trading instruments are carried at their estimated fair value quoted market prices when available are used to determine the fair value of trading instruments if quoted market prices are not available then fair values are estimated by using pricing models quoted prices of instruments with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements are typically shortterm in nature and as such for a significant majority of the firm’s transactions cost approximates carrying value this balance sheet item also includes structured resale agreements and similar products with longdated maturities to estimate the fair value of these instruments the cash flows are discounted using the appropriate market rates for the applicable maturity securities fair values of activelytraded securities are determined by the secondary market while the fair values for nonactively traded securities are based on independent broker quotations derivatives fair value for derivatives is determined based on the following  loans fair value for loans is determined using methodologies suitable for each type of loan

the fair value methodology of private equity investments see note 13 on page 88 fair value for mortgage servicing rights is estimated using a discounted future cash flow model that considers portfolio characteristics and assumptions regarding prepayment speeds delinquency rates ancillary revenues and other economic factors the firm reviews such assumptions against market comparables if available financial liabilities liabilities for which fair value approximates carrying value sfas 107 requires that the fair value disclosed for deposit liabilities with no stated maturity ie demand savings and certain money market deposits be equal to their carrying value sfas 107 does not allow for the recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments fair value of commercial paper other borrowed funds accounts payable and accrued liabilities is considered to approximate their respective carrying values due to their shortterm nature interestbearing deposits fair values of interestbearing deposits are estimated by discounting cash flows based on contractual maturities of funds having similar interest rates and similar maturities federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements are typically shortterm in nature and as such for a significant majority of the firm’s transactions cost approximates carrying value this balance sheet item also includes structured repurchase agreements and similar products with longdated maturities to estimate the fair value of these instruments the cash flows are discounted using the appropriate market rates for the applicable maturity longterm debtrelated instruments fair value for longterm debt including the guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the firm’s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures is based on current market rates and is adjusted for jpmorgan chase’s credit quality lendingrelated commitments the firm estimates the fair value of its commitments to extend credit based on the primary market prices to originate new commitments at december 31 2002 it is the change in current primary market prices relative to the original prices that provides the estimate of the fair value of these commitments on this basis the fair value of the firm’s lendingrelated commitments approximated the allowance for lendingrelated commitments of 363 million at december 31 2002 the following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial assets and
