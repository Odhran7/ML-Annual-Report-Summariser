products 



deposition processes and product families 

deposition processes create layers of dielectric insulating and metal conducting materials used to build a semiconductor device depending on the type of material and structure being made different techniques are employed electrochemical deposition creates the copper wiring interconnect that links devices in an integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” plating of copper and other metals is also used for tsv and wlp applications tiny tungsten connectors and thin barriers are made with the precision of chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition which adds only a few layers of atoms at a time plasmaenhanced cvd highdensity plasma cvd and ald are used to form the critical insulating layers that isolate and protect all of these electrical structures lastly postdeposition treatments such as ultraviolet thermal processing are used to improve dielectric film properties 

altus ® product family 

tungsten deposition is used to form conductive features such as contacts vias and wordlines on a chip these features are small often narrow and use only a small amount of metal so minimizing resistance and achieving complete fill can be difficult at these nanoscale dimensions even slight imperfections can impact device performance or cause a chip to fail our altus ® systems combine cvd and ald technologies to deposit the highly conformal films needed for advanced tungsten metallization applications the multistation sequential deposition architecture enables nucleation layer formation and bulk cvdald fill to be performed in the same chamber “in situ” our ald technologies are used in the deposition of barrier films to achieve high step coverage with reduced thickness at lower temperatures relative to a conventional process 

sabre ® product family 

copper deposition lays down the electrical wiring for most semiconductor devices even the smallest defect  say a microscopic pinhole or dust particle  in these conductive structures can impact device performance from loss of speed to complete failure the sabre ® ecd product family which helped pioneer the copper interconnect transition offers the precision needed for copper damascene manufacturing in logic and memory system capabilities include cobalt deposition for logic applications and copper deposition directly on various liner materials which is important for nextgeneration metallization schemes for advanced wlp applications such as forming conductive bumps and redistribution layers and for filling tsvs the sabre ® 3d family combines lam’s sabre electrofill ® technology with additional innovation to deliver the highquality films needed at high productivity the modular architecture can be configured with multiple plating and preposttreatment cells providing flexibility to address a variety of packaging applications 

sola ® product family

speed ® product family 

dielectric gapfill processes deposit critical insulation layers between conductive andor active areas by filling openings of various aspect ratios between conducting lines and between devices with advanced devices the structures being filled can be very tall and narrow as a result highquality dielectric films are especially important due to the everincreasing possibility of crosstalk and device failure our speed ® hdpcvd products provide a multiple dielectric film solution for highquality gapfill with industryleading throughput and reliability speed ® products have excellent particle performance and their design allows large batch sizes between cleans and faster cleans 

striker ® product family 

the latest memory logic and imaging devices require extremely thin highly conformal dielectric films for continued device performance improvement and scaling for example ald films are critical for spacerbased multiple patterning schemes where the spacers help define critical dimensions as well as for insulating liners and gapfill in high aspect ratio features which have little tolerance for voids and even the smallest defect the striker ® singlewafer ald products provide dielectric film solutions for these challenging requirements through applicationspecific material process and hardware options that deliver film technology and defect performance 

vector ® product family 

dielectric film deposition processes are used to form some of the most difficulttoproduce insulating layers in a semiconductor device including those used in the latest transistors and 3d structures in some applications these films require dielectric films to be exceptionally smooth and defect free since slight imperfections are multiplied greatly in subsequent layers our vector ® pecvd products are designed to provide the performance and flexibility needed to create these enabling structures within a wide range of challenging device applications as a result of its design vector ® produces superior thin film quality along with exceptional withinwafer and wafertowafer uniformity 

etch processes and product families 

etch processes help create chip features by selectively removing dielectric insulating metal silicon and poly silicon conductingsemiconducting materials that have been added during deposition these processes involve fabricating increasingly small complex and narrow features using many types of materials the primary technology reactive ion etch bombards the wafer surface with ions charged particles to remove material for the smallest features atomiclayer etching “ale” removes a few atomic layers of material at a time while conductor etch processes precisely shape critical electrical components like transistors dielectric etch forms the insulating structures that protect conducting parts 

flex ® product family 

dielectric etch carves patterns in insulating materials to create barriers between the electrically conductive parts of a semiconductor device for advanced devices these structures can be extremely tall and thin and involve complex sensitive materials slight deviations from the target feature profile  even at the atomic level  can negatively affect electrical properties of the device to precisely create these challenging structures our flex ® product family offers differentiated technologies and applicationfocused capabilities for critical dielectric etch applications uniformity repeatability and tunability are enabled by a unique multifrequency smallvolume confined plasma design flex ® offers in situ multistep etch and continuous plasma capability that delivers high productivity with low defectivity 

kiyo ® product family 

conductor etch helps shape the electrically active materials used in the parts of a semiconductor device even a slight variation in these miniature structures can degrade device performance in fact these structures are so tiny and sensitive that etch processes push the boundaries of the basic laws of physics and chemistry our kiyo ® product family delivers the highperformance capabilities needed to precisely and consistently form these features precisely and with high productivity proprietary hydra technology in kiyo ® products improves critical dimension “cd” uniformity by correcting for incoming pattern variability and atomicscale variability control with productionworthy throughput is achieved with plasmaenhanced ale capability 

syndion ® product family 

plasma etch processes used to remove single crystal silicon and other materials deep into the wafer are collectively referred to as deep silicon etch these may be deep trenches for cmos image sensors trenches for power and other devices tsvs and other high aspect ratio features these are created by etching through multiple materials sequentially where each new material involves a change in the etch process the syndion ® etch product family is optimized for deep silicon etch providing the fast process switching with depth and crosswafer uniformity control required to achieve precision etch results the systems support both conventional singlestep etch and rapidly alternating process which minimizes damage and delivers precise depth uniformity

clean processes and product families 

clean techniques are used between manufacturing steps to clear away particles contaminants residues and other unwanted material that could later lead to defects and to prepare the wafer surface for subsequent processing wet processing technologies can be used for wafer cleaning and etch applications plasma bevel cleaning is used to enhance die yield by removing unwanted materials from the wafer’s edge that could impact the device area 

coronus ® product family 

bevel cleaning removes unwanted masks residues and films from the edge of a wafer between manufacturing steps if not cleaned these materials become defect sources for instance they can flake off and redeposit on the device area during subsequent processes even a single particle that lands on a critical part of a device can ruin the entire chip by inserting bevel clean processes at strategic points these potential defect sources can be eliminated and more functional chips produced by combining the precise control and flexibility of plasma with technology that protects the active die area the coronus ® bevel clean family cleans the wafer’s edge to enhance die yield the systems provide active die area protection by using plasma processing with proprietary confinement technology applications include postetch pre and postdeposition prelithography and metal film removal to prevent arcing during plasma etch or deposition steps 

dvprime ®  da vinci ®  eos ®  and sp series product families 

wafer cleaning is performed repeatedly during semiconductor device manufacturing and is a critical process that affects product yield and reliability unwanted microscopic materials  some no bigger than the tiny structures themselves  need to be cleaned effectively at the same time these processes must selectively remove residues that are chemically similar to the device films for advanced wlp the wet clean steps used between processes that form the package and external wiring have surprisingly complex requirements these processes are called on to completely remove specific materials and leave other fragile structures undisturbed in iot products that include power devices mems and image sensors there is a unique requirement for wafer backside wet etch to uniformly thin the silicon wafer while protecting the device side of the wafer 

based on our pioneering singlewafer spin technology the dvprime ® and da vinci ® products provide the process flexibility needed with high productivity to address a wide range of wafer cleaning steps throughout the manufacturing process flow as the latest of lam’s wet clean products eos ® delivers exceptionally low onwafer defectivity and high throughput to address progressively demanding wafer cleaning applications with a broad range of process capability our sp series products deliver costefficient productionproven wet clean and silicon wet etch solutions for challenging wlp and iot applications

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k “2022 form 10k” the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition many of the following risk factors have been and could be further exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result as a result of these risk factors as well as other 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 12 

risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended by nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

industry and customer risks 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and periods of rapid growth or decline we therefore face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand the industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities 

during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures for training assimilating and managing our workforce and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted for example the covid19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand for our products due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines shelter in place or “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the pandemic 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity and resources too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment resulting in excess fixed costs 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits with the consolidation of customers within the industry the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers the economic political and business conditions occurring nationally globally or in any of our key sales regions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result changing economic political or business conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

• a decline in demand for our products or services 

• an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers’ inability to pay us 

• an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory 

• valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 

• restructuring charges 

• asset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

• a decline in the value of our investments 

• exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition 

• a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor and 

• challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply 

fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues operating results and earnings where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 13 

reduced revenues we must continue to invest in rd and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments cash flows collections and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us compliance with specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and limitations on our ability to share technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry as well as the emergence and strengthening of new regional competitors we may face increasing competitive pressures other companies continue to develop systems andor acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers’ needs to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd technological changes and developing technologies have required and are expected to continue to require new and costly investments certain of our competitors including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products andor product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours in addition we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match in many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products or existing products have reliability quality design or safety problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace for more than 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver could be approaching its technological limit leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development in addition the emergence of “big data” and new tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence that capitalize on the availability of large data sets is leading semiconductor manufacturers and equipment manufacturers to pursue new products and approaches that exploit 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 14 

those tools to advance technology development in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies to invest in or acquire such business or technologies and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us we may find that acquisitions are not available to us for regulatory or other reasons and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions pursuing development through collaboration andor joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management including those related to aligning business objectives sharing confidential information intellectual property and data sharing value with third parties and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with nextgeneration devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers reevaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors’ products andor gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data 

similarly our customers may partner with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select our equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

business and operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

the covid19 pandemic and efforts by national state and local governments worldwide to control its spread have resulted in widespread measures aimed at containing the disease such as quarantines travel bans shutdowns and shelter in place or “stay at home” orders which collectively have significantly restricted the movement of people and goods and the ability of businesses to operate these restrictions and measures incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees customers and suppliers have affected and are affecting our business and operations by among other things causing facility closures production delays and capacity limitations disrupting production by our supply chain disrupting the transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers requiring modifications to our business processes requiring the implementation of business continuity plans requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes disrupting business travel disrupting our ability to staff our onsite manufacturing and research and development facilities delaying capital expansion projects and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce these impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause delays in product shipments and product development increases in costs and decreases in revenue profitability and cash from operations which have caused and are expected to cause an adverse effect on our results of operations that may be material the potential duration and impact of the pandemic on the global economy and on our business are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty but the pandemic has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets increases in levels of unemployment and economic uncertainty which has adversely impacted our business and may continue to do so and may lead to significant negative 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 15 

impacts on customer spending demand for our products the ability of our customers to pay our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers and our access to external sources of financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures 

our revenues and operating results are variable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter or year factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

• economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry 

• the size and timing of orders from customers 

• changes in our deferred revenue balance including as a result of factors such as volume purchase agreements multiyear service contracts back orders and down payments toward purchases 

• consolidation of the customer base which may result in the investment decisions of one customer or market having a significant effect on demand for our products or services 

• procurement shortages 

• the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations 

• manufacturing difficulties 

• customer cancellations or delays in shipments installations customer payments andor customer acceptances 

• the extent that customers continue to purchase and use our products and services in their business 

• our customers’ reuse of existing and installed products to the extent that such reuse decreases their need to purchase new products or services 

• changes in average selling prices customer mix and product mix 

• our ability to develop introduce and market new enhanced and competitive products in a timely manner 

• our competitors’ introduction of new products 

• legal or technical challenges to our products and technologies 

• transportation communication demand information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as strikes acts of god wars terrorist activities widespread outbreak of illness natural or manmade disasters or climate change 

• legal tax accounting or regulatory changes including but not limited to changes in importexport regulations and tariffs or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements 

• changes in our estimated effective tax rate and 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

for example the covid19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand for our products due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines shelter in place or “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the pandemic 

disruptions to our supply chain and outsource providers could impact our ability to meet demand increase our costs and adversely impact our revenue and operating results 

our supply chain has played and will continue to play a key role in our product development manufacturing operations field installation and support our business depends on our timely supply of products and services to meet the demand from our customers which depends in significant part on the timely delivery of parts materials and services including components and subassemblies from our direct suppliers to us and to our direct suppliers by other companies in addition outsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role both in the manufacturing and customerfocused operations described above and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect we may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations delays in our ability to deliver or install products or perform services or to recognize revenue increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of 

• the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a costeffective basis 

• volatility in the availability and cost of parts materials or services including increased costs due to rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions 

• difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals 

• shipment delays and increased costs of shipment due to transportation interruptions capacity constraints or fuel shortages 

• shortages of semiconductor or other components or materials as a result of increases in demand 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 16 

• information technology or infrastructure failures including those of a thirdparty supplier or service provider and 

• transportation or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as strikes acts of god wars terrorist activities widespread outbreak of illness natural or manmade disasters or climate change 

demand for electronic products and other factors such as the covid19 pandemic and the conflict in ukraine have resulted in and may continue to result in a shortage of parts materials and services needed to manufacture deliver and install our products as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions such shortages delays and unpredictability have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts materials or services and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our manufacturing operations and our ability to meet customer demand in addition difficulties in obtaining parts materials or services necessary to deliver or install products or perform services have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our ability to recognize revenue our gross margins on the revenue we recognize and our other operating results although we are endeavoring to pass along some of the impact of increased costs to our customers to counteract adverse impacts to our gross margins and other operating results such measures could be unsuccessful or could have the effect of reducing demand which would adversely impact our revenue 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances some key parts are subject to long leadtimes or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where we conduct our manufacturing there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships for example the covid–19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations supply chain and customer support due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines stay at home orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the pandemic 

our business relies on technology data intellectual property and other sensitive information that is susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents 

our business is dependent upon the use and protection of technology data intellectual property and other sensitive information which may be owned by or licensed to us or third parties such as our customers and vendors we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the creation transmission use and storage of much of this information and for the effective operation of our business these information systems include but are not limited to telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors contractors customers and cloud providers in addition we make use of softwareasaservice saas products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers or thirdparty networks and servers all of which rely on networks email andor the internet for their function 

the technology data intellectual property and other sensitive information we seek to protect are subject to loss release misappropriation or misuse and the information systems containing or transmitting such technology data intellectual property and other sensitive information are subject to disruption breach or failure in each case as a result of various possible causes such causes may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors phishing schemes and other thirdparty attacks and degradation or loss of service or access to data due to viruses malware denial of service attacks destructive or inadequate code power failures or physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines or networking equipment such causes may also include the use of techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time 

we have experienced cybersecurity and other threats and incidents in the past although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect we may incur material losses related to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents in the future if we were subject to a cybersecurity or other incident it could have a material adverse effect on our business such adverse effects might include 

• loss of or inability to access eg through ransomware confidential andor sensitive information stored on these critical information systems or transmitted to or from those systems 

• the disruption of the proper function of our products services andor operations 

• the failure of our or our customers’ manufacturing processes 

• errors in the output of our work or our customers’ work 

• the loss or public exposure of the personal or other confidential information of our employees customers or other parties 

• the public release of customer financial and business plans customer orders and operational results 

• exposure to claims from our employees or third parties who are adversely impacted by such incidents 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 17 

• misappropriation or theft of our or a customer’s supplier’s or other party’s assets or resources including technology data intellectual property or other sensitive information and costs associated therewith 

• reputational damage 

• diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering or 

• our failure to meet or violation of regulatory or other legal obligations such as the timely publication or filing of financial statements tax information and other required communications 

while we have implemented iso 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software intrusion prevention systems identity and access control and emergency recovery processes and we carefully select our thirdparty providers of information systems to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on and to the technology data intellectual property and other sensitive information we seek to protect those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents it has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen in addition there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks threats and incidents in a timely manner or at all or to respond expediently appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales as reflected in part ii item 7 results of operation of this 2022 form 10k accounted for approximately 92 94 and 92 of total revenue in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

• domestic and international trade regulations policies practices relations disputes and issues 

• domestic and international tariffs export controls and other barriers 

• developing customers andor suppliers who may have limited access to capital resources 

• global or national economic and political conditions 

• changes in currency controls 

• differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions 

• our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems spare parts and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers 

• changes in and compliance with us and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations including us and international trade restrictions and sanctions antibribery anticorruption antiboycott environmental tax and labor laws 

• fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 

• the need for technical support resources in different locations and 

• our ability to secure and retain qualified people and effectively manage people in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business 

for example the covid19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations supply chain and customer support due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines stay at home orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the pandemic 

there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china japan korea taiwan and the united states that political diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes impacts andor disruptions in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry this would adversely affect our business with china japan korea andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region or global economy a significant trade dispute impact andor disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

tariffs export controls additional taxes trade barriers sanctions or the termination or modification of trade agreements trade zones and other duty mitigation initiatives may increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions certain of our international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us or foreign governments and our inability to obtain such licenses or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues as is discussed below under the heading “our sales to customers in china a region of growing significance to us could be materially and adversely affected by export license requirements and other regulatory changes or other governmental actions in the course of the trade relationship between the us and china” the us government has recently expanded export license requirements that impact trade with china in addition the us government is in the process of assessing technologies that may be subject to new or additional export controls and it is possible that such controls if and when imposed could adversely impact our ability to sell our products outside the us furthermore there are risks that foreign governments may among other things insist on the use of local suppliers compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights andor local manufacturing utilize their influence over their judicial systems to 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 18 

respond to intellectual property disputes or issues and provide special incentives to governmentbacked local customers to buy from local competitors even if their products are inferior to ours all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins 

we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro korean won malaysian ringgit and indian rupee currently we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro korean won malaysian ringgit and indian rupee in addition we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily thirdparty accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in these currencies 

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes can usually only be made with onshore cash balances since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes 

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing and rd facilities 

while we maintain business continuity plans our manufacturing and rd facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or manmade disasters widespread outbreaks of illness terrorist activities political or governmental unrest or instability disruptions of our information technology resources utility interruptions the effects of climate change or other events beyond our control such disruptions may cause delays in developing or shipping our products in engaging with customers on new product applications or in supporting customers which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results for example the covid19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations supply chain rd and customer support due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the pandemic 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products our products are priced up to the tens of millions of dollars per system as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

• a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products 

• a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products 

• export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets 

• an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate 

• increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines 

• increased pressure from regional competitors 

• technological changes that we are unable to address with our products or 

• a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 

in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products andor product capabilities including new products that take advantage of “big data” or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights trade secrets and other forms of protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 19 

strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques confidential andor as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the us or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees additionally intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the united states or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages moreover because we selectively file for patent protection in different jurisdictions we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills experiences and competencies this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions as well as increasing geographic expansion and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs global economic or political and industry conditions our organizational structure global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees the availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability enhance our technological capabilities or accomplish other strategic objectives as a result we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies for regulatory or other reasons we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses products or technologies resulting in significant financial costs reduced or lost opportunities and diversion of management’s attention managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock 

legal regulatory and tax risks 

our sales to customers in china a region of growing significance to us could be materially and adversely affected by export license requirements and other regulatory changes or other governmental actions in the course of the trade relationship between the us and china 

china represents a large and fastdeveloping market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to our business revenue in china which includes global customers and domestic chinese customers with manufacturing facilities in china represented approximately 31 35 and 31 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the us and china have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the two countries recently these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the us government which have limited the market for our products adversely impacted our revenues and increased our exposure to foreign competition and could potentially do so to an even greater extent in the future for example since the start of calendar year 2020 the us department of commerce enacted a new rule that expanded export license requirements for us companies to sell certain items to companies and other endusers in china that are designated as military endusers or have operations that could support military enduses added additional chinese companies to its restricted entity list under suspicions of militarycivil fusion support of russia or other factors associated with a broadening scope of national security concerns including semiconductor manufacturing international

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate 2 disagreements or disputes related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to export controls financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials antiboycott compliance conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation immigration or travel regulations antitrust regulations and laws or regulations relating to carbon emissions as well as other laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns among others each of these laws rules and regulations imposes costs on our business including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance and may present risks to our business including potential fines restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we do not fully comply 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in reduced operating income and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition andor results of operations could be adversely affected 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement misappropriation unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other thirdparty claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income transaction and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities the amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states

on august 16 2022 the inflation reduction act the “ira” was signed into law in general the provisions of the ira will be effective beginning with our fiscal year 2024 with certain exceptions the ira includes a new 15 corporate minimum tax as well as a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases applicable to repurchases after december 31 2022 we are in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of the ira while we do not currently expect the ira to have a material impact on our effective tax rate our analysis is ongoing and incomplete and it is possible that the ira could have a material adverse effect on our tax liability 

recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting project have the potential to lead to changes in the tax laws in numerous countries in addition president joseph biden has made several corporate income tax proposals including a significant increase to the us corporate income tax rate and changes in the taxation of nonus income if enacted such changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to undertake remediation activities suspend production andor cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations acquire significant additional equipment incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations or take other actions any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

our bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive judicial forum for certain legal actions between the company and its stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims 

our bylaws provide that unless we consent otherwise the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for lawsuits asserting certain stockholder claims including claims asserted derivatively for our benefit such as claims against directors and officers for breach of a fiduciary duty claims arising under any provision of the general corporation law of delaware or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine this is a general summary of the bylaw provision you should refer to the language of the bylaws for details while the forum provision does not generally apply to direct claims arising under the securities exchange act of 1934 or the securities act of 1933 derivative lawsuits that assert legal claims arising under these statutes could fall within the provision as recent court decisions have held 

as a delaware corporation delaware law controls issues of our internal affairs including duties that our directors officers employees and others owe to the company and its stockholders we believe that our exclusive forum provision benefits us and our stockholders by permitting relatively prompt resolution of lawsuits concerning our internal affairs promoting consistent application of delaware law in these lawsuits and reducing the possibility of duplicative costly multijurisdictional litigation with the potential for inconsistent outcomes however the forum provision limits a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes may be more favorable than delaware and this could discourage the filing of such lawsuits 

financial accounting and capital markets risks 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions or may subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

• general market semiconductor or semiconductor equipment industry conditions 

• economic or political events trends and unexpected developments occurring nationally globally or in any of our key sales regions 

• variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition including our liquidity 

• variations in our revenues earnings or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry 

• announcements of restructurings reductions in force departure of key employees andor consolidations of operations 

• margin trading short sales hedging and derivative transactions involving our common stock 

• government regulations 

• developments in or claims relating to patent or other proprietary rights 

• technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors 

• commercial success or failure of our new and existing products or 

• disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers 

in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors these and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 22 

sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

we may incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our goodwill identified in business combinations for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed the fair value we review all other longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that these assets may not be recoverable the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets requires significant judgement negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business units could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets 

when evaluating goodwill if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then a quantitative impairment test is performed and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations 

when evaluating other longlived assets if we conclude that the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying value we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations 

our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

we have 50 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding additionally we have funding available to us under our 15 billion commercial paper program and our 15 billion revolving credit facility which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional 6000 million for a potential total commitment of 21 billion we may in the future decide to enter into additional debt arrangements 

in addition we have entered and in the future may enter into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments 

our indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

• risk associated with the alternative reference rate reform eg libor transition 

• risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations 

• a portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations working capital capital expenditures expansion acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes and 

• impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain and any of our other future similar agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

• incur additional debt assume obligations in connection with letters of credit or issue guarantees 

• create liens 

• enter into transactions with our affiliates 

• sell certain assets and 

• merge or consolidate with any person 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 23 

our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes or our other debt which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014 our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks changes in federal state and international tax laws or corporate laws contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements availability of onshore cash flow and changes to our business model our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

executive summary 

lam research corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry we have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement chemistry plasma and fluidics advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products including mobile phones personal computers servers wearables automotive vehicles and data storage devices 

our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory foundry and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as nvm dram and logic devices their continued success is part of our commitment to driving semiconductor breakthroughs that define the next generation our core technical competency is integrating hardware process materials software and process control enabling results on the wafer 

semiconductor manufacturing our customers’ business involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer this involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale along with meeting technical requirements wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be costeffective 

demand from cloud computing the iot and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost  efficient semiconductors at the same time there are growing technical challenges with traditional twodimensional scaling these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like threedimensional architecture as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks 

we believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and expertise in deposition  etch and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing our customer support business group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance predictability and operational efficiency several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us i our focus on research and development with several ongoing programs relating to sustaining engineering product and process development and concept and feasibility ii our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base iii our collaborative focus with semiecosystem partners iv our ability to identify and invest in the breadth of our product portfolio to meet technology inflections and v our focus on delivering our multiproduct solutions with a goal to enhance the value of lam’s solutions to our customers 

wafer fabrication equipment spending was strong throughout the 2022 fiscal year driven by increasing device manufacturing complexity and the robust secular demand for semiconductors for nand dram and foundry logic markets over the longer term we believe that secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable growth for our products and services and that technology inflections in our industry including 3d device scaling multiple patterning process flow and advanced packaging chip integration will lead to an increase in the served addressable market for our products and services in the deposition etch and clean businesses during fiscal year 2022 customer demand remained solid however ongoing supply chain constraints broadened during the period and impacted our ability to fulfill demand while we have seen improvements in both our operations and those of our suppliers we expect supply shortages as well as inflationary cost pressures to persist in at least the near term risks and 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 28 

uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic broadening supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures may continue to negatively impact our revenue and gross margin 

the following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below 



fiscal year 2022 revenue increased over 17 compared to fiscal year 2021 reflecting continued strong customer demand for semiconductor equipment gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due to inflationary cost pressures that led to higher spending on material costs freight and logistics and laborrelated expenses as well as unfavorable customer and product mix partially offset by decreased variable compensation the increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was mainly driven by higher employeerelated costs as a result of increased headcount supplies expense rent repair and utilities expense and outside services spending partially offset by lower deferred compensation planrelated costs 

fiscal year 2021 revenue increased approximately 46 compared to fiscal year 2020 reflecting stronger customer demand for semiconductor equipment gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to customer and product mix partially offset by higher costs incurred in freight and logistics as well as startup expenses for our new malaysia manufacturing facility the increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was mainly driven by higher employeerelated costs as a result of increased headcount and outsourcing services deferred compensation planrelated costs and supplies partially offset by lower travel expenses and miscellaneous costs 

our cash and cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 39 billion as of june 26 2022 compared to 60 billion as of june 27 2021 cash flow provided from operating activities was 31 billion for fiscal year 2022 compared to 36 billion for fiscal year 2021 cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2022 was primarily used for 39 billion in treasury stock purchases including net share settlement on employee stockbased compensation 815 million in dividends paid to our stockholders and 546 million of capital expenditures these cash outflows were partially offset by 114 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equitybased compensation programs 

results of operations 

revenue 



revenue increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal years 2021 and 2020 primarily due to the increased investment by our customers in semiconductor capital equipment as well as higher revenue from our customer support business group for spares services upgrades and mature node equipment the overall asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity investments for semiconductor manufacturing continued to occur in this region 

the deferred revenue balance was 22 billion as of june 26 2022 compared to 11 billion as of june 27 2021 driven by additional deferrals related to tools pending full delivery and future servicing of our existing installed base

the percentage of leading and nonleadingedge equipment and upgrade revenue from each of the markets we serve was as follows   



gross margin 



the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was due to inflationary cost pressures that led to higher spending on material costs freight and logistics and laborrelated expenses as well as unfavorable customer and product mix partially offset by decreased variable compensation 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily related to customer and product mix partially offset by increased spending on freight and logistics due in significant part to covid19 disruptions startup expenses for our malaysia manufacturing facility and deferred compensation planrelated costs 

research and development 



we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge deposition etch clean and other semiconductor manufacturing processes the increase i n rd expense during fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was mainly driven by an increase of 89 million in employeerelated costs due in part to increased headcount and 43 million in spending for supplies partially offset by a decrease of 44 million in deferred compensation planrelated costs 

the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was mainly driven by an increase of 137 million in employeerelated costs due in part to increased headcount 49 million in outside service costs 32 million in deferred compensation planrelated costs and 27 million in spending for supplies

selling general and administrative 



the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by an increase of 28 million in outside service costs 28 million in spending for rent repair and utilities and 26 million in employeerelated costs due in part to increased headcount partially offset by a decrease of 29 million in deferred compensation planrelated costs 

the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a 97 million increase in employeerelated costs due in part to increased headcount 37 million in outside service costs and 21 million in deferred compensation planrelated costs partially offset by a 9 million decrease in travel and entertainment costs 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 



interest income decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 as a result of lower cash balances interest income decreased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 as a result of lower yield 

interest expense decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the payoff of 800 million of our notes in june 2021 interest expense increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily due to the fullyear impact of the issuance of 20 billion senior notes in fiscal year 2020 

the gains or losses on deferred compensation plan related assets net in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 were driven by fluctuations in the fair market value of the underlying funds 

the variation in other net for the fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was primarily driven by fluctuations in the fair market value of equity investments 

income tax expense 

our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows 



the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the change in level and proportion of income in higher and lower tax jurisdictions 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 31 

the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020 as outlined below 

in november 2019 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit “ninth circuit” rejected the en banc appeal petitioned by altera corporation “altera” in july 2019 in that quarter we evaluated the impact of the decision and viewed the denial as an indication that altera’s position of excluding stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement was unlikely to be sustained upon further litigation as a result we reversed 75 million of net tax assets associated with stockbased compensation benefits related to previous years in the condensed consolidated financial statements in the three months ended december 29 2019 and we no longer reflected a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to excluding stockbased compensation from our intercompany costsharing arrangement in february 2020 altera petitioned the supreme court of the united states scotus to hear their case in june 2020 the scotus denied the petition 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states international pretax income is taxable in the united states at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate please refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2022 form 10k 

a provision enacted as part of the 2017 tax cuts  jobs act requires companies to capitalize research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes in tax years beginning after december 31 2021 our fiscal year 2023 if this provision is not repealed or deferred we expect our fiscal year 2023 cash tax payments to increase significantly compared to our fiscal year 2022 

on august 16 2022 the inflation reduction act was signed into law in general the provisions of the ira will be effective beginning with our fiscal year 2024 with certain exceptions the ira includes a new 15 corporate minimum tax we are in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of the ira the impact on income taxes due to changes in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of accounting standard codification “asc” 740 income taxes to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted while we do not currently expect the ira to have a material impact on our effective tax rate our analysis is ongoing and incomplete and it is possible that the ira could have a material adverse effect on our tax liability we will continue to monitor issuance of additional guidance 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets were 1103 million and 772 million at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of 234 million and 187 million and a valuation allowance representing our entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in california of 309 million and 277 million at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively the change in gross deferred tax assets gross deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2022 and 2021 is primarily due to increases in gross deferred tax assets for outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries and tax credits and increases in gross deferred tax liabilities for capital assets 

we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our critical accounting estimates include 

• the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue 

• the valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin 

• the valuation of warranty reserves which impacts gross margin 

• the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes including the measurement of uncertain tax positions which impact our provision for income tax expenses and 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 32 

• the valuation and recoverability of longlived assets which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2022 form 10k for additional information regarding our accounting policies 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a fivestep process 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation as further described below 

identify the contract with a customer  we generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks payment histories andor other circumstances 

identify the performance obligations in the contract  performance obligations include sales of systems spare parts and services in addition our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract 

determine the transaction price  the transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time we generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year 

allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies 

recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation  revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time which is generally upon shipment or delivery revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less 

inventory valuation our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which the revision is made 

warranty we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 33 

longlived assets  we review goodwill at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment when reviewing goodwill for impairment we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in performing a qualitative assessment we consider business conditions and other factors including but not limited to i adverse industry or economic trends ii restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results iii sustained decline in share price and iv overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

if after completing the quantitative assessment the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value up to the amount of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit 

for other longlived assets we review them whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value if the sum is less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset’s carrying value the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value in addition for fully amortized intangible assets we derecognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows 

recent accounting pronouncements

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 39 billion at the end of fiscal year 2022 compared to 60 billion at the end of fiscal year 2021 this decrease was primarily due to common stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program dividends paid and capital expenditures partially offset by cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 31 billion during fiscal year 2022 consisted of in thousands 



significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following uses of cash increases in accounts receivable of 13 billion inventories of 14 billion and prepaid expenses and other assets of 53 million partially offset by the following sources of cash increases in deferred profit of 605 million accounts payable of 168 million and accrued expenses and other liabilities of 123 million 

lam research corporation 2022 10k 34 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2022 was 612 million primarily consisting of net salesmaturities of available for sale securities of 12 billion partially offset by capital expenditures of 546 million 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2022 was 46 billion primarily consisting of 39 billion in common stock repurchases including net share settlement on employee stockbased compensation and 815 million of dividends paid partially offset by 114 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stockbased compensation plans 

liquidity 

given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook combined with our current levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of june 26 2022 are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements capital expenditures capital redistributions and dividends through at least the next twelve months however uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry as well as disruptions in credit markets have in the past and could in the future impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however the ongoing covid19 pandemic has in the past caused disruption in the capital markets and were it to do the same in the future that could make any financing more challenging and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not certain obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap include our longterm debt operating leases and finance leases refer to notes 14 and 15 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2022 form 10k for further discussion our offbalance sheet arrangements and our transition tax liability are presented as purchase obligations refer to note 17 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2022 form 10k for further discussion 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 26 2022 our mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations all of our other investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax

interest rate risk 

fixedincome securities 

our investments in various interestearning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixedincome investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and concentration risk as of june 26 2022 our fixed income securities total 1357 million market changes with hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps with a minimum interest rate of zero bps are not significant 

we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

longterm debt 

as of june 26 2022 we had 50 billion in principal amount of fixedrate longterm debt outstanding with a fair value of 45 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes 

equity price risk 

publicly traded securities 

the values of our investments in publicly traded securities including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans are subject to market price risk as of june 26 2022 our publicly traded securities total 952 million potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 15 or 25 are not significant 

foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollar transactions or cash flows 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily cash thirdparty accounts receivable accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated nonus dollar transactions or cash flows we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months the option contracts include collars an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and notional amounts but with different strike prices these foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain nonusdollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily cash thirdparty accounts receivable accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 26 2022 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent

 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with rule 13a15 of the exchange act in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 26 2022 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of june 26 2022 at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework used by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 26 2022 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm audited the financial statements included in this 2022 form 10k and has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part ii item 8 of this 2022 form 10k 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting

speed ® product family 

dielectric gapfill processes deposit critical insulation layers between conductive andor active areas by filling openings of various aspect ratios between conducting lines and between devices with advanced devices the structures being filled can be very tall and narrow as a result highquality dielectric films are especially important due to the everincreasing possibility of crosstalk and device failure our speed ® hdpcvd products provide a multiple dielectric film solution for highquality gapfill with industryleading throughput and reliability speed ® products have excellent particle performance and their design allows large batch sizes between cleans and faster cleans 

striker ® product family 

the latest memory logic and imaging devices require extremely thin highly conformal dielectric films for continued device performance improvement and scaling for example ald films are critical for spacerbased multiple patterning schemes where the spacers help define critical dimensions as well as for insulating liners and gapfill in high aspect ratio features which have little tolerance for voids and even the smallest defect the striker ® singlewafer ald products provide dielectric film solutions for these challenging requirements through applicationspecific material process and hardware options that deliver film technology and defect performance 

vector ® product family 

dielectric film deposition processes are used to form some of the most difficulttoproduce insulating layers in a semiconductor device including those used in the latest transistors and 3d structures in some applications these films require dielectric films to be exceptionally smooth and defect free since slight imperfections are multiplied greatly in subsequent layers our vector ® pecvd products are designed to provide the performance and flexibility needed to create these enabling structures within a wide range of challenging device applications as a result of its design vector ® produces superior thin film quality along with exceptional withinwafer and wafertowafer uniformity 

etch processes and product families 

etch processes help create chip features by selectively removing dielectric insulating metal silicon and poly silicon conductingsemiconducting materials that have been added during deposition these processes involve fabricating increasingly small complex and narrow features using many types of materials the primary technology reactive ion etch bombards the wafer surface with ions charged particles to remove material for the smallest features atomiclayer etching “ale” removes a few atomic layers of material at a time while conductor etch processes precisely shape critical electrical components like transistors dielectric etch forms the insulating structures that protect conducting parts 

flex ® product family 

dielectric etch carves patterns in insulating materials to create barriers between the electrically conductive parts of a semiconductor device for advanced devices these structures can be extremely tall and thin and involve complex sensitive materials slight deviations from the target feature profile  even at the atomic level  can negatively affect electrical properties of the device to precisely create these challenging structures our flex ® product family offers differentiated technologies and applicationfocused capabilities for critical dielectric etch applications uniformity repeatability and tunability are enabled by a unique multifrequency smallvolume confined plasma design flex ® offers in situ multistep etch and continuous plasma capability that delivers high productivity with low defectivity 

kiyo ® product family 

conductor etch helps shape the electrically active materials used in the parts of a semiconductor device even a slight variation in these miniature structures can create an electrical defect that impacts device performance in fact these structures are so tiny that etch processes are pushing the boundaries of the basic laws of physics and chemistry our kiyo ® product family delivers the highperformance capabilities needed to precisely and consistently form these conductive features with high productivity proprietary hydra technology in kiyo ® products improves critical dimension “cd” uniformity by correcting for incoming pattern variability and atomicscale variability control with productionworthy throughput is achieved with plasmaenhanced ale capability 

syndion ® product family 

plasma etch processes used to remove single crystal silicon and other materials deep into the wafer are collectively referred to as deep silicon etch these may be deep trenches for cmos image sensors trenches for power and other devices tsvs and other high aspect ratio features these are created by etching through multiple materials sequentially where each new material involves a change in the etch process the syndion ® etch product family is optimized for deep silicon etch providing the fast process switching with depth and crosswafer uniformity control required to achieve precision etch results the systems support both conventional singlestep etch and rapidly alternating process which minimizes damage and delivers precise depth uniformity

clean processes and product families 

clean techniques are used between manufacturing steps to clear away particles contaminants residues and other unwanted material that could later lead to defects and to prepare the wafer surface for subsequent processing wet processing technologies can be used for wafer cleaning and etch applications plasma bevel cleaning is used to enhance die yield by removing unwanted materials from the wafer’s edge that could impact the device area 

coronus ® product family 

bevel cleaning removes unwanted masks residues and films from the edge of a wafer between manufacturing steps if not cleaned these materials become defect sources for instance they can flake off and redeposit on the device area during subsequent processes even a single particle that lands on a critical part of a device can ruin the entire chip by inserting bevel clean processes at strategic points these potential defect sources can be eliminated and more functional chips produced by combining the precise control and flexibility of plasma with technology that protects the active die area the coronus ® bevel clean family cleans the wafer’s edge to enhance die yield the systems provide active die area protection by using plasma processing with proprietary confinement technology applications include postetch pre and postdeposition prelithography and metal film removal to prevent arcing during plasma etch or deposition steps 

dvprime ®  da vinci ®  eos ®  and sp series product families 

wafer cleaning is performed repeatedly during semiconductor device manufacturing and is a critical process that affects product yield and reliability unwanted microscopic materials  some no bigger than the tiny structures themselves  need to be cleaned effectively at the same time these processes must selectively remove residues that are chemically similar to the device films for advanced wlp the wet clean steps used between processes that form the package and external wiring have surprisingly complex requirements these processes are called on to completely remove specific materials and leave other fragile structures undisturbed in iot products that include power devices mems and image sensors there is a unique requirement for wafer backside wet etch to uniformly thin the silicon wafer while protecting the device side of the wafer

lam research corporation 2021 10k 12 

industry and customer risks 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and periods of rapid growth or decline we therefore face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand the industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities 

during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures for training assimilating and managing our workforce and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted for example the covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand for our products due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines shelter in place or “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity and resources too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment resulting in excess fixed costs 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits with the consolidation of customers within the industry the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers the economic political and business conditions occurring nationally globally or in any of our key sales regions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result changing economic political or business conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

• a decline in demand for our products or services 

• an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers’ inability to pay us 

• an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory 

• valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 

• restructuring charges 

• asset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

• a decline in the value of our investments 

• exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition 

• a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor and 

• challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply 

fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues operating results and earnings where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in rd and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments cash flows collections and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us compliance with specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and limitations on our ability to share technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products or existing products have reliability quality design or safety problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace for more than 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver could be approaching its technological limit leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development in addition the emergence of “big data” and new tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence that capitalize on the availability of large data sets is leading semiconductor manufacturers and equipment manufacturers to pursue new products and approaches that exploit those tools to advance technology development in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies to invest in or acquire such business or technologies and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us we may find that acquisitions are not available to us for regulatory or other reasons and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions pursuing development through collaboration andor joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management including those related to aligning business objectives sharing confidential information intellectual property and data sharing value with third parties and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with nextgeneration devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers reevaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors’ products andor gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data 

similarly our customers may partner with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select our equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 14 

equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry as well as the emergence and strengthening of new regional competitors we may face increasing competitive pressures other companies continue to develop systems andor acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers’ needs to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd technological changes and developing technologies have required and are expected to continue to require new and costly investments certain of our competitors including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products andor product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours in addition we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match in many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

business and operational risks 

the covid19 outbreak has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

the covid19 outbreak and efforts by national state and local governments worldwide to control its spread have resulted in widespread measures aimed at containing the disease such as quarantines travel bans shutdowns and shelter in place or “stay at home” orders which collectively have significantly restricted the movement of people and goods and the ability of businesses to operate these restrictions and measures incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees customers and suppliers have affected and are affecting our business and operations by among other things causing facility closures production delays and capacity limitations disrupting production by our supply chain disrupting the transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers requiring modifications to our business processes requiring the implementation of business continuity plans requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes disrupting business travel disrupting our ability to staff our onsite manufacturing and research and development facilities delaying capital expansion projects and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce these impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause delays in product shipments and product development increases in costs and decreases in revenue profitability and cash from operations which have caused and are expected to cause an adverse effect on our results of operations that may be material the potential duration and impact of the outbreak on the global economy and on our business are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty but the outbreak has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets increases in levels of unemployment and economic 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 15 

uncertainty which has adversely impacted our business and may continue to do so and may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending demand for our products the ability of our customers to pay our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers and our access to external sources of financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures 

our revenues and operating results are variable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter or year factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

  

• economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry 

• the size and timing of orders from customers 

• changes in our deferred revenue balance including as a result of factors such as volume purchase agreements multiyear service contracts back orders and down payments toward purchases 

• consolidation of the customer base which may result in the investment decisions of one customer or market having a significant effect on demand for our products or services 

• procurement shortages 

• the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations 

• manufacturing difficulties 

• customer cancellations or delays in shipments installations customer payments andor customer acceptances 

• the extent that customers continue to purchase and use our products and services in their business 

• our customers’ reuse of existing and installed products to the extent that such reuse decreases their need to purchase new products or services 

• changes in average selling prices customer mix and product mix 

• our ability to develop introduce and market new enhanced and competitive products in a timely manner 

• our competitors’ introduction of new products 

• legal or technical challenges to our products and technologies 

• transportation communication demand information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as strikes acts of god wars terrorist activities widespread outbreak of illness natural or manmade disasters or climate change 

• legal tax accounting or regulatory changes including but not limited to changes in importexport regulations and tariffs or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements 

• changes in our estimated effective tax rate and 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

for example the covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand for our products due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines shelter in place or stay at home orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak 

certain critical information systems that we rely on for the operation of our business and products that we sell are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include but are not limited to telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors contractors customers and cloud providers in addition we make use of softwareasaservice saas products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers or thirdparty networks and servers all of which rely on networks email andor the internet for their function all of these information systems are subject to disruption breach or failure from various sources including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time those sources may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors phishing schemes and other thirdparty attacks and degradation or loss of service or access to data due to viruses malware denial of service attacks destructive or inadequate code power failures or physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines or networking equipment 

we have experienced cybersecurity and other threats and incidents in the past although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect we may incur material losses related to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents in the future if we were subject to a cybersecurity and other incident it could have a material adverse effect on our business such adverse effects might include 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 16 

• loss of or inability to access eg through ransomware confidential andor sensitive information stored on these critical information systems or transmitted to or from those systems 

• the disruption of the proper function of our products services andor operations 

• the failure of our or our customers’ manufacturing processes 

• errors in the output of our work or our customers’ work 

• the loss or public exposure of the personal information of our employees customers or other parties 

• the public release of customer orders financial and business plans and operational results 

• exposure to claims from third parties who are adversely impacted by such incidents 

• misappropriation or theft of our or a customer’s supplier’s or other partys assets or resources including technology data intellectual property or other sensitive information and costs associated therewith 

• reputational damage 

• diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering or 

• our failure to meet or violation of regulatory or other legal obligations such as the timely publication or filing of financial statements tax information and other required communications 

while we have implemented iso 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software intrusion prevention systems identity and access control and emergency recovery processes and we carefully select our thirdparty providers of information systems to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on and to our technology data intellectual property and other sensitive information those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents it has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen in addition there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks threats and incidents in a timely manner or at all or to respond expediently appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products our products are priced up to approximately 15 million per system as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

• a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products 

• a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products 

• export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets 

• an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate 

• increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines 

• increased pressure from regional competitors 

• technological changes that we are unable to address with our products or 

• a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 

in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products andor product capabilities including new products that take advantage of “big data” or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect 

outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development manufacturing operations field installation and support and many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 17 

single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships for example the covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations supply chain and customer support due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines stay at home orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak 

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities 

while we maintain business continuity plans our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or manmade disasters widespread outbreaks of illness terrorist activities political or governmental unrest or instability disruptions of our information technology resources utility interruptions the effects of climate change or other events beyond our control such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results for example the covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations supply chain and customer support due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales as reflected in part ii item 7 results of operation of this 2021 form 10k accounted for approximately 94 92 and 92 of total revenue in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

• domestic and international trade regulations policies practices relations disputes and issues 

• domestic and international tariffs export controls and other barriers 

• developing customers andor suppliers who may have limited access to capital resources 

• global or national economic and political conditions 

• changes in currency controls 

• differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions 

• our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems spare parts and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers 

• changes in and compliance with us and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations including us and international trade restrictions and sanctions antibribery anticorruption antiboycott environmental tax and labor laws 

• fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 

• the need for technical support resources in different locations and 

• our ability to secure and retain qualified people and effectively manage people in all necessary 

locations for the successful operation of our business 

for example the covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations supply chain and customer support due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines stay at home orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak 

there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china japan korea taiwan and the united states that political diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes impacts andor disruptions in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry this would adversely affect our business with china japan korea andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region or global economy a significant trade dispute impact andor disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

tariffs export controls additional taxes trade barriers sanctions or the termination or modification of trade agreements trade zones and other duty mitigation initiatives may increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions certain of our international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us or foreign governments and our inability to obtain such licenses or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues as is discussed below under the heading “our sales to customers in china a region of growing significance to us could be materially and adversely affected by export license requirements and other regulatory changes or other governmental actions in the course of the trade relationship between the us and china” the us government has recently expanded export license requirements that impact trade with china in addition the us government is in the process of assessing which “emerging and foundational” technologies may be subject to new or additional export controls under the 2018 export control reform act and it is possible that such controls if and when imposed could adversely impact our ability to sell our products outside the us furthermore there are risks that foreign governments may among other things insist on the use of local suppliers compel 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 18 

companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights andor local manufacturing utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues and provide special incentives to governmentbacked local customers to buy from local competitors even if their products are inferior to ours all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins 

we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro korean won malaysian ringgit and indian rupee currently we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro korean won malaysian ringgit and indian rupee in addition we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily thirdparty accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in these currencies 

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes can usually only be made with onshore cash balances since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills experiences and competencies this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions as well as increasing geographic expansion and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs global economic or political and industry conditions our organizational structure global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees the availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights trade secrets and other forms of protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques confidential andor as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the us or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees additionally intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the united states or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages moreover because we selectively file for patent protection in different jurisdictions we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability enhance our technological capabilities or accomplish other strategic objectives as a result we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 19 

of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies for regulatory or other reasons we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses products or technologies resulting in significant financial costs reduced or lost opportunities and diversion of management’s attention managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock 

legal regulatory and tax risks 

our sales to customers in china a region of growing significance to us could be materially and adversely affected by export license requirements and other regulatory changes or other governmental actions in the course of the trade relationship between the us and china 

china represents a large and fastdeveloping market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to our business revenue in china which includes global customers and domestic chinese customers with manufacturing facilities in china represented approximately 35 31 and 22 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the us and china have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the two countries recently these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the us government which have limited the market for our products adversely impacted our revenues and increased our exposure to foreign competition and could potentially do so to an even greater extent in the future for example over the course of calendar year 2020 the us department of commerce enacted a new rule that expanded export license requirements for us companies to sell certain items to companies and other endusers in china that are designated as military endusers or have operations that could support military end uses added additional chinese companies to its restricted entity list including semiconductor manufacturing international corporation or smic and related entities and expanded an existing rule referred to as the foreign direct product rule in a manner that could cause foreignmade wafers chipsets and certain related items produced with many of our products to be subject to us licensing requirements if huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” or its affiliates are parties to a transaction involving the items these rules have required and may require us to apply for and obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products to specified customers in china such as smic where those products would not otherwise require an export license to china and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all in addition our customers including but not limited to chinese customers may require us export licenses for the use of our products in order to manufacture products including semiconductor wafers and integrated circuits for those of their customers ie huawei and its affiliates that are subject to the expanded foreign direct product rule which may adversely impact the demand for our products the us department of commerce could in the future add additional chinese companies to its restricted entity list or take other actions that could expand licensing requirements or otherwise impact the market for our products and our revenue the implementation interpretation and impact on our business of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by the us government is uncertain and evolving and these rules other regulatory actions or changes and other actions taken by the governments of either the us or china or both that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income transaction and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities the amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 

recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting project have the potential to lead to changes in the tax laws in numerous countries in addition president joseph biden has made several corporate income tax proposals including a significant increase to the us corporate income tax rate and changes in the taxation of nonus income if enacted such changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 20 

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate 2 disagreements or disputes related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to export controls financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials antiboycott compliance conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation immigration or travel regulations antitrust regulations and laws or regulations relating to carbon emissions as well as other laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns among others each of these laws rules and regulations imposes costs on our business including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance and may present risks to our business including potential fines restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we do not fully comply 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in reduced operating income and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition andor results of operations could be adversely affected 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to undertake remediation activities suspend production andor cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations acquire significant additional equipment incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations or take other actions any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement misappropriation unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other thirdparty claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

our bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive judicial forum for certain legal actions between the company and its stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims 

our bylaws provide that unless we consent otherwise the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for lawsuits asserting certain stockholder claims including claims asserted derivatively for our benefit such as claims against directors and officers for breach of a fiduciary duty claims arising under any provision of the general corporation law of delaware or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine this is a general summary of the bylaw provision you should refer to the language of the bylaws for details while the forum provision does not generally apply to direct claims arising under the securities exchange act of 1934 or the securities act of 1933 derivative lawsuits that assert legal claims arising under these statutes could fall within the provision as recent court decisions have held 

as a delaware corporation delaware law controls issues of our internal affairs including duties that our directors officers employees and others owe to the company and its stockholders we believe that our exclusive forum provision benefits us and our stockholders by permitting relatively prompt resolution of lawsuits concerning our internal affairs promoting consistent application of delaware law in these lawsuits and reducing the possibility of duplicative costly multijurisdictional litigation with the potential for 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 21 

inconsistent outcomes however the forum provision limits a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes may be more favorable than delaware and this could discourage the filing of such lawsuits 

financial accounting and capital markets risks 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions or may subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

• general market semiconductor or semiconductor equipment industry conditions 

• economic or political events trends and unexpected developments occurring nationally globally or in any of our key sales regions 

• variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition including our liquidity 

• variations in our revenues earnings or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry 

• announcements of restructurings reductions in force departure of key employees andor consolidations of operations 

• margin trading short sales hedging and derivative transactions involving our common stock 

• government regulations 

• developments in or claims relating to patent or other proprietary rights 

• technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors 

• commercial success or failure of our new and existing products or 

• disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers 

in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors these and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

we may incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our goodwill identified in business combinations for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed the fair value we review all other longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that these assets may not be recoverable the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets requires significant judgement negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business units could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets 

when evaluating goodwill if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then a quantitative impairment test is performed and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations 

when evaluating other longlived assets if we conclude that the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying value we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations 

our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

we have 50 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding additionally we have funding available to us under our 15 billion commercial paper program and our 15 billion revolving credit facility which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional 6000 million for a potential total commitment of 21 billion we may in the future decide to enter into additional debt arrangements 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 22 

in addition we have entered and in the future may enter into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments 

our indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

• risk associated with the alternative reference rate reform eg libor transition 

• risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations 

• a portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations working capital capital expenditures expansion acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes and 

• impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain and any of our other future similar agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

• incur additional debt assume obligations in connection with letters of credit or issue guarantees 

• create liens 

• enter into transactions with our affiliates 

• sell certain assets and 

• merge or consolidate with any person 

our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes the convertible notes or our other debt which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014 our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks changes in federal state and international tax laws or corporate laws contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements availability of onshore cash flow and changes to our business model our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

executive summary 

lam research corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry we have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement chemistry plasma and fluidics advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller faster and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products including mobile phones personal computers servers wearables automotive vehicles and data storage devices 

our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory foundry and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as nvm dram and logic devices we aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success our core technical competency is integrating hardware process materials software and process control enabling results on the wafer 

semiconductor manufacturing our customers’ business involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer this involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale along with meeting technical requirements wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be costeffective 

demand from the cloud  iot and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost  efficient semiconductors at the same time there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing such as the increasing importance of vertical 3d scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks 

we believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition  etch and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing we have a broad portfolio of products that provide complementary processing steps used throughout semiconductor manufacturing our customer support business group focuses attention on delivering solutions that meet our customers’ technical requirements and productivity needs during the equipment lifecycle several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us i our focus on research and development with several ongoing programs relating to sustaining engineering product and process development and concept and feasibility ii our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base iii our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners and iv our focus on delivering our multiproduct solutions with a goal to enhance the value of lam’s solutions to our customers 

throughout the 2021 fiscal year there was an increase in wafer fabrication equipment spending by semiconductor manufacturers driven by the robust secular demand for semiconductors in a number of markets including highperformance computing personal computers and 5g networks customer demand was strong and we continued to increase our production output levels as we operated under covid19related safety protocols while we have seen improvements in both our own operations and those of our 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 27 

suppliers we experienced higher costs of goods sold related to freight and logistics during the year risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic remain which may continue to negatively impact our revenue and gross margin over the longer term we believe that secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable growth for our products and services and that technology inflections in our industry including 3d device scaling multiple patterning process flow and advanced packaging chip integration will lead to an increase in the served addressable market for our products and services in the deposition etch and clean businesses 

the following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below 



fiscal year 2021 revenue increased 46 compared to fiscal year 2020 reflecting stronger customer demand for semiconductor equipment gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to customer and product mix partially offset by higher costs incurred in freight and logistics as well as startup expenses for our new malaysia manufacturing facility the increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was mainly driven by higher employeerelated costs as a result of increased headcount outsourcing services deferred compensation planrelated costs and supplies partially offset by lower travel expenses and miscellaneous costs 

fiscal year 2020 revenue increased 4 compared to fiscal year 2019 reflecting stronger customer demand for semiconductor equipment gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to customer and product mix as well as lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired through business combinations partially offset by lower factory and field utilization the increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was mainly driven by higher employeerelated costs as a result of increased headcount and outsourcing services partially offset by lower travel expense miscellaneous costs and restructuring charges 

our cash and cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 60 billion as of june 27 2021 compared to 70 billion as of june 28 2020 cash flow provided from operating activities was 36 billion for fiscal year 2021 compared to 21 billion for fiscal year 2020 cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2021 was primarily used for 27 billion in treasury stock purchases including net share settlement on employee stockbased compensation 862 million of principal payments on debt instruments 727 million in dividends paid to our stockholders and 349 million of capital expenditures these cash outflows were partially offset by 122 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equitybased compensation programs 

results of operations 

revenue 



revenue increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal years 2020 and 2019 primarily due to the increased investment by our customers in semiconductor capital equipment as well as higher revenue from our customer support business group for spares services upgrades and mature node equipment the overall asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity investments for semiconductor manufacturing continued to occur in this region 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 28 

the deferred revenue balance was 11 billion as of june 27 2021 compared to 537 million as of june 28 2020 driven by increases in volume purchases for our systems customer down payments for future tool deliveries and additional deferrals related to tools pending full delivery and future servicing of our existing installed base 

the following table presents our revenue disaggregated between system and customer supportrelated revenue 



please refer to note 4 reven ue of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2021 form 10k for additional information regarding the composition of the two categories into which revenue has been disaggregated 

the percentage of leading and nonleadingedge equipment and upgrade revenue to each of the markets we serve was as follows   



gross margin 



the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily related to customer and product mix partially offset by increased spending on freight and logistics due in significant part to covid19 disruptions startup expenses for our malaysia manufacturing facility and deferred compensation planrelated costs 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to customer and product mix as well as lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired through business combinations partially offset by lower factory and field utilization 

research and development 



we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge deposition etch clean and other semiconductor manufacturing processes the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was mainly driven by an increase of 137 million in employeerelated costs due in part to increased headcount 49 million in outside service costs 32 million in deferred compensation planrelated costs and 27 million in spending for supplies 

the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was mainly driven by an increase of 50 million in employeerelated costs due to increased headcount 19 million in outsourcing service costs and 10 million in spending for supplies partially offset by a decrease of 7 million in travel expense and 5 million in restructuring charges 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 29 

selling general and administrative 



the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a 97 million increase in employeerelated costs due in part to increased headcount 37 million in outside service costs and 21 million in deferred compensation planrelated costs partially offset by a 9 million decrease in travel and entertainment costs 

the decrease in sga expense during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a 17 million decrease in spending for customerrelated sales costs a 9 million decrease in spending for supplies a 9 million decrease in restructuring charges and a 6 million decrease in spending for travel and entertainment partially offset by an increase of 25 million in spending for rent repair and utilities 

other expense net 

other expense net consisted of the following 



interest income decreased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 as a result of lower yield interest income decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 as a result of lower yield offset by a higher cash balance 

interest expense increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily due to the fullyear impact of the issuance of the 20 billion senior notes in fiscal year 2020 interest expense increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due to the fullyear impact of the issuance of the 25 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2019 and the issuance of 20 billion senior notes in fiscal year 2020 

gains on deferred compensation plan related assets in the periods presented were driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds 

the gains in other net for the fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were primarily driven by private equity investments 

income tax expense 

our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows 



the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020 as outlined below 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 30 

the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020 as outlined below 

in november 2019 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit “ninth circuit” rejected the en banc appeal petitioned by altera corporation “altera” in july 2019 in that quarter we evaluated the impact of the decision and viewed the denial as an indication that altera’s position of excluding stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement was unlikely to be sustained upon further litigation as a result we reversed 75 million of net tax assets associated with stockbased compensation benefits related to previous years in the condensed consolidated financial statements in the three months ended december 29 2019 and we no longer reflected a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to excluding stockbased compensation from our intercompany costsharing arrangement in february 2020 altera petitioned the supreme court of the united states scotus to hear their case in june 2020 the scotus denied the petition 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states international pretax income is taxable in the united states at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate please refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2021 form 10k 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets were 736 million and 575 million at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of 152 million and 196 million and a valuation allowance of 277 million and 245 million at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively the change in gross deferred tax assets gross deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2021 and 2020 is primarily due to increases in gross deferred tax assets for outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries allowances and reserves and tax credits and decreases in gross deferred tax liabilities for convertible debt 

as of our fiscal year ended june 27 2021 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in california the valuation allowances were 277 million and 245 million at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively 

we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our critical accounting estimates include 

• the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue 

• the valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin 

• the valuation of warranty reserves which impacts gross margin 

• the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes including the measurement of uncertain tax positions which impact our provision for income tax expenses and 

• the valuation and recoverability of longlived assets which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2021 form 10k for additional information regarding our accounting policies 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 31 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a fivestep process 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation as further described below 

identify the contract with a customer  we generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks payment histories andor other circumstances 

identify the performance obligations in the contract  performance obligations include sales of systems spare parts and services in addition our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract 

determine the transaction price  the transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time we generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year 

allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies 

recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation  revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time which is generally upon shipment or delivery revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less 

inventory valuation our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which the revision is made 

warranty we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 

longlived assets  we review goodwill at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment when reviewing goodwill for impairment we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in performing a qualitative assessment we consider business conditions and other factors including but not limited to i adverse industry or economic trends ii restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results iii sustained decline in share price and iv overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units if we conclude that it is more likely 

lam research corporation 2021 10k 32 

than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

if after completing the quantitative assessment the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value up to the amount of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit 

for other longlived assets we review them whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value if the sum is less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset’s carrying value the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value in addition for fully amortized intangible assets we derecognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 60 billion at the end of fiscal year 2021 compared to 70 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 this decrease was primarily due to common stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program dividends paid and principal payments on longterm debt partially offset by cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 36 billion during fiscal year 2021 consisted of in thousands 



significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following uses of cash increases in accounts receivable of 929 million inventories of 793 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of 59 million partially offset by the following sources of cash increases in deferred profit of 508 million accrued expenses and other liabilities of 409 million and accounts payable of 185 million 

cash flow from investing activities

lam research corporation 2021 10k 33 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2021 was 42 billion primarily consisting of 27 billion in common stock repurchases including net share settlement on employee stockbased compensation  862 million of principal payments on debt instruments and 727 million of dividends paid partially offset by 122 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stockbased compensation plans 

liquidity 

given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook combined with our current levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of june 27 2021 are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements capital expenditures capital redistributions and dividends through at least the next twelve months however uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry as well as disruptions in credit markets have in the past and could in the future impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however the ongoing covid19 pandemic has in the past caused disruption in the capital markets and were it to do the same in the future that could make any financing more challenging and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all

investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 27 2021 our mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as other expense net in our consolidated statement of operations all of our other investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

interest rate risk 

fixedincome securities 

our investments in various interestearning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixedincome investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target a capital preservationfocused investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and concentration risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixedincome securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps with a minimum interest rate of zero bps 

the hypothetical fair values as of june 27 2021were as follows 



we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

longterm debt 

as of june 27 2021 we had 50 billion in principal amount of fixedrate longterm debt outstanding with a fair value of 56 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature as applicable generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes

foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollar transactions or cash flows 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily cash thirdparty accounts receivable accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated nonus dollar transactions or cash flows we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months the option contracts include collars an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and notional amounts but with different strike prices these foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain nonusdollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily cash thirdparty accounts receivable accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 27 2021 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent

none  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with rule 13a15 of the exchange act in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 27 2021 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of june 27 2021 at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

in response to the covid19 pandemic a significant number of our employees are working remotely the design of our business processes and internal controls enabled remote execution through secure remote access to data while certain of our business processes required slight modification as a result of the need for remote work those changes did not result in the need for significant adjustments to our internal control structure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework used by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 27 2021 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm audited the financial statements included in this 2021 form 10k and has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part ii item 8 of this 2021 form 10k 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting

lam research corporation 2020 10k 9 

semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for ics and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements and forecasts in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months in order for spares and services to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and 2 delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not to exceed 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes as of june 28 2020  and june 30 2019  our backlog was 29 billion and 16 billion  respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations mainly consist of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers the assembly and testing of our products is conducted predominately in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and costeffective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 17 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments reported as a component of purchase obligations 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violations fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities

employees 

as of august 13 2020  we had approximately 11300 regular employees globally although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information as noted previously we outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing field service production warehousing and logistics functions to provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and costeffective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources targeted to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity defect control customer support and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements and similar factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of competition from thirdparty spare parts providers 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitor in the dielectric and metals deposition market is applied materials inc for ald and pecvd we also compete against asm international and wonik ips in the etch market our primary competitors are applied materials inc hitachi ltd and tokyo electron ltd and our primary competitors in the wet clean market are screen holding co ltd semes co ltd and tokyo electron ltd 

we face competition from a number of established and emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics and to provide more comprehensive offerings of products if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected strategic investments to encourage local semiconductor manufacturing and supply chain in china could increase competition from domestic equipment manufacturers in china there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and periods of rapid growth or decline we therefore face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand the industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities 

during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures for training assimilating and managing our workforce and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted for example the recent covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand for our products due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines shelter in place or “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment resulting in excess fixed costs 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits with the consolidation of customers within the industry the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers the economic political and business conditions occurring nationally globally or in any of our key sales regions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result changing economic political or business conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to

 fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues operating results and earnings where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in rd and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

our revenues and operating results are variable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter or year factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

  

 for example the recent covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand for our products due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines shelter in place or “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions or may subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors these and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

certain critical information systems that we rely on for the operation of our business and products that we sell are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include but are not limited to telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors contractors customers and cloud providers in addition we make use of softwareasaservice saas products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers or thirdparty networks and servers all of which rely on networks email andor the internet for their function all of these information systems are subject to disruption breach or failure from various sources including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time those sources may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors phishing schemes and other thirdparty attacks and degradation or loss of service or access to data due to viruses malware denial of service attacks destructive or inadequate code power failures or physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines or networking equipment 

we have experienced cybersecurity and other threats and incidents in the past although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect we may incur material losses related to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents in the future if we were subject to a cybersecurity and other incident it could have a material adverse effect on our business such adverse effects might include

 while we have implemented iso 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software intrusion prevention systems identity and access control and emergency recovery processes and we carefully select our thirdparty providers of information systems to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on and to our technology data intellectual property and other sensitive information those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents it has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen in addition our policies and procedures may not be effective in enabling us to identify risks threats and incidents in a timely manner or at all or to respond expediently appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments cash flows collections and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us compliance with specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and limitations on our ability to share technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products or existing products have reliability quality design or safety problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace for more than 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver could be approaching its technological limit leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development in addition the emergence of “big data” and new tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence that capitalize on the availability of large data sets is leading semiconductor manufacturers and equipment manufacturers to pursue new products and approaches that exploit those tools to advance technology development in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results

lam research corporation 2020 10k 18 

in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies to invest in or acquire such business or technologies and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us we may find that acquisitions are not available to us for regulatory or other reasons and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions pursuing development through collaboration andor joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management including those related to aligning business objectives sharing confidential information intellectual property and data sharing value with third parties and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with nextgeneration devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products our products are priced up to approximately 15 million per system as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products andor product capabilities including new products that take advantage of “big data” or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing 

continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2020 10k 19 

power based on their higher volumes in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers reevaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors’ products andor gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data 

similarly our customers may partner with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select our equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect 

outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development manufacturing operations field installation and support and many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships for example the recent covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations supply chain and customer support due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak 

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities 

while we maintain business continuity plans our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or manmade disasters widespread outbreaks of illness terrorist activities political or governmental unrest or instability disruptions of our information technology resources utility interruptions or other events beyond our control such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results for example the recent covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations supply chain and customer support due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales as reflected in part ii item 7 results of operation of this 2020 form 10k accounted for approximately 92  92  and 93 of total revenue in fiscal years 2020  2019  and 2018  respectively we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years

lam research corporation 2020 10k 20 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

 locations for the successful operation of our business 

for example the recent covid19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations supply chain and customer support due to production sourcing logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines “stay at home” orders facility closures workforce challenges and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak 

there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china japan korea taiwan and the united states that political diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes impacts andor disruptions in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry this would adversely affect our business with china japan korea andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region or global economy a significant trade dispute impact andor disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

tariffs export controls additional taxes trade barriers sanctions or the termination or modification of trade agreements trade zones and other duty mitigation initiatives may increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions in addition there are risks that foreign governments may among other things insist on the use of local suppliers compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights andor local manufacturing utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues and provide special incentives to governmentbacked local customers to buy from local competitors even if their products are inferior to ours all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins 

certain of our international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us or foreign governments our inability to obtain such licenses or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues 

we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won currently we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro and korean won in addition we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily thirdparty accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these

lam research corporation 2020 10k 21 

foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in these currencies 

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes can usually only be made with onshore cash balances since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes 

our sales to customers in china a region of growing significance to us could be materially and adversely affected by export license requirements and other regulatory changes or other governmental actions in the course of the trade relationship between the us and china 

china represents a large and fastdeveloping market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to our business revenue in china represented approximately 31 22 and 16 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the us and china have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the two countries in recent months these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the us government which could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues specifically on june 29 2020 a new rule enacted by the us department of commerce took effect that expands export license requirements for us companies to sell certain items to companies in china that are designated as military endusers or have operations that could support military end uses this rule may require us to apply for additional export licenses for our products to be sold to certain customers in china and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we may apply for on a timely basis or at all although we do not currently anticipate a material adverse impact from this rule on our revenues in china the impact of this rule is uncertain and could change in addition our international sales may also be impacted by export licensing requirements applicable to our customers and their products on august 17 2020 the us department of commerce expanded a rule originally published on may 19 2020 in a manner that could cause foreignmade wafers chipsets and certain related items produced with many of our products to be subject to us licensing requirements if huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” or its affiliates are parties to a transaction involving the items this new rule does not impose additional export license requirements on our products but it has the potential to adversely impact the demand for wafer fabrication equipment with usorigin technology potentially including many of our products by customers that may intend to use such equipment to produce wafers chipsets or certain related items when huawei or its affiliates are expected to be parties to a transaction involving the items the implementation interpretation and impact on our business of these rules is uncertain and evolving and these rules other regulatory changes and other actions taken by the governments of either the us or china or both that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry as well as the emergence and strengthening of new regional competitors we may face increasing competitive pressures other companies continue to develop systems andor acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers’ needs to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd technological changes and developing technologies have required and are expected to continue to require new and costly investments certain of our competitors including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products andor product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours in addition we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match in many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills experiences and competencies this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions as well as increasing geographic expansion and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs global economic or political and industry conditions our organizational structure global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees the availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income transaction and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities the amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation allowance 

continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2020 10k 23 

of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate 2 disagreements or disputes related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to export controls financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation immigration or travel regulations and antitrust regulations among others each of these laws rules and regulations imposes costs on our business including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance and may present risks to our business including potential fines restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased selling general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition andor results of operations could be adversely affected 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to undertake remediation activities suspend production andor cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations acquire significant additional equipment incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations or take other actions any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights trade secrets and other forms of protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques confidential andor as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the us or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees additionally intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the united states or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages moreover because we selectively file for patent 

continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2020 10k 24 

protection in different jurisdictions we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement misappropriation unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other thirdparty claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability enhance our technological capabilities or accomplish other strategic objectives as a result we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies for regulatory or other reasons we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses products or technologies resulting in significant financial costs reduced or lost opportunities and diversion of management’s attention managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock

we may incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets identified in business combinations and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business units could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets if in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value as determined by our market capitalization is less than the book value of our assets this could also indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations 

our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

we have 58 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and convertible notes outstanding additionally we have funding available to us under our 125 billion commercial paper program and our 125 billion revolving credit facility which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional 6000 million for a potential total commitment of 185 billion we may in the future decide to enter into additional debt arrangements 

in addition we have entered and in the future may enter into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments 

our indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain and any of our other future similar agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things

 our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes the convertible notes or our other debt which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014 our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks changes in federal state and international tax laws or corporate laws contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements availability of onshore cash flow and changes to our business model our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

lam research corporation 2020 10k 33 

individual steps fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale along with meeting technical requirements wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be costeffective 

demand from the cloud  iot and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost  efficient semiconductors at the same time there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing such as the increasing importance of vertical 3d scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks 

we believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition  etch and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing we have a broad portfolio of products that provide complementary processing steps used throughout semiconductor manufacturing our customer support business group focuses attention on delivery solutions that meet our customers’ technical requirements as well as productivity needs during the equipment lifecycle several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us i our focus on research and development with several ongoing programs relating to sustaining engineering product and process development and concept and feasibility ii our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base iii our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners and iv our focus on delivering our multiproduct solutions with a goal to enhance the value of lam’s solutions to our customers 

during fiscal year 2020 customer demand remained relatively strong however we experienced covid19related production and supply chain disruptions which impacted the timing of revenue recognition and negatively impacted our gross margin while we are currently seeing improvements in both our own operations and those of our suppliers risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic remain which may negatively impact our revenue and gross margin over the longer term while there are risks that the impact of covid19 to the broader macroeconomic environment may negatively impact our customer demand we believe that secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable growth for our products and services and that technology inflections in our industry including 3d device scaling multiple patterning process flow and advanced packaging chip integration will lead to an increase in our served addressable market for our products and services in deposition etch and clean 

the following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below 



fiscal year 2020 revenue increased 4 compared to fiscal year 2019  reflecting stronger customer demand for semiconductor equipment gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to customer and product mix as well as lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired through business combinations partially offset by lower factory and field utilization the increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was mainly driven by higher employeerelated costs as a result of increased headcount and outsourcing services partially offset by lower travel expense miscellaneous costs and restructuring charges

fiscal year 2019 revenue decreased 13 compared to fiscal year 2018  reflecting lower customer demand for semiconductor equipment gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to lower factory utilization the decrease in operating expenses in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was mainly driven by lower employeerelated costs and amortization related to intangibles acquired through business combinations partially offset by restructuring charges 

our cash and cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 70 billion as of june 28 2020  compared to 57 billion as of june 30 2019  cash flow provided from operating activities was 21 billion for fiscal year 2020 compared to 32 billion for fiscal year 2019  cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2020 was primarily used for 14 billion in treasury stock purchases 657 million in dividends paid to our stockholders and 203 million of capital expenditures these cash outflows were partially offset by 13 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt and 94 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equitybased compensation programs 

results of operations 

revenue 



revenue increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 but decreased compared to fiscal year 2018 primarily as a result of the variability of semiconductor capital investments by our customers the overall asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity investments for semiconductor manufacturing continued to occur in this region 

the deferred revenue balance was 537 million as of june 28 2020 compared to 449 million as of june 30 2019  driven primarily by additional deferrals towards the future servicing of our existing installed base and covid19related production disruptions 

the percentage of leading and nonleadingedge equipment and upgrade revenue to each of the markets we serve was as follows

gross margin 



the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to customer and product mix as well as lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired through business combinations partially offset by lower factory and field utilization 

the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to lower factory utilization 

research and development 



we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge deposition etch clean and other semiconductor manufacturing processes the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was mainly driven by an increase of 50 million in employeerelated costs due to increased headcount 19 million in outsourcing service costs and 10 million in spending for supplies partially offset by a decrease of 7 million in travel expense and 5 million in restructuring charges 

rd expense during fiscal year 2019 increased slightly compared to fiscal year 2018 

selling general and administrative 



the decrease in sga expense during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a 17 million decrease in spending for customerrelated sales costs a 9 million decrease in spending for supplies a 9 million decrease in restructuring charges and a 6 million decrease in spending for travel and entertainment partially offset by an increase of 25 million in spending for rent repair and utilities 

the decrease in sga expense during fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a 65 million decrease in employee variable compensation and a 17 million decrease in amortization related to intangibles acquired through business combinations partially offset by an increase of 10 million in depreciation and 8 million in restructuring charges

other expense net 

other expense net consisted of the following 



interest income decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 as a result of lower yield offset by a higher cash balance interest income increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 as a result of higher yield offset by a lower cash balance 

interest expense increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due to the fullyear impact of the issuance of the 25 billion of senior notes that occurred in fiscal year 2019 and the issuance of 20 billion senior notes in fiscal year 2020 the increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was also primarily due to the issuance of the 25 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2019 

the gains on deferred compensation plan related assets in the periods presented were driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds 

the loss on impairment of investments during fiscal year 2018 is the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with our cash repatriation strategy following the december 2017 us tax reform 

income tax expense 

our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows 



the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020 as outlined below 

the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the impact of us tax reform and its mandated onetime transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018 

in november 2019 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit “ninth circuit” rejected the en banc appeal petitioned by altera corporation “altera” in july 2019 in that quarter we evaluated the impact of the decision 

continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2020 10k 37 

and viewed the denial as an indication that altera’s position of excluding stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement was unlikely to be sustained upon further litigation as a result we reversed 745 million of net tax assets associated with stockbased compensation benefits related to previous years in the condensed consolidated financial statements in the three months ended december 29 2019 and we no longer reflected a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to excluding stockbased compensation from our intercompany costsharing arrangement in february 2020 altera petitioned the supreme court of the united states scotus to hear their case in june 2020 the scotus denied the petition 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states international pretax income is taxable in the united states at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate please refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2020 form 10k 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets were 575 million and 471 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of 196 million and 160 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively and a valuation allowance of 245 million and 227 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively the change in the gross deferred tax assets gross deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2020 and 2019 is primarily due to increases in outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries tax credits and operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets and decreases in prepaid cost sharing 

as of our fiscal year ended june 28 2020  we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in california the valuation allowances were 245 million and 227 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our critical accounting estimates include

 we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2020 form 10k for additional information regarding our accounting policies 

revenue recognition on june 25 2018 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 “asc 606”  revenue from contracts with customers which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605 revenue recognition and most industry specific guidance 

we recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a fivestep process 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation as further described below 

identify the contract with a customer  we generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks payment histories andor other circumstances 

identify the performance obligations in the contract  performance obligations include sales of systems spare parts and services in addition our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract 

determine the transaction price  the transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time we generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year 

allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies 

recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation  revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time which is generally upon shipment or delivery revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less 

inventory valuation our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which 

continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2020 10k 39 

those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 

longlived assets we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we will perform an impairment test at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or our failure to reach internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value further the value assigned to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2020 10k 40 

for other longlived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value if the sum is less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value in addition for fully amortized intangible assets we derecognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 70 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 compared to 57 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019  this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and the issuance of 20 billion of senior notes partially offset by common stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program and dividends paid 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 21 billion during fiscal year 2020 consisted of in thousands 



significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following uses of cash increases in accounts receivable of 642 million  inventories of 412 million  and prepaid assets of 14 million  partially offset by sources of cash increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 211 million  accounts payable of 208 million  and deferred profit of 76 million  

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used by investing activities during fiscal year 2020 was 244 million  primarily consisting of capital expenditures of 203 million  

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2020 was 624 million  primarily consisting of 14 billion in common stock repurchases 657 million of dividends paid partially offset by 13 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt and 94 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stockbased compensation plans

liquidity 

given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook combined with our current levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of june 28 2020  are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements capital expenditures capital redistributions and dividends through at least the next twelve months however uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry as well as disruptions in credit markets have in the past and could in the future impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us

revolving credit arrangements 

on march 12 2014 the company established an unsecured credit agreement this agreement was amended on november 10 2015 the “amended and restated credit agreement” october 13 2017 the “2nd amendment” and february 25 2019 the “3rd amendment” under the amended and restated credit agreement as amended by the 2nd and 3rd amendment the company has a revolving credit facility of 125 billion with a syndicate of lenders with an expansion option that will allow the company subject to certain requirements to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional 600 million  for a potential total commitment of 185 billion  the facility matures on october 13 2022  

interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is at our option based on 1 a base rate defined as the greatest of a prime rate b federal funds rate plus 05  or c onemonth london interbank offered rate “libor” plus 10  plus a spread of 00 to 05  or 2 libor multiplied by the statutory reserve rate plus a spread of 09 to 15  in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our noncredit enhanced senior unsecured longterm debt principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity additionally we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our credit rating the amended credit agreement contains affirmative covenants negative covenants financial covenants and events of default as of june 28 2020  we had no borrowings outstanding under the amended credit agreement and were in compliance with all financial covenants 

libor is currently expected to be discontinued by the end of calendar year 2021 we expect to amend the amended and restated credit agreement prior to that occurrence to provide for an alternative reference interest

rate plus an appropriate spread that approximates the existing reference interest rate as calculated in accordance with libor despite the current expectations we cannot be sure when libor is discontinued that we will be able to reach an agreement with the administrative agent under the amended and restated credit agreement on an alternate reference interest rate plus an appropriate spread or that changes to the determination of interest under our agreements would approximate the current calculation in accordance with libor if we should fail to reach agreement with the administrative agent on an alternate reference interest rate prior to such time as libor is unavailable as a reference rate then the borrowings will bear interest at a base rate determined in accordance with the amended and restated credit agreement tied to either the prime rate or federal funds rate plus a spread 

commercial paper program 

on november 13 2017 we established a commercial paper program the “cp program” under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 125 billion  individual maturities may vary but cannot not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the net proceeds from the cp program will be used for general corporate purposes including repurchases of our common stock from time to time under our stock repurchase program if at any time funds are not available under favorable terms under the cp program we may utilize the amended credit agreement for funding amounts available under the cp program may be reborrowed the cp program is backstopped by our revolving credit arrangement as of june 28 2020  we had no outstanding borrowings under the cp program 

other guarantees 

we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications as of june 28 2020  we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees 

generally we indemnify under predetermined conditions and limitations our customers for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees 

we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business as of june 28 2020  the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was 59 million  we do not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors consistent with our bylaws and certificate of incorporation and under local law we may be required to provide indemnification to our employees for actions within the scope of their employment although we maintain insurance contracts that cover some of the potential liability associated with these indemnification agreements there is no guarantee that all such liabilities will be covered we do not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under such indemnification agreements or statutory obligations

foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily cash thirdparty accounts receivable accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily on revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won 

to protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months the option contracts include collars an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and japanese yen notional amounts but with different strike prices these foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain nonusdollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily cash thirdparty accounts receivable accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are

 item 9a controls and procedures 

design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with rule 13a15 of the exchange act in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 28 2020  we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of june 28 2020  at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

in response to the covid19 pandemic a significant number of our employees are working remotely the design of our business processes and internal controls enabled remote execution through secure remote access to data while certain of our business processes required slight modification as a result of the need for remote work those changes did not result in the need for significant adjustments to our internal control structure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal controls — integrated framework used by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 28 2020  at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm audited the financial statements included in this 2020 form 10k and has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part ii item 8 of this 2020 form 10k

deposition processes and product families 

deposition processes create layers of dielectric insulating and metal conducting materials used to build a semiconductor device depending on the type of material and structure being made different techniques are employed electrochemical deposition creates the copper wiring interconnect that links devices in an integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” plating of copper and other metals is also used for tsv and wlp applications tiny tungsten connectors and thin barriers are made with the precision of chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition which adds only a few layers of atoms at a time plasmaenhanced cvd highdensity plasma cvd and ald are used to form the critical insulating layers that isolate and protect all of these electrical structures lastly postdeposition treatments such as ultraviolet thermal processing are used to improve dielectric film properties 

altus ® product family 

tungsten deposition is used to form conductive features such as contacts vias and wordlines on a chip these features are small often narrow and use only a small amount of metal so minimizing resistance and achieving complete fill can be difficult at these nanoscale dimensions even slight imperfections can impact device

performance or cause a chip to fail our altus ® systems combine cvd and ald technologies to deposit the highly conformal films needed for advanced tungsten metallization applications the multistation sequential deposition architecture enables nucleation layer formation and bulk cvd fill to be performed in the same chamber “in situ” pnl ®  our ald technology is used in the deposition of tungsten nitride films to achieve high step coverage with reduced thickness relative to conventional barrier films 

sabre ® product family 

copper deposition lays down the electrical wiring for most semiconductor devices even the smallest defect  say a microscopic pinhole or dust particle  in these conductive structures can impact device performance from loss of speed to complete failure the sabre ® ecd product family which helped pioneer the copper interconnect transition offers the precision needed for copper damascene manufacturing in logic and memory system capabilities include cobalt deposition for logic applications and copper deposition directly on various liner materials which is important for nextgeneration metallization schemes for advanced wlp applications such as forming conductive bumps and redistribution layers and for filling tsvs the sabre ® 3d family combines lam’s sabre electrofill ® technology with additional innovation to deliver the highquality films needed at high productivity the modular architecture can be configured with multiple plating and preposttreatment cells providing flexibility to address a variety of packaging applications 

sola ® product family 

dielectric materials designed to meet the insulation requirements of logic chips often have attributes that make them unusually difficult to use these films are easily damaged and vulnerable to losing some of their insulating capability which can lead to poor device performance to enable these applications some films can be stabilized  and others enhanced to improve device performance  using specialized postdeposition film treatments available with lam’s sola ® uvtp product family sola ® products offer process flexibility through independent control of temperature wavelength and intensity at each station of the wafer path enabled by multistation sequential processing architecture

dielectric gapfill processes deposit critical insulation layers between conductive andor active areas by filling openings of various aspect ratios between conducting lines and between devices with advanced devices the structures being filled can be very tall and narrow as a result highquality dielectric films are especially important due to the everincreasing possibility of crosstalk and device failure our speed ® hdpcvd products provide a multiple dielectric film solution for highquality gapfill with industryleading throughput and reliability speed ® products have excellent particle performance and their design allows large batch sizes between cleans and faster cleans 

striker ® product family 

the latest memory logic and imaging devices require extremely thin highly conformal dielectric films for continued device performance improvement and scaling for example ald films are critical for spacerbased multiple patterning schemes where the spacers help define critical dimensions as well as for insulating liners and gapfill in high aspect ratio features which have little tolerance for voids and even the smallest defect the striker ® singlewafer ald products provide dielectric film solutions for these challenging requirements through applicationspecific material process and hardware options that deliver film technology and defect performance 

vector ® product family 

dielectric film deposition processes are used to form some of the most difficulttoproduce insulating layers in a semiconductor device including those used in the latest transistors and 3d structures in some applications these films require dielectric films to be exceptionally smooth and defect free since slight imperfections are multiplied greatly in subsequent layers our vector ® pecvd products are designed to provide the performance and flexibility needed to create these enabling structures within a wide range of challenging device applications as a result of its design vector ® produces superior thin film quality along with exceptional withinwafer and wafertowafer uniformity

etch processes and product families 

etch processes help create chip features by selectively removing both dielectric insulating and metal conducting materials that have been added during deposition these processes involve fabricating increasingly small complex and narrow features using many types of materials the primary technology reactive ion etch bombards the wafer surface with ions charged particles to remove material for the smallest features atomiclayer etching “ale” removes a few atomic layers of material at a time while conductor etch processes precisely shape critical electrical components like transistors dielectric etch forms the insulating structures that protect conducting parts etch processes also create the tall columnlike features used for example in tsvs that link chips together and in mems 

flex ® product family 

dielectric etch carves patterns in insulating materials to create barriers between the electrically conductive parts of a semiconductor device for advanced devices these structures can be extremely tall and thin and involve complex sensitive materials slight deviations from the target feature profile  even at the atomic level  can negatively affect electrical properties of the device to precisely create these challenging structures our flex ® product family offers differentiated technologies and applicationfocused capabilities for critical dielectric etch applications uniformity repeatability and tunability are enabled by a unique multifrequency smallvolume confined plasma design flex ® offers in situ multistep etch and continuous plasma capability that delivers high productivity with low defectivity 

kiyo ® product family 

conductor etch helps shape the electrically active materials used in the parts of a semiconductor device even a slight variation in these miniature structures can create an electrical defect that impacts device performance in fact these structures are so tiny that etch processes are pushing the boundaries of the basic laws of physics and chemistry our kiyo ® product family delivers the highperformance capabilities needed to precisely and consistently form these conductive features with high productivity proprietary hydra technology in kiyo ® products improves critical dimension “cd” uniformity by correcting for incoming pattern variability and atomicscale variability control with productionworthy throughput is achieved with plasmaenhanced ale capability 

syndion ® product family 

plasma etch processes used to remove silicon and other materials deep into the wafer are collectively referred to as deep silicon etch these may be deep trenches for cmos image sensor pixel isolation trenches for power and other devices tsvs and other high aspect ratio features these are created by etching through multiple materials sequentially where each new material involves a change in the etch process the syndion ® etch product family is optimized for deep silicon etch providing the fast process switching with depth and crosswafer uniformity control required to achieve precision etch results the systems support both conventional singlestep etch and rapidly alternating process which minimizes damage and delivers precise depth uniformity 

versys ® metal product family 

metal etch processes play a key role in connecting the individual components that form an ic such as forming wires and electrical connections these processes can also be used to drill through metal hardmasks that pattern features too small for conventional masks allowing continued shrinking of feature dimensions to enable these critical etch steps the versys ® metal product family provides highproductivity capability on a flexible platform superior cd and profile uniformity are enabled by a symmetrical chamber design with independent process tuning features 

clean processes and product families 

clean techniques are used between manufacturing steps to clear away particles contaminants residues and other unwanted material that could later lead to defects and to prepare the wafer surface for subsequent processing wet processing technologies can be used for wafer cleaning and etch applications plasma bevel cleaning is used to enhance die yield by removing unwanted materials from the wafer’s edge that could impact the device area

coronus ® product family 

bevel cleaning removes unwanted masks residues and films from the edge of a wafer between manufacturing steps if not cleaned these materials become defect sources for instance they can flake off and redeposit on the device area during subsequent processes even a single particle that lands on a critical part of a device can ruin the entire chip by inserting bevel clean processes at strategic points these potential defect sources can be eliminated and more functional chips produced by combining the precise control and flexibility of plasma with technology that protects the active die area the coronus ® bevel clean family cleans the wafer’s edge to enhance die yield the systems provide active die area protection by using plasma processing with proprietary confinement technology applications include postetch pre and postdeposition prelithography and metal film removal to prevent arcing during plasma etch or deposition steps 

dvprime ®  da vinci ®  eos ®  and sp series product families 

wafer cleaning is performed repeatedly during semiconductor device manufacturing and is a critical process that affects product yield and reliability unwanted microscopic materials  some no bigger than the tiny structures themselves  need to be cleaned effectively at the same time these processes must selectively remove residues that are chemically similar to the device films for advanced wlp the wet clean steps used between processes that form the package and external wiring have surprisingly complex requirements these processes are called on to completely remove specific materials and leave other fragile structures undisturbed in iot products that include power devices mems and image sensors there is a unique requirement for wafer backside wet etch to uniformly thin the silicon wafer while protecting the device side of the wafer 

based on our pioneering singlewafer spin technology the dvprime ® and da vinci ® products provide the process flexibility needed with high productivity to address a wide range of wafer cleaning steps throughout the manufacturing process flow as the latest of lam’s wet clean products eos ® delivers exceptionally low onwafer defectivity and high throughput to address progressively demanding wafer cleaning applications including emerging 3d structures with a broad range of process capability our sp series products deliver costefficient productionproven wet clean and silicon wet etch solutions for challenging wlp and iot applications 

mass metrology processes and product 

mass metrology measures the change in mass following deposition etch and clean processes to enable monitoring and control of these oftenrepeated core manufacturing steps for design components like thin film stacks high aspectratio structures and complex 3d architectures optical techniques are limited in their ability to measure accurately the thick deep or otherwise visually obscured features measuring the change in mass for these applications provides a straightforward highprecision solution for monitoring and control of the critical features in advanced device structures where there is often little tolerance for variation our line of highprecision mass metrology systems provides inline monitoring and control of deposition etch and clean steps in real time  recording minute changes in mass to enable advanced detection of potential process excursions 

metryx ® product family 

metryx ® mass metrology systems provide high precision inline mass measurement for semiconductor wafer manufacturing nearly all semiconductor processes eg deposition etch and clean either add or remove materials from the wafer measuring mass change of a wafer before and after a process therefore is a simple and direct means of monitoring and controlling the process it is widely used to identify production wafer trends and excursions as they occur allowing corrections to be implemented quickly to prevent further yield loss it is particularly useful for ultrathin ultrathick and opaque films and complex 3d geometries of newer chip designs where traditional metrology and inspection techniques are ineffective 

the metryx ® mass metrology systems are available as both platformintegrated modules and as standalone systems key applications include high aspect ratio etch dram cell 3d nand channel hole carbon mask open conformal and ald sidewall deposition horizontal processing recess etch fill film density monitoring and wafer cleaningpolymer removal

the current and anticipated market demand for ics and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements and forecasts in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months in order for spares and services to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and 2 delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not to exceed 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes as of june 30 2019  and june 24 2018  our backlog was 16 billion and 20 billion  respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations mainly consist of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers the assembly and testing of our products is conducted predominately in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and costeffective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 16 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments reported as a component of purchase obligations 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violations fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities

employees 

as of august 15 2019  we had approximately 10700 regular employees globally although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information as noted previously we outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing field service production warehousing and logistics functions to provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and costeffective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources targeted to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity defect control customer support and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements and similar factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of competition from thirdparty spare parts providers 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitor in the dielectric and metals deposition market is applied materials inc for ald and pecvd we also compete against asm international and wonik ips in the etch market our primary competitors are applied materials inc hitachi ltd and tokyo electron ltd and our primary competitors in the wet clean market are screen holding co ltd semes co ltd and tokyo electron ltd 

we face competition from a number of established and emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics and to provide more comprehensive offerings of products if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected strategic investments to encourage local semiconductor manufacturing and supply chain in china could increase competition from domestic equipment manufacturers in china there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k “ 2019 form 10k” the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended by nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and periods of rapid growth or decline we therefore face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand the industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities 

during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures for training assimilating and managing our workforce and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment resulting in excess fixed costs 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a

significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits with the consolidation of customers within the industry the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers the economic political and business conditions occurring nationally globally or in any of our key sales regions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result changing economic political or business conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues operating results and earnings where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in rd and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

our revenues and operating results are variable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter or year factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to

 we may incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets identified in business combinations and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business units could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets if in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value as determined by our market capitalization is less than the book value of our assets this could also indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations 

our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

we have 45 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes convertible notes and commercial paper instruments outstanding additionally we have funding available to us under our 125 billion commercial paper program and our 125 billion revolving credit facility which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional 600 million for a potential total commitment of 185 billion we may in the future decide to enter into additional debt arrangements 

in addition we have entered and in the future may enter into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments 

our indebtedness could have adverse consequences including

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

conversion of our convertible notes may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share the number of shares of our common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible may be adjusted from time to time including increases in such rates as a result of dividends that we pay to our stockholders upon conversion of any convertible notes we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the convertible notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our stockholders prior to the maturity of the convertible notes if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price us generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count which would result in lower reported earnings per share the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain and any of our other future similar agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes the convertible notes or our other debt which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments cash flows collections and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us compliance with specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and limitations on our ability to share technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results

we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products or existing products have reliability quality design or safety problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace for more than 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver could be approaching its technological limit leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies to invest in or acquire such business or technologies and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect particularly as we seek to invest or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us we may find that acquisitions are not available to us for regulatory or other reasons and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions pursuing development through collaboration andor joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management including those related to aligning business objectives sharing confidential information intellectual property and data sharing value with third parties and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with nextgeneration devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products our products are priced up to approximately 11 million per system as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products andor product capabilities this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers reevaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors’ products andor gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data 

similarly our customers may partner with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select our equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect 

outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development manufacturing operations field installation and support and many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities 

while we maintain business continuity plans our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or manmade disasters terrorist activities disruptions of our information technology resources utility interruptions or other events beyond our control such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry as well as the emergence and strengthening of new regional competitors we may face increasing competitive pressures other companies continue to develop systems andor acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers’ needs to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products andor product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours in addition we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match in many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales as reflected in part ii item 7 results of operation of this 2019 form 10k accounted for approximately 92  93  and 92 of total revenue in fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

 locations for the successful operation of our business 

there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china japan korea taiwan and the united states that political diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes impacts andor disruptions in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry this would adversely affect our business with china japan korea andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region or global economy a significant trade dispute impact andor disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits tariffs export controls additional taxes trade barriers or sanctions may increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions in addition there are risks that foreign governments may among other things insist on the use of local suppliers compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights andor local manufacturing utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues and provide special incentives to governmentbacked local customers to buy from local competitors even if their products are inferior to ours all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us or foreign governments our failure or inability to obtain such licenses or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required could potentially limit our markets and impact our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fastdeveloping market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of anticipated growth for our business 

we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won currently we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro and korean won in addition we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily thirdparty accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in these currencies

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes can usually only be made with onshore cash balances since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills experiences and competencies this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions as well as increasing geographic expansion and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs global economic or political and industry conditions our organizational structure global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees the availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

certain critical information systems that we rely on for the operation of our business and products that we sell are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include but are not limited to telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors contractors customers and cloud providers in addition we make use of softwareasaservice saas products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers or thirdparty networks and servers all of which rely on networks email andor the internet for their function all of these information systems are subject to disruption breach or failure from various sources including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time those sources may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors phishing schemes and other thirdparty attacks and degradation or loss of service or access to data due to viruses malware denial of service attacks destructive or inadequate code power failures or physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines or networking equipment 

we have experienced cyber threats and incidents in the past although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect we may incur material losses related to cyber threats or incidents in the future if we were subject to a cyber incident it could have a material adverse effect on our business such adverse effects might include

while we have implemented iso 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software intrusion prevention systems identity and access control and emergency recovery processes and we carefully select our thirdparty providers of information systems to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on those mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and we may still suffer cyberrelated incidents 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income transaction and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities the amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to undertake remediation activities suspend production andor cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations acquire significant additional equipment incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations or take other actions any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability enhance our technological capabilities or accomplish other strategic objectives as a result we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies for regulatory or other reasons we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses products or technologies resulting in significant financial costs reduced or lost opportunities and diversion of management’s attention managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions or may subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors these and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement misappropriation unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other thirdparty claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights trade secrets and other forms of protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and

systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques confidential andor as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the us or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees additionally intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the united states or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages moreover because we selectively file for patent protection in different jurisdictions we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate 2 disagreements or disputes related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to export controls financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation immigration or travel regulations and antitrust regulations among others each of these laws rules and regulations imposes costs on our business including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance and may present risks to our business including potential fines restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased selling general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition andor results of operations could be adversely affected 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014 our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks changes in federal state and international tax laws or corporate laws contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements availability of onshore cash flow and changes to our business model our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

executive summary 

lam research corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry we have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement chemistry plasma and fluidics advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller faster and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products including mobile phones personal computers servers wearables automotive vehicles and data storage devices 

our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory foundry and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as nvm dram and logic devices we aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success our core technical competency is integrating hardware process materials software and process control enabling results on the wafer 

semiconductor manufacturing our customers’ business involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer this involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale along with meeting technical requirements wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be costeffective 

demand from the cloud  iot and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost  efficient semiconductors at the same time there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing such as the increasing importance of vertical 3d scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks 

we believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition  etch and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us i our focus on research and development with several ongoing programs relating to sustaining engineering product and process development and concept and feasibility ii our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base iii our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners and iv our focus on delivering our multiproduct solutions with a goal to enhance the value of lam’s solutions to our customers 

despite recent semiconductor capital investment volatility over the longer term we believe that technology inflections in our industry including 3d device scaling multiple patterning process flow and advanced packaging chip integration will lead to an increase in our served addressable market for our products and services in deposition etch and clean while there could be continued variability in the nearterm we believe that demand for our products and services will increase faster than overall spending on wafer fabrication equipment as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas and as we gain market share

the following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below 



fiscal year 2019 revenue decreased 13 compared to fiscal year 2018  reflecting lower customer demand for semiconductor equipment gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to lower factory utilization the decrease in operating expenses in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was mainly driven by lower employeerelated costs and amortization related to intangibles acquired through business combinations partially offset by restructuring charges 

fiscal year 2018 revenue increased 38 compared to fiscal year 2017  reflecting an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved primarily due to favorable margin mix and higher revenue operating expenses in fiscal year 2018 increased as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily as a result of higher employee headcount and increased investment in research and development 

our cash and cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 57 billion as of june 30 2019  compared to 52 billion as of june 24 2018  cash flow provided from operating activities was 32 billion for fiscal year 2019 compared to 27 billion for fiscal year 2018  cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2019 was primarily used for 38 billion in treasury stock purchases 678 million in dividends paid to our stockholders and 303 million of capital expenditures these cash outflows were partially offset by 20 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt and 85 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equitybased compensation programs

results of operations 

revenue 



revenue decreased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 but increased compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily as a result of the volatility of semiconductor capital investments by our customers the overall asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity investments for semiconductor manufacturing continued to occur in this region 

our deferred revenue balance was 449 million as of june 30 2019  compared to 994 million as of june 24 2018  the deferred revenue at the end of june 2019 is recognized under accounting standard codification “asc” 606 while the same values as of june 2018 are recognized under asc 605 which contributes to the change in value period over period our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to customers in japan was approximately 78 million as of june 30 2019  compared to 607 million as of june 24 2018  

the percentage of total lam semiconductor systems revenue to each of the markets we serve was as follows for fiscal year 2019    



gross margin 



the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to lower factory utilization 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to favorable margin mix and higher revenue

research and development 



we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge deposition etch clean and other semiconductor manufacturing processes rd expense during fiscal year 2019 increased slightly compared to fiscal year 2018  

the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to an 88 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount a 24 million increase in supplies and a 23 million increase in outside services and miscellaneous expenses 

selling general and administrative 



the decrease in sga expense during fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a 65 million decrease in employee variable compensation and a 17 million decrease in amortization related to intangibles acquired through business combinations partially offset by an increase of 10 million in depreciation and 8 million in restructuring charges 

the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a 44 million increase in employee compensation and benefits from increased headcount a 28 million increase in outside services and a 15 million increase in rent utilities and repairs

other expense net 

other expense net consisted of the following 



interest income increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 primarily as a result of higher yield interest expense in the year ended june 30 2019  increased compared to the year ended june 24 2018  primarily due to issuance of 25 billion of senior notes the decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the conversions of 2018 and 2041 convertible notes as well as the retirement of the 2018 convertible notes in may 2018 

the gain on deferred compensation plan related assets in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 was driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds 

the loss on impairment of investments during fiscal year 2018 is the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with our cash repatriation strategy following the december 2017 us tax reform 

loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2017 related to the special mandatory redemption of certain senior notes issued as well as the termination of the amended and restated term loan agreement following the termination of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with klatencor 

income tax expense 

as discussed in note 7 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2019 form 10k the “tax cuts  jobs act” hereafter referred to as “us tax reform” was signed into law on december 22 2017 and was effective starting in our quarter ended december 24 2017 us tax reform reduced the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 assessed a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the impact on income taxes due to a change in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of accounting standards codification “asc” 740 income taxes to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted in conjunction the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 which allowed for the recording of provisional amounts related to us tax reform and subsequent adjustments related to us tax reform during an up to oneyear measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations we recorded what we believed to be reasonable estimates during the sab 118 measurement period during the december 2018 quarter we finalized the accounting of the income tax effects of us tax reform although the sab 118 measurement period has ended there may be some aspects of us tax reform that remain subject to future regulations andor notices which may further clarify certain provisions of us

tax reform we may need to adjust our previously recorded amounts to reflect the recognition and measurement of our tax accounting positions in accordance with asc 740 such adjustments could be material 

the below discussion around the provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are significantly impacted by us tax reform 

our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows 



the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to 

the impact of us tax reform and its mandated onetime transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018 

the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the impact of us tax reform and its mandated onetime transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings 

in july 2015 the us tax court issued an opinion favorable to altera corporation “altera” with respect to altera’s litigation with the internal revenue service “irs” the litigation related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement with altera’s foreign subsidiary in its opinion the us tax court accepted altera’s position of excluding stockbased compensation from its intercompany costsharing arrangement in june 2019 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit “ninth circuit” through a threejudge panel reversed the 2015 decision of the us tax court altera has petitioned the ninth circuit for an en banc rehearing of a larger panel of eleven ninth circuit judges we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of this litigation on our fiscal year 2020 consolidated financial statements the estimated potential impact is in the range of 75 million which may result in a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states due to the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provision described in note 7  income taxes international pretax income is taxable in the united states at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate please refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2019 form 10k 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets were 471 million and 437 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of 160 million and 169 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively and a valuation allowance of 227 million and 200 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in the gross deferred tax assets and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2019 and 2018 is primarily due to increases in tax carryforwards 

as of our fiscal year ended june 30 2019  we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in california the valuation allowances were 227 million and 200 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our critical accounting estimates include 

 we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2019 form 10k for additional information regarding our accounting policies 

revenue recognition on june 25 2018 we adopted fasb asu no 201409 asc 606  revenue from contracts with customers which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605 revenue recognition and most industry specific guidance 

we recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a fivestep process 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price and 5 recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation as further described below 

identify the contract with a customer  we generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks payment histories andor other circumstances 

identify the performance obligations in the contract  performance obligations include sales of systems spare parts and services in addition our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract 

determine the transaction price  the transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time we generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance

lam research corporation 2019 10k 38 

our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year 

allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies 

recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation  revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time which is generally upon shipment or delivery revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less 

inventory valuation our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

longlived assets we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we will perform an impairment test at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2019 10k 39 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or our failure to reach internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value further the value assigned to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

for other longlived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value if the sum is less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 57 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019 compared to 52 billion at the end of fiscal year 2018  this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and the issuance of 25 billion of senior notes partially offset by common stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program and dividends paid

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 32 billion during fiscal year 2019 consisted of in millions 



significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following sources of cash decreases in accounts receivable of 732 million and inventories of 281 million  partially offset by uses of cash decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 195 million  deferred profit of 178 million  accounts payable of 131 million  and prepaid assets of 18 million  

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used by investing activities during fiscal year 2019 was 16 billion  primarily consisting of net purchases of availableforsale securities of 13 billion  along with capital expenditures of 303 million  

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2019 was 24 billion  primarily consisting of 38 billion in common stock repurchases 678 million of dividends paid 20 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt and 85 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stockbased compensation plans 

liquidity 

given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook combined with our current levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of june 30 2019  are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements capital expenditures capital redistributions and dividends through at least the next twelve months however uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry as well as disruptions in credit markets have in the past and could in the future impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us

 item 9a controls and procedures 

design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with rule 13a15 of the exchange act in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 30 2019  we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of june 30 2019  at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal controls — integrated framework used by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2019  at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm audited the financial statements included in this 2019 form 10k and has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part ii item 8 of this 2019 form 10k

deposition processes and product families 

deposition processes create layers of dielectric insulating and metal conducting materials used to build a semiconductor device depending on the type of material and structure being made different techniques are employed electrochemical deposition creates the copper wiring interconnect that links devices in an integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” plating of copper and other metals is also used for tsv and wlp applications small tungsten connectors and thin barriers are made with the precision of chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition which adds only a few layers of atoms at a time plasmaenhanced cvd highdensity plasma cvd and ald are used to form the critical insulating layers that isolate and protect all of these electrical structures lastly postdeposition treatments such as ultraviolet thermal processing are used to improve dielectric film properties 

altus ®  product family 

tungsten deposition is used to form conductive features such as contacts vias and plugs on a chip these features are small often narrow and use only a small amount of metal so minimizing resistance and achieving complete fill can be difficult at these nanoscale dimensions even slight imperfections can impact device performance or cause a chip to fail our altus ®  systems combine cvd and ald technologies to deposit the highly conformal films needed for advanced tungsten metallization applications the multistation sequential deposition architecture enables nucleation layer formation and bulk cvd fill to be performed in the same chamber “in situ” pnl ®  our ald technology is used in the deposition of tungsten nitride films to achieve high step coverage with reduced thickness relative to conventional barrier films

sabre ®  product family 

copper deposition lays down the electrical wiring for most semiconductor devices even the smallest defect  say a microscopic pinhole or dust particle  in these conductive structures can impact device performance from loss of speed to complete failure the sabre ®  ecd product family which helped pioneer the copper interconnect transition offers the precision needed for copper damascene manufacturing in logic and memory system capabilities include copper deposition directly on various liner materials which is important for nextgeneration metallization schemes for advanced wlp applications such as forming conductive bumps and redistribution layers and for filling tsvs the sabre ®  3d family combines lam’s sabre electrofill ®  technology with additional innovation to deliver the highquality films needed at high productivity the modular architecture can be configured with multiple plating and preposttreatment cells providing flexibility to address a variety of packaging applications 

sola ® product family 

dielectric materials designed to meet the insulation requirements of logic chips often have attributes that make them unusually difficult to use these films are easily damaged and vulnerable to losing some of their insulating capability which can lead to poor device performance to enable these applications some films can be stabilized  and others enhanced to improve device performance  using specialized postdeposition film treatments available with lam’s sola ®  uvtp product family sola ®  products offer process flexibility through independent control of temperature wavelength and intensity at each station of the wafer path enabled by multistation sequential processing architecture 

speed ®  product family 

dielectric gapfill processes deposit critical insulation layers between conductive andor active areas by filling openings of various aspect ratios between conducting lines and between devices with advanced devices the structures being filled can be very tall and narrow as a result highquality dielectric films are especially important due to the everincreasing possibility of crosstalk and device failure our speed ®  hdpcvd products provide a multiple dielectric film solution for highquality gapfill with industryleading throughput and reliability speed ®  products have excellent particle performance and their design allows large batch sizes between cleans and faster cleans 

striker ®  product family 

the latest memory logic and imaging devices require extremely thin highly conformal dielectric films for continued device performance improvement and scaling for example such films are critical for spacerbased multiple patterning schemes where the spacers help define critical dimensions as well as for insulating liners which have little tolerance for even the smallest defect the striker ®  singlewafer ald products provide solutions for these challenging requirements through applicationspecific process and hardware options that deliver film technology and defect performance reduced processing times with striker ®  products are enabled by rapid ald cycles and aldrated components software and controls 

vector ®  product family 

dielectric film deposition processes are used to form some of the most difficulttoproduce insulating layers in a semiconductor device including those used in the latest transistors and 3d structures in some applications these films need to conform tightly around intricate structures other applications require dielectric films to be exceptionally smooth and defect free since slight imperfections are multiplied greatly in subsequent layers our vector ®  pecvd products are designed to provide the performance and flexibility needed to create these enabling structures within a wide range of challenging device applications as a result of its design vector ®  produces superior thin film quality along with exceptional withinwafer and wafertowafer uniformity reduced processing time is enabled by proprietary wafer heatup independent of film deposition 

etch processes and product families 

etch processes help create chip features by selectively removing both dielectric insulating and metal conducting materials that have been added during deposition these processes involve fabricating increasingly small complex and narrow features using many types of materials the primary technology reactive ion etch bombards the wafer surface with ions charged particles to remove material for the smallest features atomic

layer etching “ale” removes a few atomic layers of material at a time while conductor etch processes precisely shape critical electrical components like transistors dielectric etch forms the insulating structures that protect conducting parts etch processes also create the tall columnlike features used for example in tsvs that link chips together and in mems 

flex ®  product family 

dielectric etch carves patterns in insulating materials to create barriers between the electrically conductive parts of a semiconductor device for advanced devices these structures can be extremely tall and thin and involve complex sensitive materials slight deviations from the target feature profile  even at the atomic level  can negatively affect electrical properties of the device to precisely create these challenging structures our flex ®  product family offers differentiated technologies and applicationfocused capabilities for critical dielectric etch applications uniformity repeatability and tunability are enabled by a unique multifrequency smallvolume confined plasma design flex offers in situ multistep etch and continuous plasma capability that delivers high productivity with low defectivity 

kiyo ®  product family 

conductor etch helps shape the electrically active materials used in the parts of a semiconductor device even a slight variation in these miniature structures can create an electrical defect that impacts device performance in fact these structures are so tiny that etch processes are pushing the boundaries of the basic laws of physics and chemistry our kiyo ®  product family delivers the highperformance capabilities needed to precisely and consistently form these conductive features with high productivity proprietary hydra technology in kiyo ®  products improves critical dimension “cd” uniformity by correcting for incoming pattern variability and atomicscale variability control with productionworthy throughput is achieved with plasmaenhanced ale capability 

syndion ®  product family 

plasma etch processes used to remove silicon and other materials deep into the wafer are collectively referred to as deep silicon etch these deep trenches tsvs and other high aspect ratio features are created by etching through multiple materials sequentially where each new material involves a change in the etch process as they are often electrically isolating or connecting structures even slight variation from target results can negatively impact device performance the syndion ®  etch product family is optimized for deep silicon etch providing the fast process switching with depth and crosswafer uniformity control required to achieve precision etch results the systems support both conventional singlestep etch and rapidly alternating process which minimizes damage and delivers precise depth uniformity 

versys ®  metal product family 

metal etch processes play a key role in connecting the individual components that form an ic such as forming wires and electrical connections these processes are also used to drill through the metal hardmasks that are used to pattern features too small for conventional masks thereby allowing continued shrinking of feature dimensions to enable performing these critical etch steps the versys ®  metal product family provides highproductivity capability on a flexible platform superior cd and profile uniformity are enabled by a symmetrical chamber design with independent process tuning features 

clean processes and products 

clean techniques are used between manufacturing steps to clear away particles contaminants residues and other unwanted material that could later lead to defects and to prepare the wafer surface for subsequent processing wet processing technologies can be used for wafer cleaning and etch applications plasma bevel cleaning is used to enhance die yield by removing unwanted materials from the wafer’s edge that could impact the device area 

coronus ®  product family 

bevel cleaning removes unwanted masks residues and films from the edge of a wafer between manufacturing steps if not cleaned these materials become defect sources for instance they can flake off and redeposit on the device area during subsequent processes even a single particle that lands on a critical part of a device can ruin the entire chip by inserting bevel clean processes at strategic points these potential defect sources can be

eliminated and more good chips produced by combining the precise control and flexibility of plasma with technology that protects the active die area the coronus ® bevel clean family cleans the wafer’s edge to enhance die yield   the systems provide active die area protection by using plasma processing with proprietary confinement technology applications include postetch pre and postdeposition prelithography and metal film removal to prevent arcing during plasma etch or deposition steps 

da vinci ®  dvprime ®  eos ®  sp series product families 

wafer cleaning is performed repeatedly during semiconductor device manufacturing and is a critical process that affects product yield and reliability unwanted microscopic materials  some no bigger than the tiny structures themselves  need to be cleaned effectively at the same time these processes must selectively remove residues that are chemically similar to the device films for advanced wlp the wet clean steps used between processes that form the package and external wiring have surprisingly complex requirements these processes are called on to completely remove specific materials and leave other fragile structures undisturbed 

based on our pioneering singlewafer spin technology the dvprime ®  and da vinci ®  products provide the process flexibility needed with high productivity to address a wide range of wafer cleaning steps throughout the manufacturing process flow as the latest of lam’s wet clean products eos ®  delivers exceptionally low onwafer defectivity and high throughput to address progressively demanding wafer cleaning applications including emerging 3d structures with a broad range of process capability our sp series products deliver costefficient productionproven wet cleanwet etch solutions for challenging wlp applications 

mass metrology processes and product 

mass metrology measures the change in mass following deposition etch and clean processes to enable monitoring and control of these oftenrepeated core manufacturing steps for design components like thin film stacks high aspectratio structures and complex 3d architectures optical techniques are limited in their ability to measure accurately the thick deep or otherwise visually obscured features measuring the change in mass for these applications provides a straightforward highprecision solution for monitoring and control of the critical features in advanced device structures where there is often little tolerance for variation our line of highprecision mass metrology systems provides inline monitoring and control of deposition etch and clean steps in real time  recording minute changes in mass to enable advanced detection of potential process excursions 

metryx ®  product families 

inline process monitoring is used to identify production wafer trends and excursions as they occur allowing corrections to be implemented quickly to prevent further yield loss for deposition etch and clean steps measurement of the mass change of a wafer before and after a process is a simple and direct means of monitoring and controlling process results particularly for ultrathin films ultrathick films and complex 3d geometries of newer chip designs where traditional optical metrology techniques are ineffective the metryx ®  mass metrology systems available as both platformintegrated modules and as standalone systems deliver submilligram mass measurement capability for advanced process monitoring and control of threedimensional device structures key applications include high aspect ratio etch dram cell 3d nand channel hole conformal and aldsidewall deposition horizontal processing recess etch fill film density monitoring carbon mask open and wafer cleaningpolymer removal 

legacy products 

for applications that do not require the most advanced wafer processing capability semiconductor manufacturers can benefit from the proven performance of previousgeneration products to increase their production capacity at a reduced economic investment purchasing through an original equipment manufacturer like us minimizes the risks of unexpected costs and unpredictable time to production that are typically associated with the legacy equipment market to meet semiconductor manufacturers’ needs for highperformance maximumpredictability and lowrisk equipment we provide new refurbished and legacy products to customers utilizing technology nodes at and above 28 nm these products benefit from many of the technical advances from our newest systems enabling extended lifetime and productivity our products also provide productionworthy costeffective solutions for mems power semiconductor radio frequency device and light emitting diode markets

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to achieve and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development “rd” programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  were 12 billion  10 billion  and  914 million  respectively the majority of rd spending over the past three years has been targeted at deposition etch clean and other semiconductor manufacturing products we believe current challenges for customers at various points in the semiconductor manufacturing process present opportunities for us 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs support our growth strategy and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service 

our marketing sales and service efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet their needs these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions for their wafer processing needs we maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of service engineers in place throughout the united states china europe japan korea southeast asia and taiwan we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace 

we provide standard warranties for our systems the warranty provides that systems will be free from defects in material and workmanship and will conform to agreedupon specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired

international sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls compliance with us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions and economic and political conditions any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows for geographical reporting revenue is attributed to the geographic location in which the customers’ facilities are located revenue by region was as follows 

longlived assets 

refer to note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for information concerning the geographic locations of longlived assets 

customers 

our customers include all of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities customers accounting for greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal year 2018  included intel corporation micron technology inc samsung electronics company ltd sk hynix inc and toshiba inc customers accounting for greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal year 2017  included micron technology inc samsung electronics company ltd sk hynix inc taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and toshiba inc customers accounting for greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal year 2016  included micron technology inc samsung electronics company ltd sk hynix inc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 

a material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for ics and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements and forecasts in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months in order for spares and services to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and 2 delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not to exceed 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes as of june 24 2018  and june 25 2017  our backlog was 20 billion  and 21 billion  respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations mainly consist of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers the assembly and testing of our products is conducted predominately in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and costeffective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments reported as a component of purchase obligations 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violations fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities

employees 

as of august 9 2018  we had approximately 10900 regular employees globally although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information as noted previously we outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing field service production warehousing and logistics functions to provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and costeffective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources targeted to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity defect control customer support and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements and similar factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of competition from thirdparty spare parts providers 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitor in the dielectric and metals deposition market is applied materials inc for ald and pecvd we also compete against asm international and wonik ips in the etch market our primary competitors are applied materials inc hitachi ltd and tokyo electron ltd and our primary competitors in the wet clean market are screen holding co ltd semes co ltd and tokyo electron ltd 

we face competition from a number of established and emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics and to provide more comprehensive offerings of products if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected strategic investments to encourage local semiconductor manufacturing and supply chain in china could increase competition from domestic equipment manufacturers in china there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k “ 2018  form 10k” the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and periods of rapid growth or decline we therefore face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand the industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities 

during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures for training assimilating and managing our workforce and in appropriately sizing our supply chain

infrastructure and facilities work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment resulting in excess fixed costs 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits with the consolidation of customers within the industry the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers the economic political and business conditions occurring nationally globally or in any of our key sales regions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result changing business or economic conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues operating results and earnings where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in rd and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results

our quarterly revenues and operating results are variable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

  

 we may incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets identified in business combinations and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business units could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets if in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value as determined by our market capitalization is less than the book value of our assets this could also indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations

our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

we have 25 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes convertible notes and commercial paper instruments outstanding additionally we have funding available to us under our 125 billion commercial paper program and our 125 billion revolving credit facility which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional 600 million for a potential total commitment of 185 billion we may in the future decide to enter into additional debt arrangements 

in addition we have entered and in the future may enter into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments 

our indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

conversion of our convertible notes and the exercise of the related warrants may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share the number of shares of our common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible and for which related warrants are exercisable for may be adjusted from time to time including increases in such rates as a result of dividends that we pay to our stockholders upon conversion of any convertible notes we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the convertible notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our stockholders this dilution may not be completely mitigated by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of certain convertible notes or through share repurchases prior to the maturity of the convertible notes if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price us generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count which would result in lower reported earnings per share the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain and any of our other future similar agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 



continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2018 10k   18 

  

our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes the convertible notes or our other debt which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments cash flows collections and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us compliance with specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products or existing products have reliability quality design or safety problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace for more than 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver could be approaching its technological limit leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies to invest in or acquire such business or technologies and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect particularly as we seek to invest or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us we may find that acquisitions are not available to us for regulatory or other reasons and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions pursuing development through collaboration andor joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management including those related to aligning business objectives sharing confidential information and intellectual property sharing value with third parties and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with nextgeneration devices this shift may result in a

reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products our products are priced up to approximately 11 million per system as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products andor product capabilities this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers reevaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors’ products andor gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property 

similarly our customers may partner with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select our equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect 

outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations field installation and support and many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become

subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure  events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships 

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities 

our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or manmade disasters terrorist activities disruptions of our information technology resources utility interruptions or other events beyond our control such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry we may face increasing competitive pressures other companies continue to develop systems andor acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers’ needs to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products andor product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours in addition we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match in many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales as reflected in part 1 item 1 business of this 2018 form 10k accounted for approximately 93  92  and 92  of total revenue in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

 locations for the successful operation of our business 

there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china japan korea taiwan and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions this would adversely affect our business with china japan korea andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits tariffs additional taxes or trade barriers may increase our manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions in addition there are risks that foreign governments may among other things insist on the use of local suppliers compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights andor local manufacturing and provide special incentives to governmentbacked local customers to buy from local competitors even if their products are inferior to ours all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses could potentially limit our markets and impact our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fastdeveloping market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of anticipated growth for our business 

we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won currently we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro and korean won in addition we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily thirdparty accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables we believe these are our 

continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2018 10k   22 

  

primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in these currencies 

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes can usually only be made with onshore cash balances since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills experiences and competencies this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions as well as increasing geographic expansion that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs global economic or political and industry conditions our organizational structure global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees the availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

certain critical information systems that we rely on for the operation of our business and products that we sell are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include but are not limited to telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors contractors and cloud providers in addition we make use of softwareasaservice saas products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers or third party networks and servers all of which rely on networks email andor the internet for their function all of these information systems are subject to disruption breach or failure from various sources including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time those sources may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors phishing schemes and other thirdparty attacks and degradation or loss of service or access to our data due to viruses malware denial of service attacks destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment 

we have experienced cyber threats and incidents in the past although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect we may incur material losses related to cyber threats or incidents in the future if we were subject to a cyber incident it could have a material adverse effect on our business such adverse effects might include

 while we have implemented iso 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software intrusion prevention systems identity and access control and emergency recovery processes and we carefully select our third party providers of information systems to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on those mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and we may still suffer cyberrelated incidents 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production andor cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations acquire significant additional equipment incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations or take other actions any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies for regulatory or other reasons we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses products or technologies resulting in significant financial costs reduced or lost opportunities and diversion of management’s attention managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage

lam research corporation 2018 10k   24 

  

successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions or may subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors these and other factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other thirdparty claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the us or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties of ours or even of our own employees additionally intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages moreover because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation immigration or travel regulations and antitrust regulations among others each of these laws rules and regulations imposes costs on our business including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance and may present risks to our business including potential fines restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws

regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased selling general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition andor results of operations could be adversely affected 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014 our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks changes in federal state and international income tax laws or corporate laws contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements availability of onshore cash flow and changes to our business model our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

executive summary 

lam research is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry we have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement chemistry plasma and fluidics advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller faster and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products including mobile phones personal computers servers wearables automotive devices storage devices and networking equipment our vision is to realize full value from natural technology extensions of our company 

our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory foundry and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as nvm dram memory and logic devices we aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success our core technical competency is integrating hardware process materials software and process control enabling results on the wafer 

semiconductor manufacturing our customers’ business involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer this involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale along with meeting technical requirements wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be costeffective 

demand from the cloud   iot and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost  efficient semiconductors at the same time there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing such as the increasing importance of vertical 3d scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks 

we believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition   etch and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us i our focus on research and development with several ongoing programs relating to sustaining engineering product and process development and concept and feasibility ii our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base iii our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners and iv focus on delivering our multiproduct solutions with a goal to enhance the value of lam’s solutions to our customers 

during the most recent fiscal year demand for our products improved as semiconductor device manufacturers made technology and capacity investments over the longer term we believe that our technology inflections in our industry including 3d device scaling multiple patterning process flow and advanced packagingchip integration will lead to an increase in our served addressable market for our products and services in deposition etch and clean while there could be variability in the nearterm we believe that demand for our products and services will increase faster than overall spending on wafer fabrication equipment as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas and we target to gain market share 

we acquired the outstanding shares of coventor inc “coventor” a privatelyheld company on august 28 2017 as further discussed in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this 2018 form 10k the results of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements

the following summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below 



revenues in fiscal year 2018  increased 38  compared to fiscal year 2017  and revenues in fiscal year 2017  increased 36  compared to fiscal year 2016  reflecting an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to favorable margin mix and higher revenue 

fiscal year 2017 gross margin as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal year 2016 improved primarily due to higher revenue and improved factory utilization resulting from higher production volume 

operating expenses in fiscal year 2018  increased as compared to fiscal years 2017  and 2016 primarily as a result of higher employee headcount and increased investment in research and development 

our cash and cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 52 billion  as of june 24 2018  compared to 63 billion  as of june 25 2017  cash flow provided from operating activities was 27 billion  for fiscal year 2018  compared to 20 billion  for fiscal year 2017  cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal 2018  was primarily used for 27 billion  in treasury stock purchases 396 million in net principal payments on debt 308 million  in dividends paid to our stockholders and 273 million  of capital expenditures and are partially offset by 85 million  of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equitybased compensation programs

the percentage of total lam semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the markets we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016    



our shipments to memory customers during the fiscal year 2018 increased primarily due to higher levels of investments from our dram and nand customers our shipments to foundry customers decreased during the fiscal year 2018 primarily due to decreased investments in leading and trailing edge technology applications from our foundry customers 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 24 2018  were approximately 20 billion  a slight decrease from approximately 21 billion  as of june 25 2017  our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this 2018  form 10k for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog 

revenue 



the revenue increases in fiscal year 2018  compared to the last two fiscal years and in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 reflect an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continued to occur in this region

our deferred revenue balance was 994 million  as of june 24 2018  compared to 966 million  as of june 25 2017  as noted in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2018  form 10k the adoption of accounting standard update 201409 is expected to result in a net decrease estimated between 100 million and 200 million to our total current liabilities balance affecting our deferred revenue deferred costs and resulting deferred profit recognition our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 607 million  as of june 24 2018  compared to 397 million  as of june 25 2017  

gross margin 



the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to favorable margin mix and higher revenue 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to higher revenue and improved factory utilization resulting from higher production volume 

research and development 



we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge deposition etch clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to an 88 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount a 24 million increase in supplies and a 23 million increase in outside services and miscellaneous expenses 

the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to an 80 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount a 20 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance a 9 million increase in outside services and a 7 million increase in supplies

selling general and administrative 



the increase in selling general and administrative “sga” expense during fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to a 44 million increase in employee compensation and benefits from increased headcount a 28 million increase in outside services and a 15 million increase in rent utilities and repairs 

the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to a 36 million increase in employee compensation and benefits from increased headcount a 15 million gain from sale of assets in fiscal year 2016 and a 14 million increase in outside services offset by a 41 million decrease in acquisitionrelated costs associated with the terminated agreement with klatencor 

other expense net 

other expense net consisted of the following 



interest income increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 primarily as a result of higher yield 

the decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the conversions of 2018 and 2041 convertible notes as well as the retirement of the 2018 convertible notes in may 2018 the decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the retirement of the 2016 convertible notes 

the gain on deferred compensation plan related assets in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 compared to a loss in fiscal year 2016 was driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds

the loss on impairment of investments during fiscal year 2018 is the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with our cash repatriation strategy following the december 2017 us tax reform 

loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2017 related to the special mandatory redemption of certain senior notes issued as well as the termination of the amended and restated term loan agreement following the termination of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with klatencor 

income tax expense 

as discussed in note 6 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2018 form 10k the “tax cuts  jobs act” hereafter referred to as “us tax reform” was signed into law on december 22 2017 and was effective starting in our quarter ended december 24 2017 us tax reform reduces the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 mandates payment of a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the impact on income taxes due to a change in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of accounting standards codification “asc” 740 income taxes to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted in conjunction the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 which allows for the recording of provisional amounts related to us tax reform and subsequent adjustments related to us tax reform during an up to oneyear measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations as such there is significant activity in the fiscal year ended june 24 2018  which reflects the change in legislation most of that activity has provisionally been recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the period ended june 24 2018 as we have not yet completed all of the accounting for the tax effects of enactment we recorded what we believe to be a reasonable estimate and the provisional activity is subject to further adjustments under sab 118 with the exception of revaluation of our deferred tax balances to reflect the new us federal statutory tax rate which is considered final and complete under sab 118 in addition for significant items for which we could not make a reasonable estimate no provisional activity was recorded we will continue to refine the provisional balances and adjustments may be made under sab 118 during the measurement period as a result of future changes in interpretation information available assumptions made by the company andor issuance of additional guidance these adjustments could be material 

the below discussion around the provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are significantly impacted by us tax reform 

our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows 



the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the impact of us tax reform and its mandated onetime transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings 

the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the change in the mix of income offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits 

in july 2015 the us tax court issued an opinion favorable to altera corporation “altera” with respect to altera’s litigation with the internal revenue service “irs” the litigation related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement with altera’s foreign subsidiary in its opinion the us tax court accepted altera’s position of excluding stockbased compensation from its intercompany costsharing arrangement in july 2018 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the 2015 decision of the us tax court in august 2018 the opinion made by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit was withdrawn to allow time for a reconstituted panel to confer on the appeal we are currently

evaluating the impact if any of these subsequent events on our fiscal year 2019 consolidated financial statements we are unable to estimate the impact at this time 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states additionally the impact of us tax reform is being evaluated for how it will affect future years’ tax expense due to tax reform provisions that we will be subject to beginning in fiscal year 2019 tax reform provisions being evaluated impacting future years include “global intangible lowtaxed income” “gilti” and other provisions please refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2018 form 10k 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets were 437 million and 546 million at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of 169 million and 585 million at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively and a valuation allowance of 200 million and 114 million at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively the change in the gross deferred tax assets gross deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2018 and 2017 is primarily due to deferred revaluation to reflect the new us statutory tax rate and decreases related to allowances and reserves prepaid cost sharing and unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 

as of our fiscal year ended june 24 2018  we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california the valuation allowances were 200 million and 114 million at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively 

we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions   

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our critical accounting estimates include

 we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this 2018 form 10k for additional information regarding our accounting policies 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations we allocate revenue from multipleelement arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices based on our best estimate of selling price our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straightline basis over the term of the contract when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet 

inventory valuation  our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty  we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

equitybased compensation employee stock plans  we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units “rsus” excluding marketbased performance rsus based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant discounted for dividends we estimate the fair value of our marketbased performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant we amortize the fair value of equitybased awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straightline method of amortization we estimate expected equity award forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rate activity and expected future employee turnover we recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rate if any in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate 

income taxes  deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate

realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determined that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made likewise if we later determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

longlived assets  we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we will perform an impairment test at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or our failure to reach internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value further the value assigned to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

for other longlived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value if the sum is less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this 2018 form 10k 

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 52 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2018  compared to 63 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2017  this decrease was primarily due to common stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program approximately 41 billion and 48 billion of our total cash and investments as of june 24 2018  and june 25 2017  respectively was held outside the united states in our foreign subsidiaries the majority of which was held in us dollars us taxes have already been provided for due to us tax reform as discussed in note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this 2018 form 10k 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 27 billion  during fiscal year 2018  consisted of in millions

liquidity 

given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook combined with our current levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of june 24 2018  are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements capital expenditures capital redistributions and dividends through at least the next twelve months however uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry as well as disruptions in

credit markets have in the past and could in the future impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us

 item 9a controls and procedures 

design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with rule 13a15 of the exchange act in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 24 2018  we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of june 24 2018  at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal controls — integrated framework used by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 24 2018  at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part ii item 8 of this 2018  form 10k

portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development “rd” programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  were 10 billion  914 million  and  825 million  respectively the majority of rd spending over the past three years has been targeted at deposition etch singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing products we believe current challenges for customers at various points in the semiconductor manufacturing process present opportunities for us 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs support our growth strategy and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service 

our marketing sales and service efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet their needs these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions for their wafer processing needs we maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of service engineers in place throughout the united states china europe japan korea southeast asia and taiwan we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace 

we provide standard warranties for our systems the warranty provides that systems will be free from defects in material and workmanship and will conform to agreedupon specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired 

international sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls compliance with us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions and economic and political conditions any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows for geographical reporting revenue is attributed to the geographic location in which the customers’ facilities are located revenue by region was as follows 



longlived assets

customers 

our customers include all of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities customers accounting for greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal year 2017  included micron technology inc samsung electronics company ltd sk hynix inc taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and toshiba inc customers accounting for greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal year 2016  included micron technology inc samsung electronics company ltd sk hynix inc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd customers accounting for greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal year 2015  included micron technology inc samsung electronics company ltd and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 

a material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for ics and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements and forecasts in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months in order for spares and services to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and 2 delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not to exceed 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes as of june 25 2017  and june 26 2016  our backlog was 21 billion  and 14 billion  respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations mainly consist of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers the assembly and testing of our products is conducted predominately in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and costeffective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violations fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 10 2017  we had approximately 9400 regular employees globally although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources targeted to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity defect control customer support and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements and similar factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of competition from thirdparty spare parts providers 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitor in the tungsten cvd pecvd hdpcvd ecd and pvd markets is applied materials inc in the pecvd market in addition to applied materials inc we also compete against asm international and wonik ips in the etch market our primary competitors are applied materials inc hitatchi ltd and tokyo electron ltd and our primary competitors in the wet clean market are screen holding co ltd semes co ltd and tokyo electron ltd 

we face competition from a number of established and emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics and to provide more comprehensive offerings of products if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected strategic investments to encourage local semiconductor manufacturing and supply chain in china could increase competition from domestic equipment manufacturers in china there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k “ 2017  form 10k” the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and periods of rapid growth or decline we therefore face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand the industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities 

during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures for training and managing our workforce and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment resulting in excess fixed costs 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits with the consolidation of customers within the industry the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers the economic political and business conditions occurring nationally globally or in any of our key sales regions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result changing business or economic conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues operating results and earnings where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in rd and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are variable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to

 we may incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business units could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets if in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value as determined by our market capitalization is less than the book value of our assets this could also indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations 

our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

we have 29 billion  in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and convertible note instruments outstanding additionally we have 750 million available to us in revolving credit arrangements with an option for us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional 250 million for a potential total commitment of 10 billion we may in the future decide to borrow amounts under the revolving credit agreement or to enter into additional debt arrangements 

in addition we have entered and in the future may enter into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments 

our indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows particularly in the united states to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we

lam research corporation 2017 10k   16 

  

determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

conversion of our convertible notes and the exercise of the related warrants may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share the number of shares of our common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible and for which related warrants are exercisable for may be adjusted from time to time including increases in such rates as a result of dividends that we pay to our stockholders upon conversion of any convertible notes we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the convertible notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our stockholders this dilution may not be completely mitigated by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of certain convertible notes or through share repurchases prior to the maturity of the convertible notes if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price us generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count which would result in lower reported earnings per share the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain and any of our other future similar agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes the convertible notes or our other debt which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments cash flows collections and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us compliance with specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results

we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products or existing products have reliability quality design or safety problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace for more than 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver could be approaching its technological limit leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies to invest in or acquire such business or technologies and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect particularly as we seek to invest or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us we may find that acquisitions are not available to us for regulatory or other reasons and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions pursuing development through collaboration andor joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management including those related to aligning business objectives sharing confidential information and intellectual property sharing value with third parties and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with nextgeneration devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products our products are priced up to approximately 10 million per system as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by

lam research corporation 2017 10k   18 

  

in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products andor product capabilities this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers reevaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors’ products andor gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property 

similarly our customers may partner with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select our equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect 

outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations field installation and support and many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure  events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships 

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities 

our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or manmade disasters terrorist activities disruptions of our information technology resources and utility interruptions such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products

which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry we may face increasing competitive pressures other companies continue to develop systems andor acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers’ needs to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products andor product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours in addition we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match in many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales as reflected in part 1 item 1 business accounted for approximately 92  92  and 83  of total revenue in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to

 certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china japan korea taiwan and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions this would adversely affect our business with china japan korea andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits in addition there are risks that the chinese government may among other things insist on the use of local suppliers compel companies that do business in china to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights andor local manufacturing and provide special incentives to governmentbacked local customers to buy from local competitors even if their products are inferior to ours all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins 

we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won currently we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro and korean won in addition we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities primarily thirdparty accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in these currencies 

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes can usually only be made with onshore cash balances since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may impact certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills experiences and competencies this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions as well as increasing geographic expansion that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring

depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs global economic or political and industry conditions our organizational structure global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees the availability of career development opportunities the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business that are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include but are not limited to telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors contractors and cloud providers many of these information systems and outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for storage of confidential data and data processing eg companyrelated whether intellectual property or not customerrelated supplierrelated andor employeerelated employ cloud technology for such storage and data processing which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored or processed within the user’s physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an internetbased service all of these information systems are subject to disruption breach or failure from sources including but not limited to attacks degradation and failures resulting from potential sources including viruses malware denial of service destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment confidential andor sensitive information stored on these information systems or transmitted to or from cloud storage could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised lost andor stolen while we have implemented iso 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software intrusion prevention systems access control and emergency recovery processes to mitigate the outlined risks with respect to information systems that are under our control they cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and may be breached our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time or unauthorized releases of proprietary or confidential information could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

we have experienced cyber attacks although past attacks have not resulted in a material adverse effect we may incur material losses related to cyber attacks in the future the insurance we carry may not fully compensate us for the effects of potential losses arising from a cyberrelated incident cyberrelated incidents could result in 

 our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent

on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production andor cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations acquire significant additional equipment incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations or take other actions any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies for regulatory or other reasons we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses products or technologies resulting in significant financial costs reduced or lost opportunities and diversion of management’s attention managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions or may subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors these and other factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other thirdparty claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the us or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties of ours or even of our own employees additionally intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages moreover because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to 1 new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate 2 disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and 3 the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation immigration or travel regulations and antitrust regulations among others each of these laws rules and regulations imposes costs on our business including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance and may present risks to our business including potential fines restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased selling general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition andor results of operations could be adversely affected 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014 our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and in the case of dividends periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements availability of onshore cash flow and changes to our business model our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

executive summary 

lam research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 35 years our vision is to realize full value from natural technology extensions of our company our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory foundry and idms that make products such as nvm dram memory and logic devices we aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success our core technical competency is integrating hardware process materials software and process control enabling results on the wafer 

our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller faster and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products including mobile phones personal computers servers wearables automotive devices storage devices and networking equipment 

semiconductor manufacturing our customers’ business involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer this involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale along with meeting technical requirements wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be costeffective 

demand from the cloud   iot and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost  efficient semiconductors at the same time there are growing technical challenges with traditional twodimensional scaling these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like 3d architectures as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks 

we believe we are in an strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition   etch and singlewafer clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us our focus on research and development with a breadth of programs across sustaining engineering product and process development and concept and feasibility our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base and our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners 

during the most recent fiscal year demand for our products improved as semiconductor device manufacturers particularly non volatile memory and foundry customers made capacity and technology investments technology inflections in our industry including nvm multiple patterning finfet and advanced packaging have led to an increase in our served addressable market for our products in deposition etch singlewafer clean and customer service business we believe that demand for our products and services should increase faster than overall spending on wafer fabrication equipment as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas and we continue to gain market share 

in october 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with klatencor on october 5 2016 we announced that the parties mutually agreed to terminate that agreement

the following summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below 



revenues in fiscal year 2017  increased 36  compared to fiscal year 2016  and revenues in fiscal year 2016  increased 12  compared to fiscal year 2015  reflecting a continuous increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to higher revenue and improved factory utilization resulting from higher production volume 

fiscal year 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal year 2015 improved primarily due to a more favorable customer and product mix 

operating expenses in fiscal year 2017  increased as compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily as a result of continued investments in research and development including the effect of increased employee headcount partially offset by a decrease in acquisitionrelated costs associated with the terminated agreement with klatencor 

operating expenses in fiscal year 2016  increased as compared to fiscal year 2015  primarily as a result of continued investments in research and development and increased employee headcount fiscal year 2016  also included 51 million of acquisitionrelated costs associated with the terminated agreement with klatencor 

our cash and cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 63 billion  as of june 25 2017  compared to 71 billion  as of june 26 2016  cash flow provided from operating activities was 20 billion  for fiscal year 2017  compared to 14 billion  for fiscal year 2016  cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal 2017  was primarily used for 17 billion  of principal payments on debt instruments 812 million  in treasury stock purchases 243 million  in dividends paid to our stockholders and 157 million  of capital expenditures and are partially offset by 73 million  of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equitybased compensation programs 

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

shipments for fiscal year 2017  were approximately 86 billion  an increase of 46  compared to fiscal year 2016    shipments for fiscal year 2016  were approximately 59 billion  an increase of 8 compared to fiscal year 2015 the increase in shipments during the fiscal year 2017  as compared to the last two fiscal years is related to continued strengthening of customer demand for semiconductor equipment

the percentage of total lam semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the markets we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015    



our shipments to memory customers during fiscal year 2017 was largely unchanged compared to fiscal year 2016 foundry spending increased due to higher investments at leadingedge process nodes 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 25 2017  were approximately 21 billion  an increase from approximately 14 billion  as of june 26 2016  our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog 

revenue 



the revenue increases in fiscal year 2017  compared to the last two fiscal years and in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 reflect an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region our deferred revenue balance was 966 million as of june 25 2017  compared to 566 million as of june 26 2016  our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 397 million as of june 25 2017  compared to 132 million as of june 26 2016

gross margin 



the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to higher revenue and improved factory utilization resulting from higher production volume 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to a more favorable customer mix and product mix additionally there was a 10 million impairment charge of a longlived asset in fiscal year 2015 

research and development 



we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge deposition plasma etch single wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to an 80 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount a 20 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance a 9 million increase in outside services and a 7 million increase in supplies 

the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a 36 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount a 14 million increase in facility and information technology related spending a 14 million increase in supplies a 12 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance and an 8 million increase in costs associated with campus consolidation 

selling general and administrative 



the increase in selling general and administrative “sga” expense during fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to a 36 million increase in employee compensation and benefits from increased headcount a 15 million gain from sale of assets in fiscal year 2016 and a 14 million increase in outside services offset by a 41 million decrease in acquisitionrelated costs associated with the terminated agreement with klatencor

lam research corporation 2017 10k   35 

  

the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to 51 million of klatencor acquisitionrelated costs and a 3 million increase in restructuring charges this increase was offset by a 15 million gain on sale of assets net of associated exit costs 

goodwill impairment 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal year 2015 resulted in a noncash impairment charge upon our singlewafer clean reporting unit of 79 million extinguishing the goodwill ascribed to the reporting unit uncertainty surrounding future revenue growth in certain products resulted in the estimated discounted cash flow falling below the carrying value of the goodwill balance there were no impairment charges in fiscal year 2017 or 2016 

other expense net 

other expense net consisted of the following 



interest income increased in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 primarily as a result of higher average cash and investment balances as well as higher yield 

the decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the retirement of the 2016 convertible note the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the 10 billion  senior note issuance in march 2015 combined with the note issuance cost amortization related to the october 2015 bridge financing arrangement 

the gain on deferred compensation plan related assets in fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss in fiscal year 2016 and gain in fiscal year 2015 was driven by a rally in the fair market value of the underlying funds at year end 

loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2017 related to the special mandatory redemption of our 2023 and 2026 notes as well as the termination of the amended and restated term loan agreement following the termination of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with klatencor

income tax expense 



the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the change in the mix of income offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits 

the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the tax benefit of the altera court ruling discussed in more detail below higher income in lower tax jurisdictions and an increased federal tax benefit due to a retroactive and permanent extension of federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2016 

in july 2015 the us tax court the “court” issued an opinion favorable to altera corporation “altera” with respect to altera’s litigation with the internal revenue service “irs” the litigation relates to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement with altera’s foreign subsidiary in its opinion the court accepted altera’s position of excluding stockbased compensation from its intercompany costsharing arrangement however the us department of the treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stockbased compensation from its regulations we have evaluated the opinion and as a result of such evaluation have recorded a tax benefit of 88 million related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stockbased compensation costs we have also recorded a tax benefit of 11 million related to stockbased compensation expense in addition we have recorded a tax liability of 74 million for the us tax cost of potential repatriation of the associated contingent foreign earnings because at this time we cannot reasonably conclude that we have the ability and the intent to indefinitely reinvest these contingent earnings we will continue to monitor this matter and related potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states please refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets were 546 million and 465 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of 585 million and 429 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016 respectively and a valuation allowance of 114 million and 102 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016 respectively the change in the gross deferred tax assets gross deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to an increase related to allowances and reserves and an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to an accrual for future tax liabilities due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 

as of our fiscal year end of june 25 2017 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california we also recorded a valuation allowance on certain state tax credits and continue to record valuation allowances on certain foreign entities’ net operating losses the valuation allowances were 114 million and 102 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016 respectively 

we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any

uncertain tax positions   

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law and effectively settled issues under audit such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our critical accounting estimates include 

 we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accounting policies 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations we allocate revenue from multipleelement arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices based on our best estimate of selling price our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straightline basis over the term of the contract when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet 

inventory valuation  our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than

lam research corporation 2017 10k   38 

  

cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty  we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

equitybased compensation employee stock purchase plan “espp” and employee stock plans  we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units “rsus” excluding marketbased performance rsus based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant discounted for dividends we estimate the fair value of our marketbased performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using a blackscholes option valuation model this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award we amortize the fair value of equitybased awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straightline method of amortization we estimate expected equity award forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rate activity and expected future employee turnover we recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rate if any in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate 

income taxes  deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

longlived assets  we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we will perform an impairment test at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit

discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or our failure to reach internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value further the value assigned to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

for other longlived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value if the sum is less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 63 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2017  compared to 71 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2016  this decrease was primarily due to the redemption of our senior notes with contractual maturities in 2023 and 2026 approximately 48   billion and 31 billion of our total cash and investments as june 25 2017  and june 26 2016  respectively was held outside the united states in our foreign subsidiaries the majority of which is held in us dollars and substantially all of which would be subject to tax at us rates if it were to be repatriated refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the united states

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 20 billion  during fiscal year 2017  consisted of in millions 



significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following uses of cash increases in accounts receivable of 411 million  inventories of 308 million  and prepaid expenses and other assets of 27 million  partially offset by the following sources of cash increases in accounts payable of 127 million  deferred profit of 258 million  and accrued expenses and other liabilities of 50 million  

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2017  was 21 billion  primarily consisting of net purchases of availableforsale securities of 19 billion  and capital expenditures of 157 million  

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2017  was 26 billion  primarily consisting of 17 billion  of cash paid for debt extinguishment 812 million  in treasury stock repurchases and 243 million  of dividends paid partially offset by 73 million  of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stockbased compensation plans 

liquidity 

given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook combined with our current levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of june 25 2017  are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements capital expenditures capital redistributions and dividends through at least the next 12 months however uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry as well as disruptions in credit markets have in the past and could in the future impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances in 

the united states and offshore we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 25 2017  our mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “other income expense” in our consolidated statement of operations all of our other investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

interest rate risk 

fixedincome securities 

our investments in various interestearning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixedincome investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and concentration risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixedincome securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 25 2017 were as follows 



we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification

longterm debt 

as of june 25 2017  we had 29 billion  in principal amount of fixedrate longterm debt outstanding with a fair value of 58 billion  the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature as applicable generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise additionally the fair value of the convertible notes will increase as our common stock price increases and decrease as our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes 

equity price risk 

publicly traded securities 

the values of our investments in publicly traded securities including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans are subject to market price risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 15 or 25 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of june 25 2017  were as follows 



foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily cash thirdparty accounts receivable accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily on revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won 

to protect against the reduction in value of anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain nonusdollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily cash thirdparty accounts receivable accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 25 2017  are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges

interest rate contracts 

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floatingrate debt interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 26 2016 we entered into a series of interest rate contracts with a total notional value of 400 million where we received fixed rates and paid variable rates based on certain benchmark interest rates such interest rate swap arrangements were designated as fair value hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt instrument 

the following table shows the change in fair value of these fair value hedges assuming a hypothetical benchmark interest rate movement of plus or minus 10 bps and plus or minus 15 bps 



interest rate risk is also present on anticipated issuances of debt we manage our interest rate exposure on anticipated issuances of debt through forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in future interest payments that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates prior to the issuance of the debt accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the interest cash flows of the company’s anticipated debt issuances which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements during the fiscal year ended june 26 2016 we entered into and settled a series of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of 600 million associated with our june 2016 debt offering such forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements were designated as hedges of the cash flows associated with benchmark interest rates underlying future interest payments on the june 2016 debt issuances

 item 9a controls and procedures 

design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with rule 13a15 of the exchange act in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 25 2017  we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of june 25 2017  at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal controls — integrated framework used by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 25 2017  at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part ii item 8 of this 2017  form 10k

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements and forecasts in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months in order for spares and services to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and 2 delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not to exceed 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes as of june 26 2016  and june 28 2015  our backlog was 1371 million  and 880 million  respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations mainly consist of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violations fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 10 2016 we had approximately 7500 regular employees globally although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information

in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity defect control customer support and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements and similar factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of competition from thirdparty spare parts providers 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitor in the tungsten cvd pecvd hdpcvd ecd and pvd markets is applied materials inc in the pecvd market in addition to applied materials inc we also compete against asm international and wonik ips in the etch market our primary competitors are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc our primary competitors in the singlewafer wet clean market are screen holding co ltd semes co ltd and tokyo electron ltd 

certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do in addition we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics and to provide more comprehensive offerings of products if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k “ 2016  form 10k” the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and as a result we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand the industry environment has moved toward an environment more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities 

during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems procedures for training and managing our work force and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits with the consolidation of customers within the industry the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers global economic and business conditions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

  

 fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues operating results and earnings where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in rd and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are variable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to

 we may incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business units could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets if in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value as determined by our market capitalization is less than the book value of our assets this could also indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations during the 2015  fiscal year our goodwill and longlived asset impairment assessments resulted in an impairment charge of 794 million  associated with the singlewafer clean reporting unit and 98 million  related to an intangible asset 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations 

our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

we have 455 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and convertible note instruments outstanding if the anticipated acquisition of klatencor is not completed on or prior to december 30 2016 or the related merger agreement is terminated on or at any time prior to that date the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes issued in june 2016 requires us to redeem 16 billion of those senior unsecured notes at a redemption price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued interest in addition in connection with the acquisition of klatencor we have also entered into a term loan agreement with certain term lenders pursuant to which the term lenders have agreed to provide a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate amount of up to 153 billion subject to certain terms and conditions if the anticipated acquisition of klatencor is not completed on or prior to october 20 2016 we will need to obtain consent from all of the lenders under the term loan agreement to extend their commitments past this date additionally we have 750 million available to us in revolving credit arrangements with an option for us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional 250 million for a potential total commitment of 1 billion we may in the future decide to borrow amounts under the revolving credit agreement or to enter into additional debt arrangements 

in addition we have entered and in the future may enter into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments 

our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows particularly in the united states to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

conversion of our convertible notes and resulting exercise of the related warrants may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share the number of shares of our common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible for and the related warrants are exercisable for may be adjusted from time to time including increases in such rates as a result of dividends that we pay to our stockholders upon conversion of any convertible notes we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the convertible notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our stockholders this dilution may not be completely mitigated by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of certain convertible notes or through share repurchases prior to the maturity of the convertible notes if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price us generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count which would result in lower reported earnings per share the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain and any of our other future similar agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes the convertible notes or our other debt which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments cash flows collections and profitability for the years ended june 26 2016  june 28 2015  and june 29 2014  three customers collectively accounted for 45  51  and 52  of total revenue respectively as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us compliance with specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and

limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products or existing products have reliability quality design or safety problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace for over 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver could be approaching its technological limit leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products our products are priced up to approximately 97 million per system and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon customer acceptance of a limited number of systems as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to

additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers reevaluating their future supplier relationships to consider other competitors’ products andor gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property 

similarly our customers may partner with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select our equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect 

outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations field installation and support and many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure  events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships 

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities 

our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or manmade disasters terrorist activities disruptions of our information technology resources and utility interruptions such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry we may face increasing competitive pressures other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers needs to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 92  83  and 86  of total revenue in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to

lam research corporation 2016 10k   19 

  

 certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china taiwan japan south korea and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions this would adversely affect our business with china taiwan japan andor south korea and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits in addition there are risks that the chinese government may among other things insist on the use of local suppliers compel companies that do business in china to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights andor local manufacturing and provide special incentives to governmentbacked local customers to buy from local competitors even if their products are inferior to ours all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins 

we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won currently we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions for these currencies 

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes can usually only be made with onshore cash balances since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may impact certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if

we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business which are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors many of these information systems and outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data eg company related whether intellectual property or not customer related supplier related and  or employee related storage employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user’s physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an internetbased service all of these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment confidential andor sensitive information stored on these information systems or transmitted to or from cloud storage could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised lost andor stolen while we have implemented iso 27001 compliant security procedures such as virus protection software intrusion prevention system and emergency recovery processes to mitigate the outlined risks with respect to information systems that are under our control they cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time or unauthorized releases of proprietary or confidential information could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations acquire significant additional equipment incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations or take other actions any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies as with our proposed acquisition of klatencor or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product

technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties of ours or even our own employees additionally intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages moreover because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to i new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate ii disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and iii the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation and antitrust regulations among others each of these laws rules and regulations imposes costs on our business including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance and may present risks to our business including potential fines restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and

changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased selling general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition andor results of operations could be adversely affected 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014 our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability in the case of share repurchases contractual restrictions and in the case of dividends periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements availability of onshore cash flow and changes to our business model our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts we currently are restricted from repurchasing our common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend pursuant to the klatencor merger agreement a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

if we are unable to complete our contemplated acquisition of klatencor corporation our expected financial results and the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected 

on october 20 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization the “merger agreement” with klatencor to acquire all of klatencor’s issued and outstanding stock through a merger of klatencor with our subsidiaries topeka merger sub 1 inc and topeka merger sub 3 inc as assignee of topeka merger sub 2 inc the “merger” consummation of the merger is subject to customary conditions to closing including the receipt of required regulatory approvals if any condition to the merger is not satisfied or waived the merger will not be completed we and klatencor also may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances any or all of the preceding could jeopardize our ability to consummate the merger on the already negotiated terms to the extent the merger is not completed for any reason we would have devoted substantial resources and management attention to the transaction without realizing the accompanying benefits expected by our management and our financial condition and results of operations and the market value of our stock may be adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties associated with the merger include

with our employees customers distributors suppliers or other business partners may impair our ability to continuously innovate to meet the industry inflections and may result in a loss of or a substantial decrease in purchases by our customers 

even if the klatencor merger is consummated we may not be able to integrate the business of klatencor successfully with our own or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the merger involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public companies the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices with those of klatencor potential difficulties that the combined company may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 

in addition we have operated and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in 

 

any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company 

the future results of the combined company will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the merger 

following the merger the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our or klatencor’s business the combined company’s future success depends in part upon its ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger 

the combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the merger with and the integration of klatencor 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger with and the integration of klatencor there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that may need to be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing marketing and benefits while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond our or their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration expenses likely will result in the combined company taking significant

charges against earnings following the completion of the merger and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present 

the merger may result in a loss of customers or strategic alliances 

as a result of the merger some of the customers potential customers or strategic partners of ours or klatencor may terminate or scale back their business relationship with the combined company some customers may not wish to source a larger percentage of their needs from a single company or may feel that we or klatencor as applicable and thus the combined company is too closely allied with one of their competitors potential customers or strategic partners may delay entering into or decide not to enter into a business relationship with the combined company because of the merger if customer relationships or strategic alliances are adversely affected by the merger the combined company’s business and financial performance could suffer 

third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts with klatencor 

klatencor has contracts with suppliers distributors customers licensors licensees lessors and other business partners that have “change of control” or similar clauses that allow the counterparty to terminate or change the terms of their contract upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement we or klatencor may seek to obtain consent from these other parties but if these third party consents are not obtained or are obtained on unfavorable terms the combined company may lose the benefit of such contracts including benefits that may be material to the business of the combined company 

our indebtedness following completion of the merger will be substantially greater than our indebtedness on a standalone basis and greater than our and klatencors combined indebtedness existing prior to the merger this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and will increase our borrowing costs downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition andor operating results 

we intend to fund the cash component of the merger consideration and related fees and expenses and to prepay klatencor’s term loan with a combination of the combined companies’ balance sheet cash and proceeds of approximately 4 billion under the term loans the revolving credit agreement and debt securities in connection with the anticipated klatencor merger we also expect to offer to holders of klatencors outstanding 25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes the klatencor senior notes new series of our senior unsecured notes in exchange for the klatencor senior notes our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio following completion of the merger in comparison to that prior to the merger will have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will increase our borrowing costs in addition the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness or that of klatencor individually prior to the merger the increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for our investments in product development as well as capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and as a result our cost of capital our ratings reflect each rating agencys opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to our insureds each of the ratings agencies reviews our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition andor operating results 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the financing we intend to use to pay the cash portion of the consideration for the merger 

we have 1 entered into a senior unsecured term loan agreement which provides up to 153 million in term loans subject to certain conditions and 2 issued 24 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes we have also entered into an amendment and restatement of our existing revolving credit agreement pursuant to which among other things the revolving lenders agreed to increase their aggregate commitments under the revolving credit agreement from 300 million to 750 million

we intend to fund the cash component of the merger consideration and related fees and expenses and to prepay klatencor’s outstanding term loans with a combination of the combined companies’ balance sheet cash and proceeds of approximately 4 billion under the term loans from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and the revolving credit agreement 

the availability of the term loans is subject to certain conditions precedent and will terminate on october 20 2016 if the merger has not been consummated by such date in addition if the merger with klatencor is not completed on or prior to december 30 2016 or if the merger agreement is terminated on or prior to such date we will be required to redeem 16 billion principal amount of senior notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption feature of such notes 

our obligation to complete the merger is not subject to a financing contingency in the event that we and klatencor were to agree to extend the period of time in which to close the merger beyond october 20 2016 there can be no assurance that we would be able to extend the availability of the term loans beyond that date in the event that the term loans are not available or in the event of the special mandatory redemption of certain of our senior notes other financing may not be available on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all if we are unable to secure alternative financing the merger may not be completed or we could find it necessary to fund the merger related fees and expenses and the prepayment of klatencor’s outstanding term loans from other sources of liquidity or we could be liable to klatencor for breach of the merger agreement in connection with our failure to consummate the merger 

any delay in completing the klatencor merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder 

in addition to the required regulatory clearances the klatencor merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond our and klatencor’s control that may prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion we cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied furthermore the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the klatencor merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring any delay in completing the klatencor merger could cause the combined company not to realize some or all of the synergies that we and klatencor expect to achieve if the klatencor merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame neither we nor klatencor will be obligated to close the klatencor merger if the klatencor merger is not consummated by october 20 2016

executive summary 

lam research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 35 years our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory microprocessors and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of electronics including mobile phones computers tablets wearables automotive features storage devices and networking equipment

lam research corporation 2016 10k   32 

  

our marketleading products are designed to help our customers build the smaller faster and more powerful devices that are necessary to power the capabilities required by end users the process of integrated circuits fabrication consists of a complex series of process and preparation steps and our product offerings in deposition etch and clean address a number of the most critical steps in the fabrication process we leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology andor productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates enhanced yields faster processing time and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes in demand this cyclicality has been mitigated in recent years by market demands and consolidation among our customers with a reduced number of customers variability in their business plans lead to changes in demand for lam’s equipment and services the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices 

during the most recent fiscal year demand for our products improved as semiconductor device manufacturers particularly non volatile memory customers made capacity and technology investments technology inflections in our industry including 3dnand multiple patterning finfet and advanced packaging   have led to an increase in our served addressable market for our deposition and etch products we believe that over the longer term demand for our products should increase as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas and we continue to gain market share 

in october 2015 as further described in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire klatencor corporation 

the following summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below 



fiscal year 2016 revenues increased 12 compared to fiscal year 2015 reflecting an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 11 which was primarily due to a more favorable customer and product mix 

fiscal year 2015 revenues increased 14 compared to fiscal year 2014 reflecting the steady increase in spending on technology inflections the small decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to less favorable product mix partially offset by improved factory utilization due to higher production volumes 

operating expenses in fiscal year 2016 increased as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily as a result of continued investments in research and development and increased employee headcount fiscal year 2016 also included klatencor acquisition related costs 

continues on next page 

lam research corporation 2016 10k   33 

  

operating expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily as a result of continued investments in the nextgeneration research and development in fiscal year 2015 we also recorded a goodwill impairment of approximately 79 million related to our singlewafer clean reporting unit 

our cash and cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 71 billion  as of june 26 2016 compared to 42 billion  as of june 28 2015 this increase was primarily the result of approximately 24 billion proceeds from june 2016 senior notes issuance net of related issuance costs combined with cash flow provided from operating activities cash flow provided from operating activities was 14 billion  for fiscal year 2016 compared to 786 million  for fiscal year 2015 cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal 2016 was primarily used for 4515 million  of principal payments on debt instruments 1584 million  in treasury stock purchases 1904 million  in dividends paid to our stockholders and 1753 million  of capital expenditures and are partially offset by 594 million  of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equitybased compensation programs 

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

shipments for fiscal year 2016 were approximately 59 billion  an increase of 8  compared to fiscal year 2015 shipments for fiscal year 2015 were approximately 55 billion an increase of 20 compared to fiscal year 2014 the increase in shipments during the fiscal year 2016 as compared to the last two fiscal years is related to continued strengthening of customer demand for semiconductor equipment 



the percentage of total semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the markets we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  

  



our shipments to memory customers increased during fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher demand from mobile enterprise and client solid state drives foundry and logic spending decreased due to relatively lower spending levels at leading edge process nodes 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 26 2016  were approximately 1371 million  an increase from approximately 880 million as of june 28 2015  our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog

revenue 



the revenue increase in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the last two fiscal years reflects an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance time lines the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region our deferred revenue balance was 566 million as of june 26 2016  compared to 518 million as of june 28 2015  our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 132 million as of june 26 2016  compared to 164 million as of june 28 2015  

gross margin 



the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to a more favorable customer mix and product mix additionally there was a 10 million impairment charge of a long lived asset in fiscal year 2015 

the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to a less favorable product mix partially offset by improved factory utilization due to higher production volumes

research and development 



we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge deposition plasma etch singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a 36 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount a 14 million increase in facility and information technology related spending a 14 million increase in supplies a 12 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance and an 8 million increase in costs associated with campus consolidation 

the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a 71 million increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation a 12 million increase in supplies a 5 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance and a 6 million increase in outside services 

selling general and administrative 



the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to 51 million of klatencor acquisition related costs and a 3 million increase in restructuring charges this increase was offset by a 15 million gain on sale of assets net of associated exit costs 

the decrease in sga expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to a decrease of 11 million in integration costs a 9 million decrease in costs associated with rationalization of product configurations and an 8 million decrease related to impairment of long lived assets this decrease was offset by an 8 million increase in compensation and benefits expense 

goodwill impairment 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal year 2015  resulted in a noncash impairment charge upon our singlewafer clean reporting unit of 79 million  extinguishing the goodwill ascribed to the reporting unit uncertainty surrounding future revenue growth in certain products resulted in the estimated discounted cash flow falling below the carrying value of the goodwill balance there were no impairment charges in fiscal year 2016 or 2014 

gain on sale of real estate 

during fiscal year 2014  we sold our interest in nonessential property in palo alto california resulting in 135 million in net proceeds and a realized gain of 83 million  from the transaction

other expense net 

other expense net consisted of the following 



interest income increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal years 2015 and 2014 primarily as a result of higher cash and investment balances as well as improvement to yield the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the 1 billion senior note issuance in march 2015 combined with the note issuance cost amortization related to our klatencor acquisition bridge financing facility the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2015 as compared with fiscal years 2014 was primarily due to the 1 billion senior note issuance in the march 2015 quarter 

foreign exchange gains in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures 

the loss on deferred compensation plan related assets net in fiscal year 2016 as compared to similar gains in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was driven by decline in the fair market value of the underlying funds at year end 

other net expense realized during fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to commitment fees related to our revolving loan and term loan commitments other net expense realized during fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a settlement of matters relating to certain investment transactions other net income realized during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain on the disposition of a private equity investment 

income tax expense benefit 



the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the tax benefit of the altera court ruling discussed in more detail below higher income in lower tax jurisdictions and an increased federal tax benefit due to a retroactive and permanent extension of federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2016  

the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions and an increased federal tax benefit in fiscal year 2015 due to a retroactive reinstatement of the second half of fiscal year 2014 federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2015

treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement with altera’s foreign subsidiary in its opinion the court accepted altera’s position of excluding stockbased compensation from its intercompany costsharing arrangement however the us department of the treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stockbased compensation from its regulations we have evaluated the opinion and have recorded a tax benefit of 877 million related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stockbased compensation costs we have also recorded a tax benefit of 112 million related to stockbased compensation expense  in addition we have recorded a tax liability of 736 million for the us tax cost of potential repatriation of the associated contingent foreign earnings because at this time we cannot reasonably conclude that we have the ability and the intent to indefinitely reinvest these contingent earnings we will continue to monitor this matter and related potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states please refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets were 465 million and 311 million at the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 429 million and 318 million at the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively and a valuation allowance of 102 million and 86 million at the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively the change in the gross deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2016 and 2015 is primarily due to an increase related to tax credit carryforwards recognition of a prepaid cost sharing deferred tax benefit related to the altera case ruling and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to amortization of intangible assets offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation of tangible assets convertible debt accretion and an accrual for future tax liabilities due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2016 

as of our fiscal year end of june 26 2016 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california we also recorded a valuation allowance on certain state tax credits and continue to record valuation allowances on certain foreign entities’ net operating losses the valuation allowances were 102 million and 86 million at the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively 

we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law and effectively settled issues under audit such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition our critical accounting estimates include 

 we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accounting policies 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations we allocate revenue from multipleelement arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices based on our best estimate of selling price our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straightline basis over the term of the contract when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet 

inventory valuation  our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision

warranty  we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain a general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

equitybased compensation employee stock purchase plan “espp” and employee stock plans  we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units “rsus” excluding marketbased performance rsus based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant discounted for dividends we estimate the fair value of our marketbased performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using a blackscholes option valuation model this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award we amortize the fair value of equitybased awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straightline method of amortization we estimate expected equity award forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rate activity and expected future employee turnover we recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rate if any in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate 

income taxes  deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is morelikelythannot to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

longlived assets  we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we will perform an impairment test at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash

flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or our failure to reach internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value further the value assigned to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

for other longlived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value if the sum is less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 71 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2016 compared to 42 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2015 this increase was primarily the result of approximately 24 billion net proceeds from the june 2016 debt issuances approximately 31 billion and 22 billion of our total cash and investments as june 26 2016 and june 28 2015 respectively was held outside the united states in our foreign subsidiaries the majority of which is held in us dollars and substantially all of which would be subject to tax at us rates if it were to be repatriated refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain nonus subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the united states 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 14 billion  during fiscal year 2016  consisted of in millions

lam research corporation 2016 10k   41 

  

significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following uses of cash increases in accounts receivable of 1690 million  inventories of 664 million  and prepaid expenses and other assets of 467 million  partially offset by the following sources of cash increases in accounts payable of 416 million  deferred profit of 271 million  and accrued expenses and other liabilities of 1611 million  

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2016  was 5925 million  which was primarily due to net sales and maturities of availableforsale securities of 7988 million  and proceeds on sale of assets of 797 million  offset by net transfers to restricted cash and investments of 1124 million  and capital expenditures of 1753 million  

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2016  was 15957 million  which was primarily due to 23381 million  in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt partially offset by 4515 million  of principal payments related primarily to the maturity of 4500 million of convertible notes in the june quarter 1584 million  in treasury stock repurchases and 1904 million  of dividends paid to stockholders 

liquidity 

given the historical cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based upon our current business outlook we expect that our levels of cash cash equivalents and investments at june 26 2016 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances in 

the united states and offshore we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us

tableend investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 26 2016  our mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “other income expense” in our consolidated statement of operations all of our other investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities 

our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and concentration risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 26 2016  were as follows 

  



we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification

as of june 26 2016  we had 455 billion  in principal amount of fixedrate longterm debt outstanding with a fair value of 588 billion  the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature as applicable generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise additionally the fair value of the convertible notes will increase as our common stock price increases and decrease as our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes 

equity price risk 

publicly traded securities 

the values of our investments in publicly traded securities including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans are subject to market price risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 15 or 25 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of june 26 2016  were as follows 

  



foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses 

we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily on japanese yendenominated revenues and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses 

to protect against the reduction in value of anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain nonusdollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 26 2016  are shown in the table below this table also

interest rate contracts 

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floatingrate debt interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 26 2016 we entered into a series of interest rate contracts with a total notional value of 4000 million where we received fixed rates and paid variable rates based on certain benchmark interest rates such interest rate swap arrangements were designated as fair value hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt instrument 

the following table shows the change in fair value of these fair value hedges assuming a hypothetical benchmark interest rate movement of plusorminus 10 bps and plusorminus 15 bps 



interest rate risk is also present on anticipated issuances of debt we manage our interest rate exposure on anticipated issuances of debt through forward starting interest rate swap agreements forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are used to mitigate our exposure to changes in future interest payments that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates prior to the issuance of the debt accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the interest cash flows of the company’s anticipated debt issuances which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements during the fiscal year ended june 26 2016 we entered into and settled a series of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of 6000 million associated with our june 2016 debt offering such forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements were designated as hedges of the cash flows associated with benchmark interest rates underlying future interest payments on the june 2016 debt issuances

 item 9a controls and procedures 

design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with rule 13a15 of the exchange act in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 26 2016  we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of june 26 2016 at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal controls — integrated framework used by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 26 2016  at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part ii item 8 of this 2016  form 10k

research and development 

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to achieve and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development “rd” programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 were 8252 million 7165 million and 6837 million respectively the majority of rd spending over the past three years has been targeted at deposition etch singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing products we believe current challenges for customers at various points in the semiconductor manufacturing process present opportunities for us 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs support our growth strategy and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service 

our marketing sales and service efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet their needs these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with 

 

individual customers to develop solutions for their wafer processing needs we maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of service engineers in place throughout the united states europe taiwan korea japan china and southeast asia we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace 

we provide standard warranties for our systems the warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to agreedupon specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired 

international sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls compliance with us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions and economic and political conditions any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows for geographical reporting revenue is attributed to the geographic location in which the customers’ facilities are located revenue by region was as follows 

 

 longlived assets 

refer to note 19 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for information concerning the geographic locations of longlived assets 

customers 

our customers include all of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities in fiscal year 2015 three customers micron technology inc samsung electronics company ltd and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd each individually represented greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 the customers individually representing greater than 10 of total assets were samsung electronics company ltd sk hynix inc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 

 

a material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for ics and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements and forecasts in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months in order for spares and services to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and 2 delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not to exceed 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes as of june 28 2015 and june 29 2014 our backlog was 880 million and 866 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations mainly consist of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 16 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violations fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could 

 

require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 6 2015 we had approximately 7300 regular employees globally although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity defect control customer support and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements and similar factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of thirdparty spare parts provider competition 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitor in the tungsten cvd pecvd hdpcvd ecd and pvd markets is applied materials inc in the pecvd market we also compete against asm international and wonik ips in the etch market our primary competitors are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc our primary competitors in the singlewafer wet clean market are screen holding co ltd semes co ltd and tokyo electron ltd 

certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do in addition we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics and to provide more comprehensive offerings of products if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future 

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration 

 

of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed in them our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they alone will not determine our success our success depends principally upon our research and development engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k “2015 form 10k” the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and as a result we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

despite the recent reduction in cyclicality the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand the industry environment has moved toward an environment more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities 

during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems procedures for training and managing our work force and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure 

 

work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ics with the consolidation of customers within the industry the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers global economic and business conditions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues operating results and earnings where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in rd and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

 

 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are variable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business units could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets if in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value as determined by our market capitalization is less than the book value of our assets this could also indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations during the 2015 fiscal year our goodwill and longlived asset impairment assessments resulted in an impairment charge of 794 million associated with the singlewafer clean reporting unit and 98 million related to an intangible asset 

 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations 

our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

as a result of the issuance of our 2020 and 2025 senior notes our 2016 and 2018 convertible notes and the assumption of the 2041 convertible notes in connection with our acquisition of novellus systems inc collectively the “notes” we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past furthermore in march 2014 we entered into an unsecured credit agreement providing us with the ability to borrow up to 300 million and under certain circumstances to increase such availability to 500 million we may in the future decide to borrow amounts under this facility or to enter into additional debt arrangements 

in addition we have entered and in the future may enter into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments 

our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

conversion of our convertible notes and resulting exercise of the related warrants may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share the number of shares of our common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible for and the related warrants are exercisable for may be adjusted from time to time including increases in such rates as a result of dividends that we pay to our stockholders upon conversion of any convertible notes we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the convertible notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our stockholders this dilution may be mitigated to some extent by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the 2016 and 2018 notes or through share repurchases prior to the maturity of the convertible notes if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price us generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count which would result in lower reported earnings per share the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes 

 

 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain and any of our other future similar agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

 our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes the convertible notes or our other debt which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments cash flows collections and profitability for the years ended june 29 2015 june 28 2014 and june 30 2013 three customers accounted for 51 52 and 45 of total revenue respectively as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us compliance to specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products or existing products have reliability quality design or safety problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace for over 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver could be approaching its technological limit leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

 

 

in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems are priced up to approximately 9 million per system and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon customer acceptance of a limited number of systems as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers reevaluating their future supplier relationships to consider other competitors’ products andor gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property 

 

similarly our customers may partner with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select our equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect 

outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships 

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities 

our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or manmade disasters terrorist activities disruptions of our information technology resources and utility interruptions such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time especially if customers are more focused on tool reuse than in the past accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry we may face increasing competitive pressures other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products 

 

we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 83 86 and 80 of total revenue in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of 

 

the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china taiwan japan south korea and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions this would adversely affect our business with china taiwan japan andor south korea and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits in addition there are risks that the chinese government may among other things insist on the use of local suppliers compel companies that do business in china to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights andor local manufacturing and provide special incentives to governmentbacked local customers to buy from local competitors even if their products are inferior to ours all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins 

we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won currently we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either overor underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions for these currencies 

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes can usually only be made with onshore cash balances since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may impact certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned and 

 

maintained by us our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors many of these information systems and outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user’s physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an internetbased service all of these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment confidential andor sensitive information stored on these information systems or transmitted to or from cloud storage could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised lost andor stolen while we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to mitigate the outlined risks with respect to information systems that are under our control they cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time or unauthorized releases of proprietary or confidential information could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations acquire significant additional equipment incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations or take other actions any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of 

 

product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital make acquisitions or subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors these and other factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or 

 

covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties of ours or even our own employees additionally intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages moreover because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to i new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate ii disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and iii the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation and antitrust regulations among others each of these laws rules and regulations imposes costs on our business including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance and may present risks to our business including potential fines restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014 our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and in the case of dividends periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements and changes to our business model our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchase activity could have a negative effect on our stock price

 repurchase of company shares 

on april 29 2014 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 850 million of common stock these repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law repurchases will be funded using our onshore cash and onshore cash generation this repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time as part of our share repurchase program we may from timetotime enter into structured share repurchase arrangements with financial institutions using general corporate funds 

as part of our share repurchase program we may from timetotime enter into structured share repurchase arrangements with financial institutions using general corporate funds 

during the three months ended september 28 2014 we entered into a collared accelerated share repurchase “asr” transaction under a master repurchase arrangement under the asr we made an upfront cash payment of 250 million in exchange for an initial delivery of approximately 32 million shares of our common stock 

the number of shares repurchased was based on the volumeweighted average price “vwap” of the common stock during the term of the asr minus a predetermined discount set at inception of the asr subject to collar provisions that provided a minimum and maximum number of shares that we could repurchase under the agreements the minimum and maximum thresholds for the transaction were established based on the average of the vwap prices for the common stock during an initial hedge period the asr was scheduled to end at any time on or after october 8 2014 and on or before december 8 2014 

the counterparty designated october 9 2014 as the termination date at which time we settled the asr approximately 03 million shares were received at final settlement which represented a weightedaverage share price of approximately 7290 for the transaction period 

 

share repurchases including those under the repurchase program were as follows

executive summary 

lam research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 35 years our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory microprocessors and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of electronics including cell phones computers tablets storage devices and networking equipment 

our marketleading products are designed to help our customers build the smaller faster and more powerful devices that are necessary to power the capabilities required by end users the process of integrated circuits fabrication consists of a complex series of process and preparation steps and our product offerings in deposition etch and clean address a number of the most critical steps in the fabrication process we leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology andor productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates enhanced yields faster processing time and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes in demand this cyclicality has been mitigated in recent years by market demands and consolidation among our customers with a reduced number of customers variability in their business plans may lead to changes in demand for lam’s equipment and services the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices 

demand for our products was strong throughout the fiscal year as semiconductor device manufacturers made capacity and technology investments we expect growth in the overall wafer fabrication equipment market in calendar year 2015 compared to calendar year 2014 related to leading edge investments by our customers technology inflections in our industry including finfet transistors 3d nand multiple patterning and advanced packaging have led to an increase in the deposition and etch market sizes we believe that over the longer term demand for our products should increase as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas and we continue to gain market share

 

the following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below 

 

 fiscal year 2015 revenues increased 14 compared to fiscal year 2014 reflecting the steady increase in technology inflections’ spending as well as incremental market share gains the small decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to less favorable product mix partially offset by improved factory utilization due to higher production volumes 

operating expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily related to continued investments in the nextgeneration research and development in fiscal year 2015 we also recorded a goodwill impairment of approximately 79 million related to our singlewafer clean reporting unit 

our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 42 billion as of june 28 2015 compared to 32 billion as of june 29 2014 this increase was primarily the result of 992 million net proceeds from march 2015 senior notes issuance cash flows provided from operating activities was 786 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to 717 million for fiscal year 2014 cash flows provided from operating activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily used for 573 million in treasury stock purchases 116 million in dividends paid to our stockholders and 198 million of capital expenditures and are partially offset by 66 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equitybased compensation programs 

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

shipments for fiscal year 2015 were approximately 55 billion and increased by 20 compared to fiscal year 2014 shipments for fiscal year 2014 were approximately 46 billion and increased by 23 compared to fiscal year 2013 the increase in shipments during fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 as well as the 

 

increase in shipments during fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 related to continued strengthening of customer demand for semiconductor equipment 

 

 the percentage of total semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the markets we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 

 

 our shipments to memory customers remained strong during fiscal year 2015 driven by mobile and enterprise demands during fiscal year 2014 memory customer demand was higher due to node transitions in memory manufacturing stable pricing for memory and tight industry supply 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 28 2015 were approximately 880 million and increased from approximately 866 million as of june 29 2014 our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog 

revenue 

 

  

the revenue increase in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 reflected an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers the revenue increase in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 reflected increased customer and industry demand our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region our deferred revenue balance was 518 million as of june 28 2015 compared to 362 million as of june 29 2014 our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 164 million as of june 28 2015 compared to 34 million as of june 29 2014 

gross margin 

 

 the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to a less favorable product mix partially offset by improved factory utilization due to higher production volumes 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due to higher business volumes as well as a more favorable product mix additionally the novellus acquisition related inventory fair value impact and cost associated with rationalization of certain product configurations decreased by 78 million and 15 million respectively in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 

research and development 

 

 we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge deposition plasma etch singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a 71 million increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation a 12 million increase in supplies a 5 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance and a 6 million increase in outside services 

the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a 41 million increase in salaries and benefits related to higher headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation offset by a reduction of 7 million in supplies 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

 the decrease in sga expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to an 11 million decrease in integration costs a 9 million decrease in costs associated with rationalization of product configurations and an 8 million decrease related to impairment of long lived assets this decrease is offset by an 8 million increase in compensation and benefits expense 

the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a net increase of 11 million in salaries benefits and incentive compensation 20 million increase in marketing expenses and outside services 7 million in costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations 8 million of impairment of long lived assets and a 5 million cost related to the renewal of our fremont and livermore buildings’ operating leases this increase was offset by a 34 million reduction in integration costs and a 10 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets related to the novellus integration 

goodwill impairment 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal year 2015 resulted in a noncash impairment charge upon our singlewafer clean reporting unit of 79 million extinguishing the goodwill ascribed to the reporting unit uncertainty surrounding future revenue growth in certain products resulted in the estimated discounted cash flow falling below the carrying value of the goodwill balance 

gain on sale of real estate 

during fiscal year 2014 we sold our interest in nonessential property in palo alto california resulting in 135 million in net proceeds and a realized gain of 83 million from the transaction 

other expense net 

other expense net consisted of the following 

 

 the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2015 as compared with fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to the 1 billion senior note issuance in the march 2015 quarter 

foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2015 and 2014 and losses in fiscal years 2013 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures 

 

other net expense realized during fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a settlement of matters relating to certain investment transactions other net income realized during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain on the disposition of a private equity investment other net expenses during fiscal year 2013 included a 4 million otherthantemporary impairment of a public equity investment recognized during the march 2013 quarter 

income tax expense benefit 

 

 the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions and an increased federal tax benefit in fiscal year 2015 due to a retroactive reinstatement of the second half of fiscal year 2014 federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2015 the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the change in the level of income and geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions us income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014 reduced tax benefit in fiscal year 2014 due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit as of december 31 2013 and tax benefits in fiscal year 2013 related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states please refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards were 311 million and 343 million at the end of fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 318 million and 294 million at the end of fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively and a valuation allowance of 86 million and 74 million at the end of fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively the change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2015 and 2014 is primarily due to the reclassification of deferred tax assets as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update 201311 an accrual for future tax liabilities due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2015 and convertible debt accretion offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to amortization of intangible assets 

our fiscal years 2015 and 2014 valuation allowance of 86 million and 74 million primarily relate to california and certain foreign deferred tax assets 

as of our fiscal year end of june 28 2015 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california we also continue to record valuation allowances on certain foreign entities’ net operating losses 

we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law and effectively settled issues under audit such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations we allocate revenue from multipleelement arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices based on our best estimate of selling price our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straightline basis over the term of the contract when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet 

inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer unless specified in the terms of sale title generally transfers at the physical transfer of the products to the freight carriers transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers occurs at the time of customer acceptance 

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated 

 

usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the system we provide standard warranties for our systems we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a systembysystem basis 

while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded as incurred 

equitybased compensation — employee stock purchase plan “espp” and employee stock plans we recognize the fair value of equitybased compensation expense we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units “rsus” excluding marketbased performance rsus based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant discounted for dividends we estimate the fair value of our marketbased performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using a blackscholes option valuation model this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award we amortize the fair value of equitybased awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straightline method of amortization 

we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equitybased compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations we will only recognize a benefit from equitybased compensation in paidincapital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized in addition we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of equitybased compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement rather than through paidincapital we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paidincapital 

income taxes  deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is morelikelythannot to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

 

goodwill and intangible assets the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available 

goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired each component of the company for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date goodwill is assigned to our reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit we test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 

we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we will perform an impairment test at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine based on a qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed as of the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 march 30 2015 resulted in the recognition of a 794 million goodwill impairment charge on our singlewafer clean systems reporting unit we did not record any goodwill impairment in fiscal years 2014 or 2013 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates it is using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor 

 

equipment industry or our failure to reach internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization and to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value further the value assigned to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2013 the fasb released accounting standards update 201311 “presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists” the new standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or other tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law we adopted this standard during the fiscal year without significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2014 the fasb released accounting standards update 20148 “presentation of financial statements and property plant and equipment reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity” the new standard redefines discontinued operations and requires only those disposals of components of an entity including classifications as held for sale that represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations in addition the new standard expands the disclosure requirements of discontinued operations we adopted this standard during the fiscal year without significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb released accounting standards update 20149 “revenue from contracts with customers” to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap the core principle of the standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services the new standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing gaap including identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation we are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using either of two methods i retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within the standard or ii retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per the standard we have not yet selected a transition method and are in the process of determining the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb released accounting standards update 20153 “interest — imputation of interest” the amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts we are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we do not anticipate that adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 42 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015 compared to 32 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014 this increase was primarily the result of 992 million net proceeds from the march 2015 debt issuances approximately 22 billion of 

 

our total cash and investments as of both june 28 2015 and june 29 2014 was held outside the united states in our foreign subsidiaries the majority of which is held in us dollars and of which substantially all would be subject to tax at us rates if it were to be repatriated refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain nonus subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the united states 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 7855 million during fiscal year 2015 consisted of in millions 

 

 significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following uses of cash increases in accounts receivable of 2942 million inventories of 2075 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of 525 million combined with a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 295 million partially offset by the following sources of cash increases in accounts payable of 766 million and deferred profit of 861 million 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2015 was 11061 million which was primarily due to net purchases of availableforsale securities of 9497 million and capital expenditures of 1983 million partially offset by cash proceeds on the sale of business of 412 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2015 was 3785 million which was primarily due to 9922 million in proceeds from issuance of longterm debt partially offset by 5732 million in treasury stock repurchases and 1161 million of dividends paid to stockholders 

liquidity 

given the historical cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based upon our current business outlook we expect that our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 28 2015 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances in 

 

the united states and offshore we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap include our longterm debt which is outlined in the following table our offbalance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table our contractual obligations and commitments as of june 28 2015 relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date the amounts in the table below exclude 203 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement see note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

  

 operating leases 

we lease most of our administrative rd and manufacturing facilities regional salesservice offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases certain of our facility leases for buildings located in fremont and livermore california and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation in addition to amounts included in the table above we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our fremont and livermore facility leases of up to 250 million see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

capital leases 

capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations the amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multiyear periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments including vendorconsigned inventories the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 28 2015 under these arrangements and others for obligations with cancellation provisions 

 

the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided 

longterm debt 

in may 2011 we issued and sold 450 million in aggregate principal amount of 050 convertible senior notes due may 2016 the “2016 notes” at par at the same time we issued and sold 450 million in aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior notes due may 2018 the “2018 notes” at par we pay cash interest at an annual rate of 05 and 125 respectively on the 2016 notes and the 2018 notes on a semiannual basis the 2016 notes and 2018 notes may be converted into our common stock under certain circumstances based on a conversion rate of 160806 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which is equal to a conversion price of approximately 6219 per share of our common stock the conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain corporate events including dividends on our common stock concurrently with the issuance of the notes we purchased convertible note hedges and sold warrants which were structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 2016 notes and 2018 the notes 

in june 2012 with the acquisition of novellus we assumed 700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2625 convertible senior notes due may 2041 the “2041 notes” and collectively with the 2016 notes and the 2018 notes the “convertible notes” we pay cash interest at an annual rate of 2625 on a semiannual basis the 2041 notes may be converted under certain circumstances into our common stock based on a conversion rate of 288585 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which represents a conversion price of approximately 3465 per share of common stock the conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain events including dividends on our common stock 

during the quarterended june 28 2015 the market value of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130 of the convertible notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end as a result the convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal year 2015 

on march 12 2015 we completed a public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due march 15 2020 the “2020 notes” and 500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due march 15 2025 the “2025 notes” together with the 2020 notes the “senior notes” and collectively with the convertible notes the “notes” we will pay interest at an annual rate of 275 and 380 respectively on the 2020 notes and 2025 notes on a semiannual basis on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning september 15 2015 

we may redeem the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of such series “par” plus a “make whole” premium as described in the indenture in respect to the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest before february 15 2020 for the 2020 notes and before december 15 2024 for the 2025 notes we may redeem the senior notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after february 15 2020 for the 2020 notes and on or after december 24 2024 for the 2025 notes in addition upon the occurrence of certain events as described in the indenture we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

during fiscal year 2015 2014 and 2013 we made 15 million 17 million and 22 million respectively in principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases respectively 

revolving credit arrangements 

on march 12 2014 we entered into a 300 million revolving unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that matures on march 12 2019 the facility includes an option for us to subject to certain requirements request an increase in the facility of up to an additional 200 million for a potential total commitment of 500 million 

 

proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is at our option based on i a base rate defined as the greatest of a prime rate b federal funds rate plus 05 or c onemonth libor plus 10 plus a spread of 00 to 05 or ii libor plus a spread of 09 to 15 in each case the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our noncredit enhanced senior unsecured longterm debt principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity additionally we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our rating described above the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 05 to 10 and maintaining unrestricted or unencumbered cash and investments of no less than 10 billion as of june 28 2015 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants 

other guarantees 

we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications as of june 28 2015 we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees 

generally we indemnify under predetermined conditions and limitations our customers for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees 

we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business as of june 28 2015 the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was 155 million we do not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 28 2015 our mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “other income expense” in our consolidated statement of operations all of our other shortterm investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities 

our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and concentration risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in 

 

the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 28 2015 were as follows 

 

 we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

longterm debt 

as of june 28 2015 we had 36 billion in principal amount of fixedrate longterm debt outstanding with a fair value of 39 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature as applicable generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise additionally the fair value of the convertible notes will increase as our common stock price increases and decrease as our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes 

equity price risk 

publicly traded securities 

the values of our investments in publicly traded securities including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans are subject to market price risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 15 or 25 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of june 28 2015 were as follows 

 

  

foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily on japanese yendenominated revenues and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses 

to protect against the reduction in value of anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated and korean wondenominated expenses we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain nonusdollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 28 2015 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent 

 

  

the notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges as of june 28 2015 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent these changes in fair values would be offset in other income expense net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with rule 13a15 of the exchange act in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 28 2015 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal controls — integrated framework used by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 28 2015 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap

thin film deposition 

in leadingedge semiconductor designs metal deposition processes face significant scaling and integration challenges for advanced copper interconnect structures challenges for electrochemical deposition “ecd” include providing complete voidfree fill of high aspect ratio “har” structures with low defectivity and high productivity electroplating of copper and other metals is also used for throughsilicon via “tsv” and wlp applications such as forming conductive bumps and redistribution layers “rdls” these applications require excellent withinwafer uniformity at high plating rates minimal defects and cost competitiveness for tungsten chemical vapor deposition “cvd”atomic layer deposition “ald” processes key requirements are minimizing contact resistance to meet lower power consumption requirements and achieving voidfree fill for narrow nanoscale structures in addition good barrier step coverage at reduced thicknesses relative to physical vapor depositioncvd barrier films is also needed to improve contact fill and reduce resistivity 

in dielectric deposition highproductivity highquality films are needed for a number of critical process steps for example nextgeneration finfet transistor structures and backendofline “beol” selfaligned double patterning require highly conformal film deposition and atomicscale control of film dimensions to ensure device performance the numerous alternating film layers used in new 3d nand designs require exceptional stress and defectivity control and ultrasmooth film deposition plasmaenhanced cvd “pecvd” is often used for these applications as well as for advanced wlp where depositing highquality films without exceeding thermal budgets is essential in addition ald processes are often used to deposit very thin highly conformal films for applications such as multiple patterning for gapfill deposition achieving defectfree fills while maintaining high throughput is essential preferred approaches are to use highdensity plasma cvd “hdpcvd” either as a complete gapfill solution or as a cap over other gapfill technologies to enhance process control and mitigate integration risks lastly innovative postdeposition film treatments such as ultraviolet thermal processing “uvtp” are being used to improve lowk film integrity and increase strain in nitride layers for improved device performance

research and development 

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to achieve and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development “rd” programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 were 7165 million 6837 million and 4446 million respectively the majority of rd spending over the past three years has been targeted at deposition etch singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing products we believe current challenges for customers at various points in the semiconductor manufacturing process present opportunities for us 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs support our growth strategy and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service 

our marketing sales and service efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet their needs these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with 

  

individual customers to develop solutions for their wafer processing needs we maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of service engineers in place throughout the united states europe taiwan korea japan and asia pacific we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace 

we provide standard warranties for our systems the warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to agreedupon specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired 

international sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls compliance with us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions and economic and political conditions any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows for geographical reporting revenue is attributed to the geographic location in which the customers’ facilities are located revenue by region was as follows 

 

 longlived assets 

refer to note 17 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this report for information concerning the geographic locations of longlived assets 

customers 

our customers include all of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 three customers samsung electronics company ltd sk hynix inc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd each individually represented greater than 10 of total revenues 

a material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 

  

semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements and forecasts in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months in order for spares and services to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and 2 delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not to exceed 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes at june 29 2014 and june 30 2013 our backlog was approximately 866 million and 764 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 14 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to 

  

suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 19 2014 we had approximately 6500 regular employees globally although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity defect control customer support and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements and similar factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of thirdparty spare parts provider competition 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc our primary competitors in the singlewafer wet clean market are dainippon screen manufacturing co ltd semes and tokyo electron ltd in the tungsten cvd pecvd hdpcvd ecd and pvd markets our primary competitor is applied materials inc in the pecvd market we also compete against asm international and wonik ips 

certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do in addition we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future 

  

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed in them our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they alone will not determine our success our success depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this 2014 form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the semiconductor equipment industry is subject to fluctuations and as a result we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems procedures for training and managing our work force and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted 

  

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns global economic and business conditions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues operating results and earnings where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in rd and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are variable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of 

  

future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business segments could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets if in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value as determined by our market capitalization is less than the book value of our assets this could also indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating result and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill one or more of our business segments we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations as a result of historical performance and 

  

growth potential our singlewafer clean systems reporting unit may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for this reporting unit differ from our projections 

our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

as a result of the sale of our 2016 and 2018 convertible notes and the assumption of the 2041 convertible notes in connection with our acquisition of novellus systems inc collectively the “notes” we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

conversion of our notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our shareholders this dilution may be mitigated to some extent by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the 2016 and 2018 notes or through share repurchases prior to the maturity of the notes if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price us generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count which would result in lower reported earnings per share the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain and any of our other future similar agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

 our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the notes or our other debt which could 

  

permit the holders to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments cash flows collections and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us compliance to specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability quality or design problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace the expected industry transition to a 450mm platform represents an emerging challenge for our business and our failure to address that transition in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems are priced up to approximately 9 million per system and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon customer acceptance of a limited number of systems as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes some semiconductor manufacturing companies are also consolidating additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers i reevaluating their future supplier relationships to consider other competitors’ products andor ii gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property 

similarly our customers may partner with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select our equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect 

outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or suffer force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail 

  

to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships 

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities 

our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural disasters terrorist attacks disruptions of our information technology resources and utility interruptions such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with the pending merger of two of our largest competitors we may face increasing competitive pressures other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and to therefore increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

  

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 86 of total revenue in fiscal 2014 80 of total revenue in fiscal year 2013 and 83 of total revenue in fiscal year 2012 we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china taiwan japan south korea and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions this would adversely affect our business with china taiwan japan andor south korea and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro currently we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated expenses we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either overor underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary 

  

assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions for these currencies 

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases or the repayment of our convertible notes can usually only be made with cash balances and cash generated onshore since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may limit certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user’s physical infrastructure but instead are delivered to and consumed by the user as an internetbased service all of these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment confidential andor sensitive information stored on these information systems could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised lost andor stolen while we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to mitigate the outlined risks with respect to information systems that are under our control they cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time or unauthorized releases of confidential information could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

  

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing the need for all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital make acquisitions or subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors these and other factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties of ours or even our own employees additionally intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we 

  

do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages moreover because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to i new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate ii disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and iii the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and antitrust regulations among others one of these laws imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals which may have originated from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries in our products this new requirement could affect the pricing sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products in addition there will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any of the covered minerals used in our products our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products financial reform legislation and the regulations enacted under such legislation have also added costs to our business by among other things requiring advisory votes on executive compensation and on severance packages upon a change in control 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors announced its plans to declare a quarterly dividend on april 29 2014 with the first dividend payment paid on july 2 2014 in addition on april 29 2014 we announced that our board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to 850 million of common stock which includes the remaining value available under the prior authorization of 250 million our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and in the case of dividends periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws and changes to our business model our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchase activity could have a negative effect on our stock price

 repurchase of company shares 

on april 22 2013 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250 million of common stock in addition on april 29 2014 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 850 million of common stock which includes the remaining value available under the company’s prior authorization of 250 million these repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law repurchases will be funded using the company’s onshore cash and onshore cash generation this repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

as part of our share repurchase program we may from timetotime enter into structured share repurchase arrangements with financial institutions using general corporate funds such arrangements entered into or settled during the year ended june 29 2014 included the following 

collared accelerated share repurchases 

during the year ended june 29 2014 the company entered into and settled a collared accelerated share repurchase “asr” transaction under a master repurchase arrangement under the asr the company made an upfront cash payment of 75 million in exchange for an initial delivery of 12 million shares of its common stock and a subsequent delivery of 03 million shares following the initial hedge period 

the number of shares to ultimately be repurchased by us is based generally on the volumeweighted average price “vwap” of the common stock during the term of the asr minus a predetermined discount set at inception of the asr subject to collar provisions that provide a minimum and maximum number of shares that we could repurchase under the agreements the minimum and maximum thresholds for the transaction were established based on the average of the vwap prices for the common stock during an initial hedge period at 

  

the conclusion of the asr we could have received additional shares based on the vwap of the common stock during the term of the agreement minus the predetermined fixed discount however the total number of shares received under the asr would not exceed the maximum of 17 million shares 

the counterparty designated october 28 2013 as the termination date at which time we settled the asr no additional shares were received at final settlement which represented a weightedaverage share price of approximately 5040 for the transaction period 

the company accounted for the asr as two separate transactions a as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date and b as a forward contract indexed to its own common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity as such the company accounted for the shares that we received under the asr as a repurchase of our common stock for the purpose of calculating earnings per common share we had determined that the forward contract indexed to the common stock met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification in accordance with the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification and therefore the asr was not accounted for as a derivative instrument as of june 29 2014 the aggregate repurchase price of 75 million was reflected as treasury stock at cost in the consolidated balance sheet 

share repurchases including those under the repurchase program were as follows

executive summary 

lam research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 30 years our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory microprocessors and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of electronics including cell phones computers storage devices and networking equipment 

our marketleading products are designed to help our customers build the smaller faster and more powerefficient devices that are necessary to power the capabilities required by end users the process of integrated circuits fabrication consists of a complex series of process and preparation steps and lam’s product offerings in deposition etch and clean address a number of the most critical steps in the fabrication process we leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates enhanced yields faster processing time and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and subject to business cycles that historically have been characterized by rapid changes in demand more recently with consolidation in the customer base the cyclical behavior appears to have diminished somewhat with a reduced number of customers variability in their business plans may lead to changes in demand for lam’s equipment and services over certain periods the variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices 

demand for our products increased steadily throughout fiscal year 2014 as semiconductor device manufacturers made capacity and technology investments technology inflections have been in industry inflection points that include finfet transistors 3d nand and multiple patterning these technology inflections have led to an increase in the deposition etch and clean market size this increase as well as market share gains in these inflections have contributed to the increased revenue in fiscal 2014 we believe that over the longer term demand for our products should increase as the proportion of customers’ capital expenditures rise in these technology inflection areas and we continue to gain market share 

  

the following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below 

 

 on june 4 2012 we completed our acquisition of novellus systems inc “novellus” results for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 include novellus operations results for fiscal year 2012 include novellus operations from the acquisition date through june 24 2012 lam’s primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue growth and cost synergies 

fiscal year 2014 revenues increased 28 compared to fiscal year 2013 reflecting the increase in technology inflections’ spending as well as incremental market share gains the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a decrease in novellus acquisitionrelated inventory fair value adjustments improved business volumes and product mix operating expenses in fiscal year 2014 increased as compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily related to continued investments in the nextgeneration research and development and customer facing activities 

our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 32 billion as of june 29 2014 compared to 27 billion as of june 30 2013 this increase was primarily the result of 717 million of cash flows from operating activities offset by 245 million in share repurchases this compares to 720 million in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2013 

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

 

 shipments for fiscal year 2014 were approximately 46 billion and increased by 23 compared to fiscal year 2013 shipments for fiscal year 2013 were approximately 37 billion and increased by 39 compared to fiscal year 2012 the increase in shipments during fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 related to continued strengthening of customer demand through fiscal year 2014 the increase in shipments during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 related to having a full year of combined operations with novellus and the strengthening of customer demand in the second half of fiscal year 2013 

  

the percentage of total semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the market segments we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

 during fiscal year 2014 memory customer demand was higher due to node transitions in memory manufacturing stable pricing for memory and tight industry supply 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 29 2014 were approximately 866 million and increased from approximately 764 million as of june 30 2013 our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog 

revenue 

 

 the revenue increase in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 reflected increased customer and industry demand the revenue increase in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 reflected a full fiscal year of operations postacquisition of novellus our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region our deferred revenue balance was 3616 million as of june 29 2014 compared to 3892 million as of june 30 2013 our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 34 million as of june 29 2014 compared to 70 million as of june 30 2013 

gross margin 

 

   

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due to higher business volumes as well as a more favorable product mix additionally the novellus acquisition related inventory fair value impact and cost associated with rationalization of certain product configurations decreased by 78 million and 15 million respectively in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 

the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to higher novellus acquisitionrelated inventory fair value adjustments of approximately 77 million amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately 78 million and 16 million of costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations offsetting these higher novellus acquisition and product configurationrelated expenses was a favorable change in gross margin as a result of increased business volume 

research and development 

 

 we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge deposition plasma etch singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements the increase in rd expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a 41 million increase in salaries and benefits related to higher headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation offset by a reduction of 7 million in supplies 

the increase in rd spending during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 reflects a full year of combined operations with novellus increased rd expense included 111 million in salary and benefits mainly due to higher headcount 46 million in supplies 26 million in depreciation and amortization due to new product development 15 million in outside services and an additional 12 million in rent utilities and repairs

 the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a net increase of 11 million in salaries benefits and incentive compensation 20 million increase in marketing expenses and outside services 7 million in costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations 8 million of impairment of a long lived asset and a 5 million cost related to the renewal of our fremont and livermore buildings’ operating leases this increase was offset by a 34 million reduction in integration costs and a 10 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets related to the novellus integration 

the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to the impact of combined operations with novellus increased expense includes 108 million in salary and benefits 

  

due to a higher headcount 73 million of intangible asset amortization 29 million in integration cost and 14 million in rentrepairutilities all offset by a 47 million decrease in novellus acquisitionrelated cost 

gain on sale of real estate 

during the fiscal year 2014 we sold our interest in nonessential property in palo alto california resulting in 135 million in net proceeds and a realized gain of 83 million from the transaction 

other expense net 

other expense net consisted of the following 

 

 the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2013 as compared with fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the 2041 convertible notes assumed in june 2012 in connection with the novellus acquisition 

foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2014 and losses in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures 

other income realized during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain on the disposition of a private equity investment other expenses during fiscal year 2013 included a 4 million otherthantemporary impairment of a public equity investment recognized during the march 2013 quarter other expenses during fiscal year 2012 included a 2 million otherthan temporary impairment of a private equity investment recognized during the september 2011 quarter 

income tax expense benefit 

 

 the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the change in the level of income and geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions us income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014 reduced tax benefit in fiscal year 2014 due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit as of december 31 2013 and tax benefits in fiscal year 2013 related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 was 

  

primarily due to the level of income tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions and tax benefit due to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in january 2013 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states please refer to note 15 to consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards were 343 million and 318 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 294 million and 259 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively and a valuation allowance of 74 million and 77 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively the change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2014 and 2013 is primarily due to accrual for future tax liability due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014 and amortization of convertible debt offset by increase in deferred tax assets related to accounting allowances and reserves 

our fiscal years 2014 and 2013 valuation allowance of 74 million and 77 million primarily relate to california and certain foreign deferred tax assets 

at our fiscal year end of june 29 2014 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california we also continue to record valuation allowance on certain foreign entities’ net operating losses 

we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on 

  

our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations we allocate revenue from multipleelement arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices provided the elements have value on a standalone basis our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return the maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straightline basis over the term of the contract when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met we record deferred revenue andor deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet 

inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer unless specified in the terms of sale title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance 

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the system we provide standard warranties for our systems we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability trends all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a systembysystem basis 

  

while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded as incurred 

equitybased compensation — employee stock purchase plan “espp” and employee stock plans gaap requires us to recognize the fair value of equitybased compensation in net income we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units “rsus” excluding marketbased performance rsus based on the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant we estimate the fair value of our marketbased performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using the blackscholes option valuation model this model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award we amortize the fair value of equitybased awards over the vesting periods of the awards and we have elected to use the straightline method of amortization 

we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equitybased compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations we will only recognize a benefit from stockbased compensation in paidincapital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized in addition we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stockbased compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement continuing operations rather than through paidincapital we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paidincapital 

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is morelikelythannot that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made 

  

goodwill and intangible assets the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available 

goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired each component of the company for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date goodwill is assigned to the company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit we test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 

we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we would perform an impairment test at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined in our goodwill impairment analysis we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that its fair value is less than its carrying amount our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed as of the first day of our fourth quarter march 31 2014 did not result in a goodwill impairment charge nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013 or 2012 as a result of historical performance and growth potential our singlewafer clean systems reporting unit may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for this reporting unit differ from our projections 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 

under the market approach we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and 

  

assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units we also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or our failure to reach our internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value in addition the value we assign to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2013 the fasb released accounting standards update 201311 “presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists” the new standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or other tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law we are required to adopt this standard starting in fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact if any on our financial position 

in april 2014 the fasb released accounting standards update 20148 “presentation of financial statements and property plant and equipment reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity” the new standard redefines discontinued operations and requires only those disposals of components of an entity including classifications as held for sale that represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations in addition the new standard expands the disclosure requirements of discontinued operations we are required to adopt this standard starting in fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact if any on our financial position 

in may 2014 the fasb released accounting standards update 20149 “revenue from contracts with customers” to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap the core principle of the standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services the new standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing gaap including identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation we are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods i retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within the standard or ii retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per the standard we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our financial position 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 32 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014 compared to 27 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013 this increase was primarily the result of 717 million of cash flow from operating activities approximately 22 billion and 20 billion of our total cash and investments as of june 29 2014 and june 30 2013 respectively were held outside the us in our foreign subsidiaries the majority of which would be subject to tax at us rates if it were to be repatriated refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this report for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain nonus subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the us 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 717 million during fiscal year 2014 consisted of in millions 

 

 significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following uses of cash increases in accounts receivable of 2015 million inventories of 1901 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of 95 million partially offset by the following sources of cash increases in accounts payable of 187 million deferred profit of 109 million and accrued liabilities of 786 million 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2014 was 2652 million which was primarily due to net purchases of availableforsale securities of 2840 million and capital expenditures of 1455 million partially offset by cash proceeds on the sale of assets of 1567 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2014 was 1627 million which was primarily due to 2449 million in treasury stock repurchases partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee equitybased plans of 777 million 

liquidity 

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based upon our current business outlook we expect that our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 29 2014 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

  

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances in the united states and offshore we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap include our longterm debt which is outlined in the following table our offbalance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table our contractual obligations and commitments as of june 29 2014 relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table the amounts in the table below exclude 258 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

  

 operating leases 

we lease most of our administrative rd and manufacturing facilities regional salesservice offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont california headquarters livermore facilities and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation in addition to amounts included in the table above we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our fremont and livermore facility leases of up to 191 million see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

capital leases 

capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations the amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations 

purchase obligations

inventories the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 29 2014 under these arrangements and others for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided 

longterm debt 

on may 11 2011 we issued and sold 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of 05 convertible notes due 2016 the “2016 notes” and 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible notes due 2018 the “2018 notes” and collectively with the “2016 notes” the “notes” the 2016 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 05 per annum and the 2018 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 125 per annum the notes may be converted into our common stock under certain circumstances based on a conversion rate of 159128 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which is equal to a conversion price of approximately 6284 per share of our common stock the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest concurrently with the issuance of the notes we purchased convertible note hedges for 1811 million and sold warrants for 1338 million the separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the notes 

in june 2012 with the acquisition of novellus we assumed 700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2625 convertible senior notes due may 2041 the “2041 notes” the 2041 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2625 per annum the 2041 notes may be converted under certain circumstances into our common stock based on a conversion rate of 285572 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which represents a conversion price of approximately 3502 per share of common stock

revolving credit arrangements 

on march 12 2014 we entered into a 300 million revolving unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that matures on march 12 2019 the facility includes an option for us to subject to certain requirements request an increase in the facility of up to an additional 200 million for a potential total commitment of 500 million proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is at our option based on i a base rate defined as the greatest of a prime rate b federal funds rate plus 05 or c onemonth libor plus 10 plus a spread of 00 to 05 or ii libor plus a spread of 09 to 15 in each case the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our noncredit enhanced senior unsecured longterm debt principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity additionally we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our rating described above the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 05 to 10 and maintaining unrestricted or unencumbered cash and investments of no less than 10 billion as of june 29 2014 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants 

other guarantees 

we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications as of june 29 2014 we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees 

  

generally we indemnify under predetermined conditions and limitations our customers for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees 

we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business as of june 29 2014 the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was 206 million we do not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 29 2014 our mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “other income expense” in our consolidated statement of operations all of our other shortterm investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities 

our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and concentration risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 29 2014 were as follows 

 

   

we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

longterm debt 

as of june 29 2014 we had 16 billion in principal amount of fixedrate longterm debt outstanding with a fair value of 26 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall andor our common stock price increases and decrease as interest rates rise andor our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes 

equity price risk 

publicly traded securities 

the values of our investments in publicly traded securities including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans are subject to market price risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 15 or 25 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of june 29 2014 were as follows 

 

 foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated expenses 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily on japanese yendenominated revenues and eurodenominated expenses 

to protect against the reduction in value of anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yenand eurodenominated expenses we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain nonusdollar denominated monetary assets and

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with rule 13a15 of the exchange act in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 29 2014 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management has used the framework set forth in the 1992 report entitled “internal control — integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 29 2014 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part iv item 15 of this 2014 form 10k

 longlived assets 

refer to note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this report for information concerning the geographic locations of longlived assets 

  

customers 

our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities in fiscal year 2013 three customers samsung electronics company ltd sk hynix inc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd combined represented approximately 46 of total revenues and each customer individually represented greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal year 2012 the same three customers combined represented approximately 50 of total revenues and each customer individually represented greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal year 2011 samsung electronics company ltd represented approximately 24 of total revenues 

a material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months in order for spares and services to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and 2 delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not to exceed 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes at june 30 2013 and june 24 2012 our backlog was approximately 764 million and 870 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 14 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these 

  

products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 20 2013 we had approximately 6600 regular employees although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements and similar factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of thirdparty spare parts provider competition 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc our primary competitors in the singlewafer wet clean market are dainippon screen manufacturing co ltd and tokyo electron ltd in the tungsten cvd pecvd hdpcvd ecd and pvd markets our primary competitor is applied materials inc in the pecvd market we also compete against asm international our primary competitors in the surface preparation product arena are mattson technologies inc and psk inc 

  

certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do in addition we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future 

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed in them our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they alone will not determine our success our success depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this 2013 form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

  

the semiconductor equipment industry is subject to major fluctuations and as a result we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems procedures for training and managing our work force and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns global economic and business conditions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development “rd” and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

our longterm success results of operations and the value of our common stock depend on our ability to successfully combine the novellus business with our preexisting business which may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected 

on june 4 2012 we acquired novellus and we are currently combining novellus’ business with our preexisting business our future success results of operations and the value of our common stock depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition to realize these anticipated benefits we must successfully combine our businesses in an efficient and effective manner and communicate the impact that a business combination will have on our financial statements if we are not able to achieve and clearly communicate these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer than expected to realize and our results of operations and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected 

specific issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of novellus into our preexisting operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized actual synergies if achieved at all may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we are not able to adequately address these challenges we may be unable to successfully integrate the combined company’s operations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain 

  

amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

as a result of the sale of our 2016 and 2018 convertible notes and the assumption of the 2041 convertible notes in connection with the novellus acquisition collectively the “notes” we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it 

  

on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

conversion of our notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our shareholders this dilution may be mitigated to some extent by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the 2016 and 2018 notes prior to the maturity of the notes if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price us gaap requires that we report an increase in diluted share count which would result in lower reported earnings per share the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing increased costs andor lower margins for us such as regional manufacturing expectations compliance to specific environmental social and corporate governance standards and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results as of june 30 2013 two customers accounted for approximately 22 and 14 of accounts receivable as of june 24 2012 three customers accounted for approximately 24 17 and 11 of accounts receivable 

we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability quality or design problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace the expected industry transition to a 450mm platform represents an emerging challenge for our business and our failure to address that transition in a timely manner with productive and costeffective products could adversely affect our business in a material way our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable 

  

markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems are priced up to approximately 9 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a limited number of systems as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter and in the longer term the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products as well this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances and potential customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes while in certain instances this could work to our advantage if our equipment becomes the basis for the function or process as the tool of choice for the larger consolidated customer or alliance it could also work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes 

similarly our customers may team with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines even if they select lam equipment the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

  

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect 

outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks be acquired by third parties become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or suffer force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect 

although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in some cases the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business but this is not feasible in all circumstances there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships 

we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities 

our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural disasters terrorist attacks disruptions of our information technology resources and utility interruptions such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust adversely affecting our business and operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors especially those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give 

  

away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 80 of total revenue in fiscal year 2013 83 of total revenue in fiscal year 2012 and 88 of total revenue in fiscal year 2011 we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china taiwan japan south korea and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions this would adversely affect our business with china taiwan japan andor south korea and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

  

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro currently we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated expenses we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either overor underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions for these currencies 

the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated certain uses of cash such as share repurchases or the repayment of our convertible notes can usually only be made with cash balances and cash generated onshore since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states this may limit certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsource providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment confidential information stored on these information systems could be compromised to the extent that these information systems are under our control we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to mitigate the outlined risks however security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time or unauthorized releases of confidential information could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

  

in addition we have recently merged our global enterprise system with the enterprise system used by novellus systems inc prior to its acquisition by lam combining these two systems was a complex process and there is possibility for error in the merger process while we have exerted considerable efforts to ensure a fully operational system should an error occur there could be a short term adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in an efficient manner 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing the need for all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and 

  

goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital make acquisitions or subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam research from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended 

  

purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications and we keep certain information processes and techniques as trade secrets however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the actions or omissions of third parties or even our own employees additionally even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we may incur impairments to goodwill or long lived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable negative industry or economic trends including reduced market prices of our common stock reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our relevant business segments could lead to impairment charges against our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets if in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value as determined by our market capitalization is less than the book value of our assets this could also indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period which could adversely affect our result of operations 

our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating result and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results additionally if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill one or more of our business segments we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements which could negatively affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to i new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate ii disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade and iii the interpretation and application of laws rules and regulations as a public company with global operations 

  

we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy anticorruption such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and antitrust regulations among others one of these laws imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals which may have originated from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries in our products this new requirement could affect the pricing sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products in addition there will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any of the covered minerals used in our products our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products financial reform legislation and the regulations enacted under such legislation have also added costs to our business by among other things requiring advisory votes on executive compensation and on severance packages upon a change in control 

to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

 repurchase of company shares 

on december 14 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 16 billion of company common stock which replaced the previous repurchase authorizations the company completed the repurchase of all amounts available under this share repurchase authorization during the year ended june 30 2013 

on april 22 2013 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250 million of company common stock these repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law repurchases will be funded using the company’s onshore cash and onshore cash generation this repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

as part of its share repurchase program the company may from timetotime enter into structured share repurchase arrangements with financial institutions using general corporate funds such arrangements entered into or settled during the year ended june 30 2013 included the following 

collared accelerated share repurchases — settled during current fiscal year 

during the year ended june 24 2012 the company entered into two share repurchase transactions under one master repurchase arrangement under these collared accelerated share repurchase transactions “asrs” the company made upfront cash payments of 375 million and 200 million respectively three days after the respective trade date in exchange for an initial delivery of 66 million and 39 million shares of its common stock respectively the number of shares to ultimately be repurchased by the company is based generally on the volumeweighted average price “vwap” of the company’s common stock during the term of the asr minus a predetermined discount set at inception of the asr subject to collar provisions that provide a minimum and maximum number of shares that the company could repurchase under the agreements 

  

the minimum and maximum thresholds for each transaction were established based on the average of the vwap prices for the company’s common stock during an initial hedge period the company received incremental shares on top of the initial shares delivered such that the total number of shares received after the initial hedge period equaled 88 million and 48 million shares equivalent to the minimum number of shares to be delivered under the terms of the asrs respectively the asrs were scheduled to end on or before september 18 2012 and october 9 2012 respectively however each asr was subject to acceleration at the option of the counterparty at any time after june 27 2012 and july 19 2012 respectively at the conclusion of the asrs the company was to receive additional shares based on the vwap of the company’s common stock during the term of the agreement minus the predetermined fixed discount such that the total number of shares received under the asrs would not exceed the maximum of 108 million and 66 million shares respectively 

the company accounted for each asr as two separate transactions a as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date and b as a forward contract indexed to the company’s own common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity as such the company accounted for the shares that it received under the asrs as a repurchase of its common stock for the purpose of calculating earnings per common share the company has determined that the forward contract indexed to the company’s common stock met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification in accordance with the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb asc and therefore the asrs were not accounted for as derivative instruments as of june 24 2012 the aggregate repurchase price of 5750 million was reflected as treasury stock at cost in the consolidated balance sheet 

the counterparty to the 375 million asr designated july 6 2012 as the accelerated termination date at which time the company settled the asr and received an additional 13 million shares of common stock in addition to the minimum shares already received which represented a weighted average share price of approximately 3680 for the transaction period the counterparty to the 200 million asr designated july 25 2012 as the accelerated termination date at which time the company settled the asr and received an additional 07 million shares of common stock in addition to the minimum shares already received which represented a weighted average share price of approximately 3612 for the transaction period 

collared accelerated share repurchases — executed during current fiscal year 

during the year ended june 30 2013 the company entered into a share repurchase transaction under the existing master repurchase arrangement under this asr the company made an upfront cash payment of 864 million in exchange for an initial delivery of 15 million shares of its common stock and a subsequent delivery of 04 million shares following the initial hedge period 

as with the prior asrs the minimum and maximum thresholds for the transaction were established based on the average of the vwap prices for the company’s common stock during an initial hedge period the asr was scheduled to end at any time after march 21 2013 and on or before may 21 2013 at the conclusion of the asrs the company was to receive additional shares based on the vwap of the company’s common stock during the term of the agreement minus the predetermined fixed discount such that the total number of shares received under this asr would not exceed the maximum of 22 million shares 

the counterparty designated may 21 2013 as the termination date at which time the company settled the asr and received an additional 01 million shares of common stock in addition to the minimum shares already received which represented a weighted average share price of approximately 4271 for the transaction period 

as of june 30 2013 the aggregate repurchase price of 864 million is reflected as treasury stock at cost in the consolidated balance sheet 

  

share repurchases including those under the repurchase program were as follows

executive summary 

we design manufacture market refurbish and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory microprocessors and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of consumer and industrial electronics semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits we leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates enhanced yields faster processing time and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and subject to business cycles that historically have been characterized by rapid changes in demand that necessitate adjusting spending and managing capital allocation prudently across business cycles today’s leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns such as electronics demand memory pricing and foundry utilization rates may not be any more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries industry supply and demand prices for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop acquire and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations during any particular period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

demand for our products declined slightly in the first half of fiscal year 2013 as semiconductor device manufacturers delayed certain capacity investments industry conditions started to improve during the second half of fiscal year 2013 as customers increased their investments in semiconductor equipment to support healthy demand we believe that over the long term demand for our products will increase as customers’ capital 

  

expenditures rise to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices particularly in mobile markets and address the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing 

the following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below 

 

 on june 4 2012 we completed our acquisition of novellus systems inc “novellus” results for fiscal year 2013 include novellus operations results for fiscal year 2012 include novellus operations from the acquisition date through june 24 2012 lam’s primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue growth and cost synergies 

fiscal year 2013 revenues increased 35 compared to fiscal year 2012 reflecting a full fiscal year of operations postacquisition of novellus the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisitionrelated inventory fair value adjustments operating expenses in fiscal year 2013 increased as compared to fiscal year 2012 primarily reflecting a full fiscal year of operations postacquisition of novellus and operating expenses related to acquired intangible asset amortization and novellus integration costs 

our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 27 billion as of june 30 2013 compared to 30 billion as of june 24 2012 this decrease was primarily the result of 956 million of share repurchases offset by 720 million in cash provided by operating activities this compares to 499 million in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2012 the increased operating cash flows in fiscal year 2013 versus fiscal year 2012 were primarily the result of higher revenue levels 

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

 

 shipments for fiscal year 2013 were approximately 37 billion and increased by 39 compared to fiscal year 2012 shipments for fiscal year 2012 were approximately 27 billion and decreased by 19 compared to fiscal year 2011 the increase in shipments during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 related to 

  

having a full year of combined operations with novellus and the strengthening of customer demand in the second half of fiscal year 2013 the decrease in shipments during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 related to change in demand for semiconductor equipment especially in the first half of fiscal year 2012 

the percentage of total system shipments to each of the market segments we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 in the december 2011 quarter we modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business these shipments were previously reported in the logicintegrated device manufacturing category 

 

 unshipped orders in backlog as of june 30 2013 were approximately 764 million and decreased from approximately 870 million as of june 24 2012 our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog 

revenue 

 

 the revenue increase in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 reflected a full fiscal year of operations postacquisition of novellus the revenue decrease in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was due to the decrease in customer capacity investments our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region our deferred revenue balance increased to 3892 million as of june 30 2013 compared to 3354 million as of june 24 2012 due to increased customer shipment levels in the second half of fiscal year 2013 our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 70 million as of june 30 2013 compared to 23 million as of june 24 2012 

gross margin 

 

   

the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to higher acquisitionrelated inventory fair value adjustments of approximately 77 million amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately 78 million and 16 million of costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations offsetting these higher acquisition and product configuration related expenses was a favorable change in gross margin as a result of increased business volume 

the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume and less favorable customer and product mix 

research and development 

 

 we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge plasma etch deposition singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements fiscal year 2013 reflects a full year of combined operations with novellus while fiscal year 2012 reflects mainly lam as a standalone entity increased rd expense included 111 million in salary and benefits mainly due to higher headcount 46 million in supplies 26 million in depreciation and amortization due to new product development 15 million in outside services and an additional 12 million in rent utilities and repairs overall rd expenses as a percentage of revenue have increased as a result of technology inflections such as the transition to multipatterning and three dimensional devices 

the increase in rd spending during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to an 18 million increase in salary and benefits as a result of higher headcount a 21 million increase in supplies and an 11 million increase in depreciation related to new product development also included in our results are 11 million of novellusrelated rd expenses that were incurred in the june 2012 quarter from the acquisition date through june 24 2012 

selling general and administrative 

 

 the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to the impact of combined operations with novellus increased expense includes 108 million in salary and benefits due to higher headcount 73 million of intangible asset amortization 29 million in integration cost and 14 million in rentrepairutilities all offset by a 47 million decrease in acquisitionrelated cost 

the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to 63 million in expenses related to the novellus acquisition and integration and 13 million of novellus related sga expenses including 4 million of intangible asset amortization incurred in the june 2012 quarter from the acquisition date through june 24 2012 

  

  

restructuring 

during fiscal year 2011 we incurred restructuring charges of 116 million consisting primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases 

for further details related to restructuring see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 

 

 the increase in interest income during fiscal year 2013 as compared with fiscal year 2012 and during fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to increases in our average cash and investment balances from cash provided by operations and proceeds from convertible note financing which was partially offset by treasury stock transactions and the decrease in interest rate yields 

the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2013 as compared with fiscal year 2012 and during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the issuance of the 900 million convertible notes during may 2011 and the 2041 notes assumed in june 2012 in connection with the novellus acquisition 

foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2013 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures primarily in the japanese yen korean won and taiwanese dollar we incurred insignificant foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2012 related to unhedged balance sheet exposures foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2011 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures primarily in the euro korean won and singapore dollar 

other expenses during fiscal year 2013 increased as compared to fiscal year 2012 primarily due to a 37 million otherthantemporary impairment of a public equity investment recognized during the march 2013 quarter other expenses during fiscal year 2012 increased as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily due to a 17 million otherthan temporary impairment of a private equity investment recognized during the september 2011 quarter and increased charitable contributions 

income tax expense 

our annual income tax expensebenefit was 472 million 357 million and 771 million in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 was 708  175 and 96 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the level of income tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapse of statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions and tax benefit due to the 

  

retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in january 2013 the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the level of income the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions decrease in federal research and development tax credit due to the expiration of the credit on december 31 2011 increase in nondeductible stock based compensation and nondeductible acquisition costs 

international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states please refer to note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards were 3178 million and 2537 million at the end of fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 2593 million and 2856 million at the end of fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively and a valuation allowance of 766 million and 552 million at the end of fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively the change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2013 and 2012 is primarily due to an increase of tax credit attributes resulting from the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2013 resolution of certain tax matters and reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to intangibles and fixed assets 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is morelikelythannot to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed our fiscal years 2013 and 2012 valuation allowance of 766 million and 552 million primarily relate to california and certain foreign deferred tax assets 

at our fiscal year end of june 30 2013 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california we also continue to record valuation allowance on certain foreign entities’ net operating losses 

we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the 

  

reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have received customer acceptance completed our system installation obligations or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations we allocate revenue from multipleelement arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices provided the elements have value on a standalone basis our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return the maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straightline basis over the term of the contract when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met we record deferred revenue andor deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet 

inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer unless specified in the terms of sale title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance 

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market 

  

conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we provide standard warranties for our systems when appropriate we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability trends all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a systembysystem basis 

actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded as incurred 

equitybased compensation — employee stock purchase plan “espp” and employee stock plans gaap requires us to recognize the fair value of equitybased compensation in net income we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units “rsus” based upon the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using the blackscholes option valuation model this model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award we amortize the fair value of equitybased awards over the vesting periods of the awards and we have elected to use the straightline method of amortization 

we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equitybased compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations we will only recognize a benefit from stockbased compensation in paidincapital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized in addition we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stockbased compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement continuing operations rather than through paidincapital we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paidincapital 

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is morelikelythannot that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made 

goodwill and intangible assets the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available 

goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired each component of the company for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date goodwill is assigned to the company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit we test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 

we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we are required to assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined beginning with our fiscal year 2012 goodwill impairment analysis we adopted new accounting guidance that allowed us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform a quantitative analysis under the revised guidance an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that its fair value is less than its carrying amount our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed as of april 1 2013 did not result in a goodwill impairment charge nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2012 or 2011 as a result of historical performance and growth potential our clean systems reporting unit may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for this reporting unit differ from our projections 

  

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 

under the market approach we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units we also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or our failure to reach our internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value in addition the value we assign to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new authoritative guidance that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income “oci” by eliminating the option to present components of oci as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity the amendments in this standard require that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements we adopted this guidance in the september 2012 quarter the implementation of this authoritative guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations but did change the presentation of our financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income the february 2013 update does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements however this update requires an entity to present on the face of the financial statements or in the notes amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification as allowed in the update the company elected to early adopt these disclosure amendments in the quarter ended march 31 2013 the implementation of this update did not impact the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows as it was disclosureonly in nature 

in july 2013 the fasb released accounting standards update 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists 

  

the new standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or other tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law we are required to adopt this standard starting fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact if any on our financial position 

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 27 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013 compared to 30 billion at the end of fiscal year 2012 this decrease was primarily due to share repurchases of 956 million partially offset by cash generated by operations of 720 million approximately 20 billion of our total cash and investments as of june 30 2013 were held outside the us in our foreign subsidiaries of which substantially all would be subject to tax at us rates if it were to be repatriated refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this report for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain nonus subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the us 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 720 million during fiscal year 2013 consisted of in millions 

 

 significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following sources of cash decreases in accounts receivable of 1626 million and inventories of 764 million and an increase in deferred profit of 602 million partially offset by the following uses of cash decreases in accounts payable of 581 million and accrued liabilities of 438 million 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2013 was 2386 million which was primarily due to capital expenditures of 1608 million and net purchases of availableforsale securities of 584 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2013 was 8878 million which was primarily due to 9557 million in treasury stock repurchases partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee equitybased plans of 706 million 

liquidity 

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based 

  

upon our current business outlook we expect that our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 30 2013 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances in the united states and offshore we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap and include our longterm debt which is outlined in the following table and noted below our offbalance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 30 2013 relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table the amounts in the table below exclude 2465 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement see note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

on may 11 2011 we issued and sold 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of 05 convertible notes due 2016 the “2016 notes” and 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible notes due 2018 the “2018 notes” and collectively with the “2016 notes” the “notes” the 2016 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 05 per annum and the 2018 notes were issued at par and pay interest at rate of 125 per annum the notes may be converted into our common stock under certain circumstances based on an initial conversion rate of 158687 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which is equal to a conversion price of approximately 6302 per share of our common stock the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest concurrently with the issuance of the notes we purchased convertible note hedges for 1811 million and sold warrants for 1338 million the separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the notes 

in june 2012 with the acquisition of novellus we assumed 700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2625 convertible senior notes due may 2041 the “2041 notes” the 2041 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2625 per annum the 2041 notes may be converted under certain circumstances into our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 284781 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately 3511 per share of common stock 

during fiscal year 2013 2012 and 2011 we made 22 million 53 million and 45 million respectively in principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases respectively 

other guarantees 

we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications as of june 30 2013 we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees 

generally we indemnify under predetermined conditions and limitations our customers for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees 

  

we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business as of june 30 2013 the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was 150 million we do not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid 

warranties 

we offer standard warranties on our systems the liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system customer and geographic region modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 30 2013 our mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “other income expense” in our consolidated statement of operations all of our other shortterm investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

  

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities 

our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and concentration risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 30 2013 were as follows 

 

 we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

longterm debt 

as of june 30 2013 we had 16 billion in principal amount of fixedrate longterm debt outstanding with a fair value of 20 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall andor our common stock price increases and decrease as interest rates rise andor our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes 

  

equity price risk 

publicly traded securities 

the values of our investments in publicly traded securities including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans are subject to market price risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 15 or 25 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of june 30 2013 were as follows 

 

 foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and eurodenominated expenses 

currently we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily on japanese yendenominated revenues and eurodenominated expenses we currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation 

to protect against the reduction in value of anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yenand eurodenominated expenses we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain nonusdollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily third party accounts receivables accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balancesthe notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 30 2013 are shown in the

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 30 2013 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

  

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control — integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2013 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part iv item 15 of this 2013 form 10k 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met

lam acquired novellus systems inc “novellus” on june 4 2012 as a result of the novellus acquisition lam has enhanced its role as a leading supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the worldwide semiconductor industry in addition lam is better positioned to serve our customer base by leveraging our technical expertise across a broader portfolio of product to address the increasingly complex business of manufacturing integrated circuits lam research has been a leading supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services for more than thirty years by contributing to the advancement of semiconductor manufacturing processes that have led to the proliferation of a variety of electronic products that impact our everyday lives including cell phones computers memory and networking equipment the company’s customer base includes leading semiconductor memory foundry and integrated device manufacturers “idms” that make integrated circuits for these products such as dram nand and logic devices 

we design manufacture market refurbish and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits our products are used by every major semiconductor device manufacturer for their leading edge devices today foundry customers are manufacturing leading edge devices at the 28nm technology node 

we leverage our expertise in semiconductor device processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates enhanced yields faster processing time andor reduced cost many of the technical advances that we introduce in our newest products are also available as upgrades to our installed base of equipment this is a benefit that can provide customers with a costeffective strategy for extending the performance and capabilities of their existing wafer fabrication lines 

we are the market leader in plasma etch a highly critical process step which shapes the microscopic conductive and dielectricinsulating layers into circuits that define a chip’s final use and function in addition we offer a broad portfolio of singlewafer clean technologies which allows our customers to implement customized yieldenhancing solutions with the acquisition of novellus we have expanded into the areas of thinfilm deposition and surface preparation which like singlewafer clean are process steps often adjacent to etch during deposition alternating thinfilm conductive and dielectric layers are applied to create metal wiring and insulating structures these technologies together with other process steps enable customers to build some of the world’s highestperforming integrated circuits with each successive technology node 

  

additional requirements and challenges drive the need for advanced manufacturing solutions we strive to consistently deliver these advanced capabilities with costeffective production performance lam research understands the close relationship between customer trust and the timely delivery of new solutions that leads to shared success with our customers 

our customer support business group “csbg” provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance and operational efficiency we offer a broad range of services to deliver value throughout the lifecycle of our equipment including customer service spares upgrades refurbishment of our etch deposition photoresist strip and clean products while most semiconductor device manufacturers have transitioned to 300 mm wafer technology there are still many who utilize 200 mm technology requiring priorgeneration equipment to address this market and to meet customers’ needs for highperformance lowrisk equipment our reliant™ systems business offers a suite of new and refurbished lam legacy equipment 

with the acquisition of novellus we entered into the business of developing manufacturing selling and supporting equipment used in grinding lapping and polishing precision parts used in a broad spectrum of industrial applications our primary subsidiary in this area peter wolters is a leader in the design and manufacturing of high precision grinding lapping polishing and deburring systems used to achieve a highly precise or smooth surface on a finished material peter wolters’ products are used in the semiconductor and led manufacturing industries as well as in the automotive aerospace medical and green energy industries

etch process 

etch processes which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today our etch products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of semiconductor devices these products use various plasmabased technologies to create the desired critical device features at current and future technology nodes plasma consists of charged and neutral particles that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric or conductive materials and produce the finely defined features and patterns of an integrated circuit etch products are required to remove only the desired films and do so in a uniform fashion across the entire surface of the wafer this process is becoming increasingly challenging as device feature sizes shrink the complexity of the films being removed increases and the tolerance for variability between devices and wafers becomes smaller 

dielectric etch 

dielectric etch often requires etching multilayer film stacks smaller technology node sizes increase the complexity of the structures being etched and repeatable onwafer performance remains critical in addition to the challenges introduced by new materials and scaling device manufacturers’ focus on reducing overall cost per wafer has placed an increased emphasis on the ability to etch multiple films in the same chamber in situ  

productionproven in highvolume manufacturing for the more than 15 years our patented dual frequency confined™ “dfc” technology has been extended to incorporate multifrequency power with physically confined plasma the application of power at different frequencies provides enhanced process flexibility and allows different materials to be etched in the same chamber physical confinement of the plasma to an area directly above the wafer minimizes chemical interaction with the chamber walls eliminating potential polymer buildup that could lead to defects on the wafer confinement also enables our proprietary in situ waferless autoclean™ “wac” technology to clean chamber components after each wafer has been etched used together multifrequency and wac technologies provide a consistent process environment for every wafer preventing process drift and ensuring repeatable process results wafertowafer and chambertochamber 

2300 flex product family

conductor etch 

as the semiconductor industry continues to shrink critical feature sizes and improve device performance a variety of new etch challenges have emerged for conductor etch these challenges include processing smaller features new materials and 3dimensional transistor structures on the wafer due to decreasing feature sizes the etch process can now require atomiclevel control across a 300 mm wafer the incorporation of new metal gates and highk dielectric materials in the device stack requires advanced multifilm etching capability furthermore the adoption of double patterning techniques to address lithography challenges which began at sub40nm technology nodes expands etch processing by defining the feature on the wafer and also transferring the pattern into the film all of these challenges require today’s conductor etch systems to provide advanced capabilities while still providing high productivity 

  

introduced in 1992 our transformer coupled plasma™ “tcp” technology continues to provide leadingedge capability for advanced conductor etch applications at leading edge technology nodes by efficiently coupling radio frequency “rf” power into plasma at low pressures the tcp technology provides capability to etch nanoscale features into silicon and metal films the advanced tcp source design ensures a uniform highdensity plasma across the wafer without requiring magnetic enhancements that could cause device damage with a wide process window over a range of power chemistry and pressure combinations tcp technology provides the flexibility required to perform multiple etch steps in the same chamber

clean process 

the manufacture of semiconductor devices involves a series of processes such as etch deposition and implantation which leave particles and residues on the surface of the wafer the wafer must generally be cleaned after these steps to remove particles and residues that could adversely impact the processes that immediately follow them and degrade device performance common wafer cleaning steps include postetch and poststrip cleans and prediffusion and predeposition cleans among others 

as customers transition to smaller geometries it becomes increasingly more challenging to efficiently remove particles and residues while at the same time minimizing substrate material loss protecting structures with fragile new materials and smaller feature sizes and efficient drying similarly as manufacturers transition to smaller technology nodes managing particle buildup on the backside of the wafer surface is becoming more critical singlewafer wet processing provides an advantage over batch cleaning by preventing particles from migrating from the backside of a wafer to the frontside during the cleaning steps in addition management of potential defect sources at the wafer edge becomes increasingly challenging as new materials are introduced in the process flow 

singlewafer wet clean 

as device geometries shrink and new materials are introduced device flows become more complex and the number of wafer cleaning steps increases the need to have better control of the cleaning process to increase overall clean efficiency and to clean fragile structures without causing damage are reasons why chipmakers are turning to singlewafer wet clean processing technology for nextgeneration devices 

singlewafer wet processing is particularly advantageous for those applications where improved defect performance removing particles without damaging the wafer pattern or enhanced selectivity and cd control can improve yield over the past decade the transition from batch to singlewafer processing has occurred for backendofline wet clean applications more recently device manufacturers have transitioned to singlewafer processing for frontendofline wet clean applications as the need for higher particle removal efficiency without device structure damage has increased

fiscal periods presented 

all references to fiscal years apply to our fiscal years which ended june 24 2012 june 26 2011 and june 27 2010 in all sections of this document the fiscal 2012 information presented reflects 20 days of novellus related activity 

research and development 

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to achieve and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to rd programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 were 4446 million 3733 million and 3209 million respectively the majority of rd spending over the past three years has been targeted at etch and other plasmabased technologies singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing products we believe current challenges for customers at various points in the semiconductor manufacturing process present opportunities for us 

  

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs support our growth strategy and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service 

our marketing sales and service efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet their needs these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions for their wafer processing needs we maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of service engineers in place throughout the united states europe taiwan korea japan and asia pacific we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace 

we provide standard warranties for our systems the warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to agreedupon specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired 

international sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls compliance with us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions and economic and political conditions any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows revenue by region was as follows 

 

 customers 

our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities in fiscal year 2012 three customers samsung electronics company ltd sk hynix inc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd combined represented approximately 50 of total revenues and each customer individually represented greater than 10 of total revenues in fiscal year 2011 samsung electronics company ltd represented approximately 24 of total revenues in fiscal year 2010 three customers samsung electronics company ltd taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and toshiba corporation combined represented approximately 50 of total revenues and each customer individually represented greater than 10 of total revenues 

a material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months in order for spares and services to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and 2 delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not to exceed 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes at june 24 2012 and june 26 2011 our backlog was approximately 870 million and 641 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our 

  

customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 14 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 14 2012 we had approximately 6600 regular employees although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements and similar factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of thirdparty spare parts provider competition 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc our primary competitors in the singlewafer wet clean market are dainippon screen manufacturing co ltd and tokyo electron ltd in the tungsten cvd pecvd hdpcvd ecd and pvd markets our primary competitor is applied materials inc in the pecvd market we also compete against asm international our primary competitors in the surface preparation product arena are mattson technologies inc and psk inc 

certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do in addition we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future 

  

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed in them our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they alone will not determine our success our success depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this 2012 form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the semiconductor equipment industry is subject to major fluctuations and as a result we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems procedures for training and managing our work force and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns global economic and business conditions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development “rd” and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

our longterm success results of operations and the value of our common stock depend on our ability to successfully combine the novellus business with our preexisting business which may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected 

on june 4 2012 we acquired novellus and we are currently combining novellus’ business with our preexisting business our future success results of operations and the value of our common stock depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition to realize these anticipated benefits we must successfully combine our businesses in an efficient and effective manner and communicate the impact that a business combination will have on our financial statements if we are not able to achieve and clearly communicate these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer than expected to realize and our results of operations and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected 

specific issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of novellus into our preexisting operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized actual synergies if achieved at all may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we are not able to adequately address these challenges we may be unable to successfully integrate the combined company’s operations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

as a result of the sale of our 2016 and 2018 convertible notes and the assumption of the 2041 convertible notes in connection with the novellus acquisition collectively the “notes” we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

conversion of our notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our shareholders this dilution may be mitigated to some extent by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the 2016 and 2018 notes prior to the maturity of the notes if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price us gaap requires that we report an increase in diluted share count which would result in lower reported earnings per share the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes 

we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of highpriced systems 

system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems are priced up to approximately 6 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a limited number of systems as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in increased costs andor lower margins for us similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results as of june 24 2012 three customers accounted for approximately 24 17 and 11  of accounts receivable as of june 26 2011 three customers accounted for approximately 17 14 and 10 of accounts receivable 

variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which may vary from customer to customer and tool to tool such variations could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

  

we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability quality or design problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace the expected industry transition to a 450mm platform represents an emerging challenge for our business our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both moreover customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices this shift may result in a reduction in the size of lam’s addressable markets for example the adoption of extreme ultraviolet lithography may adversely impact lam’s served available market 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products which we expect will continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of these products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products as well this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer steps using our products this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances and potential customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies andor achieve economies of scale the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function andor the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale andor increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes while in certain instances this could work to our advantage if our equipment becomes the basis for the function or process as the tool of choice for the larger consolidated customer or alliance it could also work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes 

similarly our customers may team with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

  

we depend on a limited number of key suppliers 

we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we have established longterm contracts with many of these suppliers these longterm contracts can take a variety of forms we may renew these contracts periodically in some cases these suppliers have sold us products for a substantial period of time and we expect that we and they will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers however certain of our suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited where practical we intend to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships 

our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 

outsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization although we attempt to select reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business 

in addition the expansive role of our outsource providers has required and may continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer andor employee relationships which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors especially those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 83 of total revenue in fiscal year 2012 88 of total revenue in fiscal year 2011 and 91 of total revenue in fiscal year 2010 we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china taiwan japan south korea and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions this would adversely affect our business with china taiwan japan andor south korea and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain of our revenues denominated in japanese yen and euros as well as certain of our spares and service contracts euro denominated expenses and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices that are denominated in the related countries’ local currency 

we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated “jpy” revenue and monetary assets and liabilities eurodenominated “eur” expenses and monetary assets and liabilities as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in swiss francs “chf”taiwanese dollars “twd” and great british pounds “gbp” we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either overor underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated “usd” assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures therefore we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions for these currencies 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsource providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment confidential information stored on these information systems could be compromised to the extent that these information systems are under our control we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to mitigate the outlined risks however security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time or unauthorized releases of confidential information could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required 

  

to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws by material audit assessments or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing the need for all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital make acquisitions or subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

  

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam research from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and suppliers with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications additionally even when patents are issued the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business

 repurchase of company shares 

on september 10 2010 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250 million of our common stock and on september 1 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of our common stock on december 14 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 16 billion of our common stock in conjunction with the acquisition of novellus which replaces the previous repurchase authorizations these repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law repurchases will be funded using our available cash this repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

as part of our share repurchase program we may from timetotime enter into structured share repurchase arrangements with financial institutions using general corporate funds during fiscal year 2012 such arrangements included the following 

cash enhanced share repurchases 

under cash enhanced share repurchases we are required to make an upfront cash payment in exchange for the right to receive shares of our common stock or cash at the expiration of the agreement dependent upon the closing price of our common stock at the settlement date during the year ended june 24 2012 one such arrangement resulted in the receipt of 26 million shares upon settlement at an aggregate price of 1000 million and two such arrangements were settled in cash for an aggregate of 1302 million all cash enhanced share repurchase agreements during fiscal year 2012 were executed prior to the december 2011 16 billion buyback authorization as of june 24 2012 there are no outstanding prepayments under such arrangements under these arrangements any prepayments or cash payments at settlement are recorded as a component of additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet 

collared accelerated share repurchases 

during the year ended june 24 2012 we entered into two share repurchase transactions under one master repurchase arrangement under these collared accelerated share repurchase transactions “asrs” we made upfront cash payments of 375 million and 200 million respectively three days after the respective trade date in exchange for an initial delivery of 66 million and 39 million shares of our common stock respectively the number of shares to ultimately be repurchased by us is based generally on the volumeweighted average price “vwap” of our common stock during the term of the asr minus a predetermined fixed discount set at inception of the asr subject to collar provisions that provide a minimum and maximum number of shares that we could repurchase under the agreements 

the minimum and maximum thresholds for each transaction are established based on the average of the vwap prices for our common stock during an initial hedge period we received incremental shares on top of the initial shares delivered such that the total number of shares received under the asrs after the initial hedge period equaled 88 million and 48 million shares representing the minimum number of shares to be delivered under the terms of the asrs respectively the asrs were scheduled to end on or before september 18 2012 and october 9 2012 respectively however each asr is subject to acceleration at the option of the counterparty at any time after june 27 2012 and july 19 2012 respectively at the conclusion of the asrs we may receive additional shares based on the vwap of our common stock during the term of the agreement minus the predetermined fixed discount such that the total number of shares received under the asrs does not exceed the maximum of 108 and 66 million shares respectively 

  

we accounted for each asr as two separate transactions a as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date and b as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity as such we accounted for the shares that we received under the asrs as a repurchase of our common stock for the purpose of calculating earnings per common share we have determined that the forward contracts indexed to our common stock met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification in accordance with the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb asc and therefore the asrs were not accounted for as derivative instruments as of june 24 2012 the aggregate repurchase price of 5750 million is reflected as treasury stock at cost in our condensed consolidated balance sheet 

the counterparty designated july 6 2012 as the accelerated termination date at which time we settled the 375 million asr and received an additional 13 million shares of common stock in addition to the minimum shares already received which represented a weighted average share price of approximately 3680 for the transaction period the counterparty designated july 25 2012 as the accelerated termination date at which time we settled the 200 million asr and received an additional 07 million shares of common stock in addition to the minimum shares already received which represented a weighted average share price of approximately 3612 for the transaction period 

share repurchases including those under the repurchase program were as follows

executive summary 

we design manufacture market refurbish and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make dram flash memory microprocessors and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of consumer and industrial electronics semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits we leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates enhanced yields faster processing time and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic and pronounced changes in customer demand resulting in industry downturns and upturns today’s leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns such as electronics demand memory pricing and foundry utilization rates may not be any more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries supply demand prices for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop acquire and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations during any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

demand for our products declined in fiscal year 2012 as semiconductor device manufacturers slowed the pace of their capacity expansions in response to weaker macroeconomic conditions impacting demand for certain semiconductor devices in spite of the slowing pace of capacity expansion particularly in the memory segment our customers continued to invest in leading edge technologies over this period we believe that over the long term demand for our products will increase as customers’ capital expenditures rise to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices particularly in mobile markets and address the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing 

the following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below 

 

 on june 4 2012 we completed our acquisition of novellus systems inc “novellus” results for fiscal year 2012 include novellus operations from the acquisition date through june 24 2012 lam’s primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue and cost synergies 

fiscal year 2012 revenues decreased 18 compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily reflecting the decrease in customer capacity investments as noted above the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume and less favorable customer and product mix operating expenses in fiscal year 2012 increased as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily related to continued investments in nextgeneration research and development and the customer facing activities that surround and support it and costs associated with the novellus acquisition and integration 

  

our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 30 billion as of june 24 2012 compared to 23 billion as of june 26 2011 this increase included the impact of 11 billion acquired in connection with the novellus acquisition offset by 773 million of share repurchases we generated approximately 499 million in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2012 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 881 million in fiscal year 2011 the decreased operating cash flows in fiscal year 2012 versus fiscal year 2011 were primarily a result of lower revenue increased investments in research and development and costs related to the novellus acquisition 

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

 

 shipments for fiscal year 2012 were approximately 27 billion and decreased by 19 compared to fiscal year 2011 shipments for fiscal year 2011 were approximately 33 billion and increased by 43 compared to fiscal year 2010 the decrease in shipments during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 related to change in demand for semiconductor equipment especially in the first half of fiscal year 2012 the increase in shipments from fiscal year 2010 to 2011 reflects improvements in the industry and economic environments 

during fiscal year 2012 applications at or below the 45 nanometer technology node were 93 of total systems shipments during fiscal year 2011 applications at or below the 65 nanometer technology node were 90 of total systems shipments during fiscal year 2012 the memory market segment foundry segment and logicintegrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 45 46 and 9 of system shipments respectively during fiscal year 2011 the memory market segment foundry segment and logicintegrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 49 32 and 19 of system shipments respectively starting with the december 2011 quarter we have modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business these shipments were previously reported in the logicintegrated device manufacturing category 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 24 2012 were approximately 870 million and increased from approximately 641 million as of june 26 2011 our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog

 the revenue decrease in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was due to the decrease in customer capacity investments the revenue increase during fiscal year 2011 compared to 2010 reflected improvements in the industry and economic environments our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to 

  

occur in this region our deferred revenue balance increased to 3354 million as of june 24 2012 compared to 2576 million as of june 26 2011 due to the addition of novellusrelated activity and increased customer shipment levels in the second half of fiscal year 2012 our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 23 million as of june 24 2012 compared to 70 million as of june 26 2011 

gross margin 

 

 the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume and less favorable customer and product mix 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to increased factory and field utilization as a result of higher volume 

research and development 

 

 we continued to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge plasma etch singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements the increase in rd spending during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to an 18 million increase in salary and benefits as a result of higher headcount a 21 million increase in supplies and an 11 million increase in depreciation related to new product development also included in our results are 11 million of novellusrelated rd expenses that were incurred in the june 2012 quarter from acquisition date through june 24 2012 

the increase in rd spending during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to a 27 million increase in employee compensation and benefits mainly as a result of higher headcount and stronger company profitability and a 19 million increase in outside services and supplies related to new product development 

approximately 30 of both fiscal years 2012 and 2011 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies 

selling general and administrative 

 

 the increase in sga expense during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to 63 million in expenses related to the novellus acquisition and integration and 13 million of novellus related sga expenses including 4 million of intangible asset amortization incurred in the june 2012 quarter from acquisition date through june 24 2012 

the growth in sga expense during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to a 44 million increase in employee compensation and benefits mainly as a result of higher headcount and stronger company profitability and an 18 million increase in outside services and supplies for customer penetration activities rent and depreciationrelated expenses increased in fiscal year 2011 from fiscal year 2010 by approximately 13 million the increases in sga expenses during fiscal year 2011 were offset by the release of approximately 4 million of previously reserved allowance for doubtful accounts as the result of cash collections from customers 

restructuring and asset impairments 

during fiscal year 2012 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of 09 million consisting of a 17 million expense related to a decline in the market value of certain facilities partially offset by the release of 08 million related to a recorded obligation not realized for a previously restructured product line during fiscal year 2011 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of 116 million consisting 

  

primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases during fiscal year 2010 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of 248 million consisting primarily of 198 million of facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for certain previously restructured leases and 60 million of asset impairment charges related to production efficiencies and shifts in product demands partially offset by a recovery of 22 million related to inventory previously restructured in connection with our initial product line integration road maps 

for further details related to restructuring and asset impairment see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

409a expense 

in fiscal year 2008 following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process we considered whether section 409a of the internal revenue code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates if a stock option is not considered as issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock it may be subject to penalty taxes under section 409a and similar provisions of state law in such a case taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic value increase but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times on march 30 2008 our board of directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees relating to options that might be subject to section 409a and similar provisions of state law those liabilities totaled 509 million for fiscal year 2008 and an incremental 32 million of expense during fiscal year 2009 during fiscal year 2010 we reached final settlement of matters associated with our 409a expenses with the internal revenue service “irs” and california franchise tax board “ftb” resulting in a credit of 444 million due to the reversal of 409a liabilities there were no expenses or reversals related to section 409a during fiscal year 2011 or 2012 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 

 

 the increase in interest income during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 and during fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to increases in our average cash and investment balances from cash provided by operations and proceeds from convertible note financing which was partially offset by treasury stock transactions and the decrease in interest rate yields 

the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 and during fiscal year 2011 as compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the issuance of the 900 million convertible notes during may 2011 

foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2012 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2011 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures primarily in the euro korean won and singapore dollar 

other expenses during fiscal year 2012 increased as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily due to increased charitable contributions 

income tax expense 

our annual income tax expense was 357 million 771 million and 835 million in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 was 175 96 and 194 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the level of income the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions decrease in federal rd tax credit due to the expiration of the credit on december 31 2011 increase in nondeductible stock based compensation and nondeductible acquisition costs the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the settlement of audits and tax benefit due to the extension of the second half of fiscal year 2010 federal rd tax credit 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards were 2537 million and 1606 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 2856 million and 451 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011 respectively and a valuation allowance of 552 million and 462 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011 respectively the change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2012 and 2011 is primarily as a result of our acquisition of novellus 

  

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is morelikelythannot to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed our fiscal years 2012 and 2011 valuation allowance of 552 million and 462 million relate to california and certain foreign deferred tax assets 

at our fiscal year end of june 24 2012 we continued to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election additionally we recorded valuation allowance related to tax assets established in purchase price accounting we released valuation allowance on certain foreign entities’ deferred tax assets due to an increase in the forecasted income and indefinite net operating loss carryforward period in those jurisdictions 

we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have received customer acceptance completed our system installation obligations or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations we allocate revenue from multipleelement arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices provided the elements have value on a standalone basis our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return the maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straightline basis over the term of the contract when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met we record deferred revenue andor deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet 

inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale unless specified in the terms of sale title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance 

we reassess standard costs as needed but annually at a minimum and reflect achievable acquisition costs acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels methods of manufacturing and normalized overhead manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes we eliminate all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities from our consolidated financial statements 

  

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we provide standard warranties for our systems when appropriate we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability trends all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a systembysystem basis 

actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded as incurred 

equitybased compensation — employee stock purchase plan “espp” and employee stock plans gaap requires us to recognize the fair value of equitybased compensation in net income we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units “rsus” based upon the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using the blackscholes option valuation model this model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award we amortize the fair value of equitybased awards over the vesting periods of the awards and we have elected to use the straightline method of amortization 

we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equitybased compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations we will only recognize a benefit from stockbased compensation in paidincapital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized in addition we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stockbased compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement continuing operations rather than through paidincapital we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paidincapital 

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is morelikelythannot that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made 

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we allocate the carrying value of goodwill to our reporting units we test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 

  

we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we are required to assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined beginning with our fiscal year 2012 goodwill impairment analysis we adopted new accounting guidance that allowed us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform a quantitative analysis under the revised guidance an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 

under the market approach we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units we also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or our failure to reach our internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value in addition the value we assign to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new authoritative guidance that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income “oci” by eliminating the option to present components of oci as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity the amendments in this standard require that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance does not affect the underlying accounting for components of oci but will change the presentation of our financial statements we will adopt this authoritative guidance retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2013 

in september 2011 the fasb issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment the amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that its fair value is less than its carrying amount we adopted this guidance during fiscal year 2012 and it did not have a significant impact on the results of our annual goodwill impairment assessment 

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 30 billion at the end of fiscal year 2012 compared to 23 billion at the end of fiscal year 2011 this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations and cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of novellus which was offset by 773 million of share repurchases 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 499 million during fiscal year 2012 consisted of in millions 

 

 significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts net of foreign exchange impact included the following sources of cash decreases in inventories of 740 million accounts receivable of 661 million and prepaid and other assets of 432 million and an increase in accounts payable of 121 million partially offset by the following uses of cash decreases in accrued liabilities of 1200 million and deferred profit of 92 million 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2012 was 2697 million which was primarily due to 4187 million cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of novellus partially offset by capital expenditures of 1073 million and net purchases of availableforsale securities and other investment of 527 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2012 was 6927 million which was primarily due to 7727 million in treasury stock repurchases partially offset by 552 million net cash settlements under structured stock repurchase arrangement see note 20 of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements and net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee equitybased plans of 273 million 

liquidity 

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based upon our current business outlook we expect that our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 24 2012 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances in the united states and offshore we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap and include our longterm debt which is outlined in the following table and noted below our offbalance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 24 2012 relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table the amounts in the table below exclude 2742 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement see note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

   

operating leases 

we lease most of our administrative rd and manufacturing facilities regional salesservice offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont california headquarters livermore facilities and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation in addition to amounts included in the table above we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our fremont and livermore facility leases of up to 1649 million see note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

capital leases 

capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations the amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multiyear periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments including vendorconsigned inventories we continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities including elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities maintenance certain information technology functions and certain transactional general and administrative functions the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 24 2012 under these arrangements and others for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition to these obligations certain of these agreements include early termination provisions andor cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid 

longterm debt 

on may 11 2011 we issued and sold 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of 05 convertible notes due 2016 the “2016 notes” and 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible notes due 2018 the “2018 notes” and collectively with the “2016 notes” the “notes” the 2016 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 05 per annum and the 2018 notes were issued at par and pay interest at rate of 125 per annum the notes may be converted into our common stock under certain circumstances based on an initial conversion rate of 158687 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which is equal to a conversion price of approximately 6302 per share of our common stock the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest concurrently with the issuance of the notes we purchased convertible note hedges for 1811 million and sold warrants for 1338 million the separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the notes 

in june 2012 with the acquisition of novellus we assumed 700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2625 convertible senior notes due may 2041 the “2041 notes” the 2041 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2625 per annum the 2041 notes may be converted under certain circumstances into our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 284781 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately 3511 per share of common stock 

during fiscal year 2012 2011 and 2010 we made 53 million 45 million and 210 million respectively in principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases respectively 

other guarantees 

we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications as of june 24 2012 we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees 

generally we indemnify under predetermined conditions and limitations our customers for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees 

we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business as of june 24 2012 the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was 199 million we do not believe based on historical experience and information currently available that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid 

warranties 

we offer standard warranties on our systems the liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system customer and geographic region modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements 

  

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 24 2012 our mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “other income expense” in our consolidated statement of operations all of our other shortterm investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities 

our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 24 2012 were as follows 

 

 we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

longterm debt 

as of june 24 2012 we had 16 billion in principal amount of fixedrate longterm debt outstanding with a fair value of 17 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall andor our common stock price increases and decrease as interest rates rise andor our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes

foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars except for certain revenues denominated in japanese yen certain revenues and expenses denominated in the euro certain spares and service contracts denominated in various currencies and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices denominated in the related countries’ local currency we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated revenue and monetary asset and liability exposure eurodenominated expenses and monetary assets and liabilities as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in swiss francs taiwanese dollars and great british pounds we currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation 

to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue and eurodenominated expenses we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of japanese yen euros swiss franc taiwanese dollar and great british pound denominated monetary assets and liabilities against the us dollar the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 

the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 24 2012 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent 

 

 the notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges as of june 24 2012 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent these changes in fair values would be offset in other income expense net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 24 2012 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control — integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 24 2012 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

in accordance with guidance issued by the sec companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of novellus the acquired business represented approximately 1 percent of consolidated revenues for the year ended june 24 2012 and approximately 25 percent of consolidated total assets and approximately 23 percent of consolidated net assets excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments as of june 24 2012 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part iv item 15 of this 2012 form 10k 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met

etch process 

etch processes which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today our etch products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of semiconductor devices these products use various plasmabased technologies to create the desired critical device features at current and future technology nodes plasma consists of charged and neutral particles that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric or conductive materials and produce the finely defined features and patterns of an integrated circuit etch products are required to remove only the desired films and do so in a uniform fashion across the entire surface of the wafer this process is becoming increasingly challenging as device feature sizes shrink the complexity of the films being removed increases and the tolerance for variability between devices and wafers becomes smaller 

dielectric etch 

dielectric etch often requires etching multilayer film stacks smaller technology node sizes increase the complexity of the structures being etched and repeatable onwafer performance remains critical in addition to the challenges introduced by new materials and scaling device manufacturers’ focus on reducing overall cost per wafer has placed an increased emphasis on the ability to etch multiple films in the same chamber in situ  

dfc technology 

productionproven in highvolume manufacturing for the more than 15 years our patented dual frequency confined™ technology has been extended to incorporate multifrequency power with physically confined plasma the application of power at different frequencies provides enhanced process flexibility and allows different materials to be etched in the same chamber physical confinement of the plasma to an area directly above the wafer minimizes chemical interaction with the chamber walls eliminating potential polymer buildup that could lead to defects on the wafer confinement also enables our proprietary in situ waferless autoclean™ “wac” technology to clean chamber components after each wafer has been etched used together multifrequency and wac technologies provide a consistent process environment for every wafer preventing process drift and ensuring repeatable process results wafertowafer and chambertochamber

conductor etch 

as the semiconductor industry continues to shrink critical feature sizes and improve device performance a variety of new etch challenges have emerged for conductor etch these challenges include processing smaller features new materials and new 3dimensional transistor structures on the wafer due to decreasing feature sizes the etch process can now require atomiclevel control across a 300 mm wafer the incorporation of new metal gates and highk dielectric materials in the device stack requires advanced multifilm etching capability furthermore the adoption of double patterning techniques to address lithography challenges starting with the 3x technology node and beyond is driving the etch process to define the feature on the wafer as well as to transfer the pattern into the film all of these challenges require today’s conductor etch systems to provide advanced capabilities while still providing high productivity 

tcp technology 

introduced in 1992 our transformer coupled plasma ™ “tcp” technology continues to provide leadingedge capability for advanced conductor etch applications at the 32 nm node and beyond by efficiently coupling radio frequency “rf” power into plasma at low pressures the tcp technology provides capability to etch nanoscale features into silicon and metal films the advanced tcp source design ensures a uniform highdensity plasma across the wafer without requiring magnetic enhancements that could cause device damage with a wide process window over a range of power chemistry and pressure combinations tcp technology provides the flexibility required to perform multiple etch steps in the same chamber

threedimensional integrated circuit etch 

the semiconductor industry is developing advanced threedimensional integrated circuits “3dics” using throughsilicon vias “tsvs” to provide interconnect capability for dietodie and wafertowafer stacking in addition to a reduced form factor 3d ics can enhance device performance through increased speed and decreased power consumption manufacturers are currently considering a wide variety of 3d integration schemes that present an equally broad range of tsv etch requirements plasma etch technology which has been used extensively for deep silicon etching in memory devices and microelectromechanical systems “mems” production is well suited for tsv creation 

2300 ® syndion ® throughsilicon via etch system 

the 2300 syndion etch system is based on our patented tcp technology and the productionproven 2300 versys kiyo conductor etch system the syndion system can etch multiple film stacks in the same chamber including silicon dielectric and conducting materials thereby addressing multiple tsv etch requirements 

  

mems and deep silicon etch 

deep silicon etch is an enabling process for several emerging technologies including mems devices cmos image sensors and power devices many of these technologies are increasingly being used in consumer applications such as ink jet printer heads accelerometers and inertial sensors this is driving a number of deep silicon etch applications to transition into highvolume manufacturing which requires the high levels of costeffective production typically seen in commodity semiconductor memory devices to achieve high yield in mass production the deep silicon etch process requires wafertowafer repeatability 

tcp ® 9400dsie ™ deep silicon etch system 

the tcp 9400dsie system is based on our productionproven tcp 9400 silicon etch series the system’s patented highdensity tcp plasma source provides a configuration to meet the challenges of silicon deep reactive ion etch this offers broad process capability and flexibility for a wide range of mems advanced packaging power semiconductor applications and tsv applications on 150 mm and 200 mm wafers in addition incorporation of our proprietary in situ chamber cleaning technology provides etch rate stability 

clean process 

the manufacture of semiconductor devices involves a series of processes such as etch deposition and implantation which leave particles and residues on the surface of the wafer the wafer must generally be cleaned after these steps to remove particles and residues that could adversely impact the processes that immediately follow them and degrade device performance common wafer cleaning steps include postetch and poststrip cleans and prediffusion and predeposition cleans among others 

as device manufacturers transition to the 32 nm and 28 nm technology nodes it becomes increasingly more challenging to efficiently remove particles and residues while at the same time minimizing substrate material loss protecting structures with fragile new materials and smaller feature sizes and efficient drying similarly as manufacturers transition to smaller technology nodes managing particle buildup on the backside of the wafer surface is becoming more critical singlewafer wet processing provides an advantage over batch cleaning by preventing particles from migrating from the backside of a wafer to the frontside during the cleaning steps in addition management of potential defect sources at the wafer edge becomes increasingly challenging as new materials are introduced in the process flow 

singlewafer wet clean 

as device geometries shrink and new materials are introduced device flows become more complex and the number of wafer cleaning steps increases the need to have better control of the cleaning process to increase overall clean efficiency and to clean fragile structures without causing damage are reasons why chipmakers are turning to singlewafer wet clean processing technology for nextgeneration devices 

over the past decade a transition from batch to singlewafer processing has occurred for backendofline wet clean applications more recently the migration for frontendofline wet clean applications has started to accelerate as the need for higher particle removal efficiency without device structure damage becomes more critical singlewafer wet processing is particularly advantageous for those applications where improved defect performance removing particles without damaging the wafer pattern or enhanced selectivity and cd control can improve yield 

spin clean products sp series da vinci ®  dvprime ® 

introduced over 20 years ago our spin technology for cleaning and removing films has assisted the industry transition from batch to singlewafer wet processing this proven technology provides the productivity and flexibility needed for both highvolume manufacturing and leadingedge development across multiple technology nodes and for all device types by offering advanced dilute chemistry and solvent solutions in our systems our spin wet clean systems address certain defectivity and material integrity requirements in addition our unique wafer chuck design provides the ability to effectively clean the backside of the wafer without damaging the devices on the frontside of the wafer surface

plasmabased bevel clean 

semiconductor manufacturers are paying increasing attention to the wafer edge as a source of yield limiting defects new materials like porous lowk and organic films often do not adhere as well as traditional silicon or polymerbased films and have the potential to be significant defect sources by including cleaning steps that target the bevel region the number of good die at the wafer’s edge can be increased to maximize yield 

2300 ® coronus ® plasma bevel clean system 

the 2300 coronus plasma bevel clean system incorporates plasma technology to remove yield limiting defect sources the system combines the ability of plasma to selectively remove a wide variety of materials with a proprietary confinement technology that protects the die area incorporating our dynamic alignment technology on the productionproven 2300 platform the coronus system provides highly accurate wafer placement for repeatable process results and superior encroachment control and is designed to remove a wide range of material types in multiple applications throughout the manufacturing process flow 

research and development 

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to achieve and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to rd programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 were 3733 million 3209 million and 2883 million respectively the majority of rd spending over the past three years has been targeted at etch and other plasmabased technologies singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing products we believe current challenges for customers at various points in the semiconductor manufacturing process present opportunities for us 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs support our growth strategy and enhance our competitive position

we provide standard warranties for our systems the warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to agreedupon specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides 

  

prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired 

international sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls compliance with us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions and economic and political conditions any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows revenue by region was as follows 

 

 customers 

our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities in fiscal year 2011 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd accounted for approximately 24 of total revenues in fiscal year 2010 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and toshiba corporation accounted for approximately 24 15 and 11 respectively of total revenues in fiscal year 2009 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd and toshiba corporation accounted for approximately 19 and 11 respectively of total revenues 

a material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 we have received a written customer request that has been accepted 2 we have an agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months the spares and services backlog includes customer orders where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not exceeding 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes at june 26 2011 and june 27 2010 our backlog was approximately 641 million and 667 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation 

  

by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 14 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 12 2011 we had approximately 3700 regular employees although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements etc our ability to 

  

succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of thirdparty spare parts provider competition 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc our primary competitor in the singlewafer wet clean market is dainippon screen manufacturing co ltd 

certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do in addition we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future 

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed in them our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they alone will not determine our success our success depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this 2011 form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the semiconductor equipment industry is subject to major fluctuations and as a result we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems procedures for training and managing our work force and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure work force and other components of our business on a timely basis if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted in late 2008 and throughout 2009 the semiconductor industry experienced a general decline in demand leading to a steep decline in demand for our products and services in response to that industry demand decline and in an effort to minimize the disruptive effects of the deteriorating economic conditions on our business operating results we made difficult resource allocation decisions including layoffs and restructurings 

we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during this period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future declines in the semiconductor industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns global economic and business conditions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic 

  

uncertainty some of our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development “rd” and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

as a result of the sale of our convertible notes “notes” we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt as a result we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available obtain it on acceptable terms if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

conversion of our notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock which would result in dilution to our shareholders this dilution may be mitigated to some extent by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the notes prior to the maturity of the notes if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price us gaap requires that we report an increase in diluted share count which would result in lower reported earnings per share the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes 

we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of highpriced systems 

system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems are priced up to approximately 6 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a limited number of systems as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue shipments and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict in addition large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in 

  

increased costs andor lower margins for us similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results as of june 26 2011 three customers accounted for approximately 17 14 and 10  of accounts receivable as of june 27 2010 two customers accounted for approximately 24 and 22  of accounts receivable 

variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which may vary from customer to customer and tool to tool such variations could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability quality or design problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace our failure to commercialize these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products moreover future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products and we expect our etch and clean products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of these products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products as well this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes since we are a provider of etch and clean equipment 

  

our business is affected by our customers’ use of etching and clean steps in their processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching or clean steps this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies often one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while this could work to our advantage if our equipment becomes the basis for the function or process it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process in the latter case even if our equipment was previously used by a customer that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance 

similarly our customers may team with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

we are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers 

we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we have established longterm contracts with many of these suppliers these longterm contracts can take a variety of forms we may renew these contracts periodically in some cases these suppliers have sold us products for a substantial period of time and we expect that we and they will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers however certain of our suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited where practical we intend to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage to our customer relationships 

our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 

outsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization although we attempt to select reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business 

in addition the expansive role of our outsource providers has required and may continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer andor employee relationships which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application 

  

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors especially those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 88 of total revenue in fiscal year 2011 91 of total revenue in fiscal year 2010 and 85 of total revenue in fiscal year 2009 we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the 

  

business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships among china taiwan japan south korea and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions this would adversely affect our business with china taiwan japan andor south korea and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain of our revenues denominated in japanese yen and euros as well as certain of our spares and service contracts euro denominated expenses and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices that are denominated in the related countries’ local currency 

we currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated “jpy” revenue and monetary assets and liabilities eurodenominated “eur” expenses and monetary assets and liabilities as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in swiss francs “chf” and taiwanese dollars “twd” we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined for the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated “usd” assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these other foreign currency exposures therefore we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in other currencies 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsource providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment confidential information stored on these information systems could be compromised to the extent that these information systems are under our control we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to mitigate the outlined risks however security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time or unauthorized releases of confidential information could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

  

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws or by material audit assessments these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the handling discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing the need for all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure to comply with regulations governing the use handling sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital make acquisitions or subject our business to additional costs 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam research in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties moreover although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses or at all and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications additionally even when patents are issued the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states the rights granted or anticipated 

  

under any of our patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic and pronounced changes in customer demand resulting in industry downturns and upturns today’s leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns such as electronics demand memory pricing and foundry utilization rates may not be any more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries supply demand prices for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop acquire and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations during any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

we believe that over the long term demand for our products will increase as customers’ capital expenditures rise to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices we believe that the wafer fabrication equipment market in calendar year 2011 will be similar in size to calendar year 2010 dependent on among other things worldwide gdp growth consumer adoption rates for new products such as tablet devices and highend smart phones and our customers’ transition to more advanced technology nodes however historically any improvement in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment occurs at an uneven pace accordingly any forecasts about demand for wafer fabrication equipment in the near term are subject to uncertainty and we could experience significant volatility in our quarterly results of operations over the next several quarters 

  

the following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below 

 

 fiscal year 2011 results compared with fiscal year 2010 reflect continued improvement in the global business environment and in the semiconductor industry improved foundry fabrication utilization and an increase in the rate of nextgeneration dram and nand technology conversions by leading memory companies 

fiscal year 2011 revenues increased 52 compared to fiscal year 2010 primarily reflecting increased system shipments driven by growth in customer demand the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to increased revenue along with increased factory and field utilization resulting from higher overall volume 

operating expenses in fiscal year 2011 increased as compared to fiscal year 2010 this change was primarily due to increased research and development activities and enhanced levels of sales and marketing expense associated with customer projects and a credit in fiscal year 2010 of approximately 39 million related to the reversal of accrued liabilities due to the final settlement of matters associated with our internal revenue code section 409a expenses from the 2007 voluntary independent stock option review 

our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 23 billion as of june 26 2011 compared to 992 million as of june 27 2010 we generated approximately 881 million in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2011 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 351 million in fiscal year 2010 the increased operating cash flows in fiscal year 2011 versus fiscal year 2010 were mainly generated from higher revenue volumes during the fiscal year additionally during fiscal year 2011 the company completed a convertible note financing and generated 836 million in net cash which includes proceeds from warrant sales offset by issuance fees and purchase of convertible note hedges 

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

 

 shipments for fiscal year 2011 were approximately 33 billion and increased by 43 compared to fiscal year 2010 shipments for fiscal year 2010 increased sequentially from fiscal year 2009 by 136 the sequential growth for both fiscal years reflects improvements in the industry and economic environments as noted above 

  

during fiscal year 2011 applications at or below the 65 nanometer technology node were 90 of total systems shipments during fiscal year 2010 applications at or below the 65 nanometer technology node were 96 of total systems shipments during fiscal year 2011 the memory market segment foundry segment and logicintegrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 49 32 and 19 of system shipments respectively during fiscal year 2010 the memory market segment foundry segment and logicintegrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 61 29 and 10 of system shipments respectively in fiscal year 2011 we saw a broadening of customers some of which added capacity above the 65 nanometer node 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 26 2011 were approximately 641 million and decreased from approximately 667 million as of june 27 2010 our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog 

revenue 

 

 the revenue increase during fiscal year 2011 compared to 2010 and fiscal year 2010 compared to 2009 reflected improvements in the industry and economic environments as noted above our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region our deferred revenue balance increased to 2576 million as of june 26 2011 compared to 2074 million as of june 27 2010 consistent with increased customer spending levels during fiscal year 2011 our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 70 million as of june 26 2011 compared to 52 million as of june 27 2010 

gross margin 

 

 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to increased factory and field utilization as a result of higher volume 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to improved product mix and more favorable absorption from the factories additionally there was a decrease in restructuring and asset impairments included in gross margin from approximately 21 million in fiscal year 2009 to 3 million in fiscal year 2010 and a credit in fiscal year 2010 of approximately 6 million related to a reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of matters associated with our internal revenue code section 409a expenses from the 2007 voluntary independent stock option review 

  

research and development 

 

 we continue to make significant rd investments focused on leadingedge plasma etch singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements the increase in rd spending during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to higher employee compensation and benefits of 27 million mainly as a result of increased headcount and stronger company profitability and higher outside services and supplies of 19 million related to new product development 

the increase in rd spending during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to higher employee compensation and benefits of 25 million mainly as a result of stronger company profitability and higher outside services and supplies of 5 million 

approximately 30 and 24 of fiscal years 2011 and 2010 systems revenues respectively were derived from products introduced over the previous two years which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies 

selling general and administrative 

 

 the growth in sga expense during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to higher employee compensation and benefits of 44 million mainly as a result of increased headcount and stronger company profitability and higher outside services and supplies of 18 million for customer penetration activities rent and depreciationrelated expenses increased in fiscal year 2011 from fiscal year 2010 by approximately 13 million the increases in sga expenses during fiscal year 2011 were offset by the release of approximately 4 million of previously reserved allowance for doubtful accounts as the result of cash collections from customers 

the growth in sga expense during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was driven by increases of approximately 26 million in employee compensation as a result of increased company profitability offset by a 9 million decline in depreciation rent and utilities expenses primarily as a result of restructuring activities and 7 million due to a nonrecurring accounts receivable reserve recorded for specific distressed customers in fiscal year 2009 

goodwill impairment 

during fiscal year 2009 a combination of factors including the economic environment a sustained decline in our market valuation and a decline in our operating results indicated possible impairment of our goodwill we performed an impairment analysis and concluded that the fair value of our clean product group had been reduced below its carrying value as a result we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of approximately 963 million during fiscal year 2009 we concluded that there were no indicators of impairment as a result of our fiscal 2010 and 2011 assessments 

the calculation of the goodwill impairment charge is based on estimates of future operating results if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our businesses an additional impairment analysis may be required which may result in further impairment charges 

  

restructuring and asset impairments 

during fiscal year 2008 we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges of 190 million related to the integration of sez and overall streamlining of our combined clean product group “june 2008 plan” we incurred additional expenses of 190 million under the june 2008 plan during fiscal year 2009 the charges during fiscal year 2008 and 2009 primarily included severance and related benefits costs and certain asset impairments associated with our product line integration road maps during fiscal year 2010 we recorded a recovery of 22 million related primarily to inventory previously restructured in connection with our initial product line integration road maps 

during fiscal year 2009 we incurred expenses of 178 million for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to better align our cost structure with our business opportunities in consideration of market and economic uncertainties “december 2008 plan” the charges consisted of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments 

during fiscal year 2009 we also incurred expenses of 286 million for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to align our cost structure with our outlook for the current economic environment and future business opportunities “march 2009 plan” the charges during fiscal year 2009 consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments the company incurred additional expenses of 209 million during fiscal 2010 under the march 2009 plan consisting primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases severance and related benefits costs and asset impairments during fiscal year 2011 the company incurred additional expenses of 118 million under the march 2009 plan consisting primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases 

in addition to charges incurred under specific restructuring plans during fiscal year 2010 we incurred 60 million of asset impairment charges related to production efficiencies and shifts in product demands 

for further details related to restructuring and asset impairment see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

409a expense 

following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process we considered whether section 409a of the internal revenue code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found under applicable accounting guidance to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates if a stock option is not considered as issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock it may be subject to penalty taxes under section 409a and similar provisions of state law in such a case taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic value increase but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times on march 30 2008 our board of directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees including our chief executive officer and certain executive officers relating to options that might be subject to section 409a and similar provisions of state law those liabilities totaled 509 million 445 million was recorded in operating expenses and 64 million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year 2008 we incurred 32 million of expense during fiscal year 2009 consisting of interest and legal fees during fiscal year 2010 we reached final settlement of matters associated with our 409a expenses with the internal revenue service “irs” and california franchise tax board “ftb” resulting in a credit of 444 million due to the reversal of 409a liabilities there were no expenses or reversals related to section 409a during fiscal year 2011 

legal judgment 

aspect systems inc “aspect” sued us for breach of contract and various business torts arising out of a transaction in which we licensed aspect to sell certain of our legacy autoetch and drytek products the case went to trial in the united states district court for the district of arizona in december of 2008 resulting in a jury verdict in favor of aspect we recorded the amount of the legal judgment of 46 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june 28 2009 and final judgment was reached in fiscal year 2011 

  

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 

 

 the increase in interest income during fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to increases in our average cash and investment balances from cash provided by operations and proceeds from convertible note financing which was partially offset by treasury stock transactions and the decrease in interest rate yields the decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreases in our average cash and investment balances and decreases in interest rate yields 

the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2011 as compared with fiscal year 2010 was due to the issuance of the 900 million convertible notes during fiscal year 2011 the decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2010 as compared with the prior year was due to our 2500 million loan payment to abn amro during fiscal year 2009 principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases and to a lesser extent decreases in interest rate yields 

foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2011 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures primarily in the euro korean won and singapore dollar foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2009 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures primarily in the japanese yen taiwanese dollar and euro and were partially offset by 40 million of deferred net losses associated with ineffectiveness related to forecasted transactions that were no longer considered probable of occurring 

other expenses during fiscal year 2011 included increases in charitable contributions and banking fees primarily related to increased business transactions other expenses increased during fiscal year 2010 as compared with 2009 due to increased charitable contributions and the recognition of a 09 million realized loss on investments due to an otherthantemporary impairment charge 

income tax expense 

our annual income tax expense was 771 million 835 million and 391 million in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 was 96 194 and 148  respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the settlement of audits and tax benefit due to the extension of the second half of fiscal year 2010 federal rd credit 

the fiscal year 2010 effective tax rate was 194 compared to the fiscal year 2009 effective tax rate of 148 the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the increase in the company’s income the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our us tax return and decrease in federal rd credit due to the expiration of the credit on december 31 2009 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards were 1472 million and 1374 million at the end of fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 

  

317 million and 363 million at the end of fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively and a valuation allowance of 462 million and 370 million at the end of fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is morelikelythannot to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed our fiscal years 2011 and 2010 valuation allowance of 462 million and 370 million relate to california and certain foreign deferred tax assets 

at our fiscal year end of june 26 2011 we recorded a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance reflecting the impact of a california law repealing the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election effective for subsequent fiscal years we also recorded a reduction of valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets due to an increase in the forecasted income for certain foreign entities and an increase in the current year deferred tax liabilities 

we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have received customer acceptance completed our system installation obligations or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise 

  

released from our customer acceptance obligations we allocate revenue from multipleelement arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices provided the elements have value on a standalone basis our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return the maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straightline basis over the term of the contract when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met we record deferred revenue andor deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet 

inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale unless specified in the terms of sale title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance 

we reassess standard costs as needed but annually at a minimum and reflect achievable acquisition costs acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels methods of manufacturing and normalized overhead manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes we eliminate all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities from our consolidated financial statements 

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we provide standard warranties for our systems when appropriate we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability trends all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a systembysystem basis 

actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded as incurred 

equitybased compensation — employee stock purchase plan “espp” and employee stock plans gaap requires us to recognize the fair value of equitybased compensation in net income we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units “rsus” based upon the fair market value of company stock at the date of 

  

grant we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using the blackscholes option valuation model this model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award we amortize the fair value of equitybased awards over the vesting periods of the awards and we have elected to use the straightline method of amortization 

we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equitybased compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations we will only recognize a benefit from stockbased compensation in paidincapital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized in addition we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stockbased compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement continuing operations rather than through paidincapital we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paidincapital 

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is morelikelythannot that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made 

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we allocate the carrying value of goodwill to our reporting units we test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 

we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date in testing for a 

  

potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we are required to assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess rd and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 

under the market approach we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units we also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or failure of the company to reach its internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value in addition the value we assign to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2009 the fasb ratified guidance from the emerging issues task force “eitf” regarding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables this guidance addresses criteria for separating the consideration in multipleelement arrangements and requires companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendorspecific objective evidence or other thirdparty evidence of the selling price we adopted this guidance on june 28 2010 on a prospective basis and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

in september 2009 the fasb also ratified guidance from the eitf regarding certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this guidance modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition rules to exclude a nonsoftware components of tangible products and b software components of tangible products that are sold licensed or leased with tangible products when the software components and nonsoftware components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality we adopted this 

  

guidance on june 28 2010 on a prospective basis and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

in june 2011 the fasb issued new authoritative guidance that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income oci by eliminating the option to present components of oci as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity the amendments in this standard require that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements under either method adjustments must be displayed for items that are reclassified from oci to net income in the financial statements where the components of net income and the components of oci are presented this guidance does not affect the underlying accounting for components of oci but will change the presentation of our financial statements we will adopt this authoritative guidance retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 23 billion at the end of fiscal year 2011 compared to 9917 million at the end of fiscal year 2010 this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations and net proceeds from our convertible note financing which was partially offset by treasury stock transactions 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 881 million during fiscal year 2011 consisted of in millions 

 

 significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts included the following sources of cash increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 1381 million accounts payable of 423 million and deferred profit of 340 million partially offset by the following uses of cash increases in accounts receivable of 897 million inventories of 775 million and prepaid and other assets of 253 million these changes in overall cash were all consistent with increased business volumes 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2011 was 4799 million which was primarily due to net purchases of availableforsale securities of 3535 million and capital expenditures of 1275 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2011 was 5270 million which was primarily due to net proceeds from our convertible note financing of 8355 which includes proceeds from convertible notes and warrant sales offset by issuance fees and purchase of convertible note hedges additional sources of cash provided by financing activities include net proceeds related to issuance of common stock and reissuance of treasury stock under employee equitybased plans of 336 million and the effect of excess tax benefits on equity based compensation of 233 million this was partially offset by 2113 million in treasury stock repurchases 1496 million of net prepayments for the potential purchase of treasury stock under the structured stock repurchase arrangement see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements and 45 million in principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases 

  

liquidity 

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based upon our current business outlook we expect that our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 26 2011 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services while we have substantial cash balances in the united states and offshore we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if necessary we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 26 2011 our mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “other income expense” in our consolidated statement of operations all of our other shortterm investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities 

our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 26 2011 were as follows 

 

 we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

longterm debt 

as of june 26 2011 we had 900 million in principal amount of fixedrate longterm debt outstanding with a carrying amount of 722 million the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature generally the fair value of notes will increase as interest rates fall 

  

andor our common stock price increases and decrease as interest rates rise andor our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations we do not carry the notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our notes for disclosure purposes as of june 26 2011 the carrying value of the notes approximates fair value as interest rates on comparable debt have not changed significantly since issuance of the notes 

our longterm debt includes 12 million of variable rate debt based on libor plus a spread of 0875 and is subject to adverse as well as beneficial changes in interest expense due to fluctuation in interest rates 

equity price risk 

publicly traded securities 

the values of our investments in publicly traded securities including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans are subject to market price risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 15 or 25 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of june 26 2011 were as follows 

 

 foreign currency exchange “fx” risk 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars except for certain revenues denominated in japanese yen certain revenues and expenses denominated in the euro certain spares and service contracts denominated in various currencies and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices denominated in the related countries’ local currency we currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated revenue and monetary asset and liability exposure eurodenominated expenses and monetary assets and liabilities as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in swiss francs and taiwanese dollars we currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation 

to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue and eurodenominated expenses we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue andor expense is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of japanese yen euros swiss franc and taiwanese dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities against the us dollar the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 

  

the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 26 2011 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent 

 

 the notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges as of june 26 2011 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent these changes in fair values would be offset in other income expense net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 26 2011 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control — integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 26 2011 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part iv item 15 of this 2011 form 10k 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level future events affecting our business may cause controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met

etch process 

etch processes which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today our etch products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of semiconductor devices these products use various plasmabased technologies to create critical device features at current and future technology nodes plasma consists of charged and neutral particles that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric or conductive materials and produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit 

dielectric etch 

dielectric etch often requires etching multilayer film stacks smaller node sizes increase the complexity of the structures being etched and repeat onwafer performance remains critical in addition to the challenges introduced by new materials and scaling device manufacturers’ focus on reducing overall cost per wafer has placed an increased emphasis on the ability to etch multiple films in the same chamber in situ  

dfc technology 

productionproven in highvolume manufacturing for the past 15 years our patented dual frequency confined™ technology has been extended to incorporate multifrequency power with physically confined plasma the application of power at different frequencies provides enhanced process flexibility and allows different materials to be etched in the same chamber physical confinement of the plasma to an area directly above the wafer minimizes chemical interaction with the chamber walls eliminating potential polymer buildup that could lead to defects on the wafer confinement also enables our proprietary in situ waferless autoclean™ “wac” technology to clean chamber components after each wafer has been etched used together multifrequency and wac technologies provide a consistent process environment for every wafer preventing process drift and ensuring repeatable process results wafertowafer and chambertochamber

frequencies higher power capabilities and tunable wafer temperature meet the more demanding uniformity and profile requirements for applications at the 32 nm node and beyond 

conductor etch 

as the semiconductor industry continues to shrink critical feature sizes and improve device performance a variety of new etch challenges have emerged for conductor etch these challenges include processing smaller features new materials and new transistor structures on the wafer due to decreasing feature sizes the etch process can now require atomiclevel control across a 300 mm wafer the incorporation of new metal gates and highk dielectric materials in the device stack requires advanced multifilm etching capability furthermore the adoption of double patterning techniques to address lithography challenges at the 45 nm node and beyond is driving the etch process to define the feature on the wafer as well as to transfer the pattern into the film all of these challenges require today’s conductor etch systems to provide advanced capabilities while still providing high productivity 

tcp technology 

introduced in 1992 our transformer coupled plasma™ technology continues to provide leadingedge capability for advanced conductor etch applications at the 32 nm node and beyond by efficiently coupling radio frequency “rf” power into plasma at low pressures the tcp technology provides capability to etch nanoscale features into silicon and metal films the advanced tcp source design ensures a uniform highdensity plasma across the wafer without requiring magnetic enhancements that could cause device damage with a wide process window over a range of power chemistry and pressure combinations tcp technology provides the flexibility required to perform multiple etch steps in the same chamber

mems and deep silicon etch 

deep silicon etch is an enabling process for several emerging technologies including microelectromechanical systems “mems” devices cmos image sensors and power devices many of these technologies are increasingly being used in consumer applications such as ink jet printer heads accelerometers and inertial sensors this is driving a number of deep silicon etch applications to transition into highvolume manufacturing which requires the high levels of costeffective production typically seen in commodity semiconductor memory devices to achieve high yield in mass production the deep silicon etch process requires wafertowafer repeatability 

tcp ® 9400dsie™ deep silicon etch system

threedimensional integrated circuit etch 

the semiconductor industry is developing advanced threedimensional integrated circuits “3d ics” using throughsilicon vias “tsvs” to provide interconnect capability for dietodie and wafertowafer stacking in 

  

addition to a reduced form factor 3d ics can enhance device performance through increased speed and decreased power consumption manufacturers are currently considering a wide variety of 3d integration schemes that present an equally broad range of tsv etch requirements plasma etch technology which has been used extensively for deep silicon etching in memory devices and mems production is well suited for tsv creation 

2300 ® syndion ® throughsilicon via etch system 

the 2300 syndion etch system is based on our patented tcp technology and the productionproven 2300 versys kiyo conductor etch system the syndion system can etch multiple film stacks in the same chamber including silicon dielectric and conducting materials thereby addressing multiple tsv etch requirements 

clean process 

the manufacture of semiconductor devices involves a series of processes such as etch deposition and implantation which leave particles and residues on the surface of the wafer the wafer must generally be cleaned after these steps to remove particles and residues that could adversely impact the processes that immediately follow them and degrade device performance common wafer cleaning steps include postetch and poststrip cleans and prediffusion and predeposition cleans among others 

specific challenges at the 45 nm node and beyond include efficient particle and residue removal while minimizing substrate material loss protecting structures with fragile new materials and smaller feature sizes and efficient drying in addition management of potential defect sources at the wafer edge becomes increasingly challenging as new materials are introduced in the process flow 

singlewafer wet clean 

as device geometries shrink and new materials are introduced device flows become more complex and the number of wafer cleaning steps increases the need to have better control of the cleaning process to increase overall clean efficiency and to clean fragile structures without causing damage are reasons why chipmakers are turning to singlewafer wet clean processing technology for nextgeneration devices 

over the past decade a transition from batch to singlewafer processing has occurred for backendofline wet clean applications and a similar migration is now taking place for frontendofline wet clean applications as the need for higher particle removal efficiency without device structure damage becomes more critical singlewafer wet processing is particularly advantageous for those applications where improved defect performance removing particles without damaging the wafer pattern or enhanced selectivity and cd control can improve yield 

spin clean products sp series da vinci ®  dvprime™ 

introduced over 20 years ago sez ® spin technology for cleaning and removing films has assisted the industry transition from batch to singlewafer wet processing this proven technology provides the productivity and flexibility needed for both highvolume manufacturing and leadingedge development across multiple technology nodes and for all device types by offering advanced dilute chemistry and solvent solutions in our systems our spin wet clean systems address certain defectivity and material integrity requirements

plasmabased bevel clean 

semiconductor manufacturers are paying increasing attention to the wafer edge as a source of yield limiting defects new materials like porous lowk and organic films often do not adhere as well as traditional silicon or polymerbased films and have the potential to be significant defect sources by including cleaning steps that target the bevel region the number of good die at the wafer’s edge can be increased to maximize yield 

2300 ® coronus ® plasma bevel clean system 

the 2300 coronus plasma bevel clean system incorporates plasma technology to remove yield limiting defect sources the system combines the ability of plasma to selectively remove a wide variety of materials with a proprietary confinement technology that protects the die area incorporating our dynamic alignment technology on the productionproven 2300 platform the coronus system provides highly accurate wafer placement for repeatable process results and superior encroachment control and is designed to remove a wide range of material types in multiple applications throughout the manufacturing process flow

 customers 

our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities in fiscal year 2010 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and toshiba corporation accounted for approximately 24 15 and 11 respectively of total revenues in fiscal year 2009 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd and toshiba corporation accounted for approximately 19 and 11 respectively of total revenues in fiscal year 2008 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd and toshiba corporation accounted for approximately 19 and 13 respectively of total revenues 

a material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

in general we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers’ delivery requirements in order for a system to be included in our backlog the following conditions must be met 1 a written customer request that has been accepted 2 agreement on prices and product specifications and 3 scheduled shipment within the next 12 months the spares and services backlog includes customer orders where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not exceeding 12 months in calculating backlog amounts our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes at june 27 2010 and june 28 2009 our backlog was approximately 667 million and 391 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

  

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 13 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this report for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products nevertheless any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 13 2010 we had approximately 3232 regular employees although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our nonpublic information 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements etc our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into 

  

semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of thirdparty spare parts provider competition 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc our primary competitor in the singlewafer wet clean market is dainippon screen manufacturing co ltd 

certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do in addition we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future 

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed in them our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they alone will not determine our success our success depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this 2010 form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the semiconductor industry is subject to major fluctuations and as a result we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions 

the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems procedures for training managing and appropriately sizing our supply chain our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis 

if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline our gross margins and earnings may be impaired in late 2008 and throughout 2009 the semiconductor industry experienced a general decline in demand leading to a steep decline in demand for our products and services in response to that industry demand decline and in an effort to minimize the disruptive effects of the deteriorating economic conditions on our business operating results we made difficult resource allocation decisions including layoffs and restructurings 

during fiscal year 2010 we transitioned into what we believe to be a period of demand growth although the duration and intensity of the growth period is uncertain this is fueled in large part by increased investment by customers who during the downturn reduced or eliminated their spending on our products we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during this period of growth or we may expand our capacity too rapidly andor beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment 

especially during transitional periods resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 

future decline in the semiconductor equipment industry and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns global economic and business conditions which are often unpredictable have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally in times of economic uncertainty some of our customers’ budgets for our products or their ability to access credit to purchase them could be adversely affected this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services as a result economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of highpriced systems 

system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems are priced up to approximately 6 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a limited number of systems as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue new orders and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results as of june 27 2010 two customers accounted for approximately 24 and 22  of accounts receivable as of june 28 2009 three customers accounted for approximately 17 15 and 14 of accounts receivable 

variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which may vary from customer to customer and tool to tool such variations could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability quality or design problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace our failure to commercialize these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products moreover future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both 

  

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products and we expect our etch and clean products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of these products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products as well this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes since we are a provider of etch and clean equipment our business is affected by our customers’ use of etching and clean steps in their processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching or clean steps this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

strategic alliances may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies often one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while this could work to our advantage if our equipment becomes the basis for the function or process it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process in the latter case even if our equipment was previously used by a customer that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance 

similarly our customers may team with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results 

we are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers 

we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we have established longterm contracts with many of these suppliers these longterm contracts can take a variety of forms we may renew these contracts periodically in some cases these suppliers have sold us products during at least the last five years and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers however certain of our suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited where practical we intend to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products and generate revenues which could adversely affect our operating results and damage to our customer relationships 

  

our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 

outsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization although we attempt to select reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business 

in addition the expansive role of our outsource providers has required and may continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer andor employee relationships which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment 

we face a challenging and complex competitive environment 

we face significant competition from multiple competitors other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors especially those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products we also face competition from our own customers who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly competition may intensify and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 91 of total revenue in fiscal year 2010 85 of total revenue in fiscal year 2009 and 83 in fiscal year 2008 we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue in future years 

  

we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between china taiwan japan and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions this would adversely affect our business with china andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain of our revenues denominated in japanese yen and euros as well as certain of our spares and service contracts euro denominated expenses and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices that are denominated in the related countries’ local currency 

we currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated revenue and monetary assets and liabilities as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in swiss francs euros and taiwanese dollars we currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over or underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these other foreign currency exposures therefore we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in other currencies 

our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success 

our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and motivate key employees this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions our success in 

  

hiring depends on a variety of factors including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate key employees we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned and maintained by us our outsource providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment to the extent that these information systems are under our control we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to mitigate the outlined risks however security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws or by material audit assessments these factors could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing the need for all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us require us to suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers’ to not accept our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies such as our march 2008 acquisition of sez holding ag “sez” or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible 

  

assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors many of which are not within our control or influence these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of their stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition product liability breach of contract or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property issues we also face risks of claims from commercial and other relationships in addition our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam research in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements 

  

on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results moreover although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully compensate us for any losses that we may incur 

we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications additionally even when patents are issued the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business if they relate to critical technologies 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements has become increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations a failure to comply with these regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our business

executive summary 

we design manufacture market refurbish and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry our customers include semiconductor memory and foundry manufacturers that make dram flash memory and logic integrated circuits for a wide range of consumer and industrial electronics semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits we leverage our expertise in the areas of etch and singlewafer clean to develop processing solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates enhanced yields faster processing time andor reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards 

the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic and pronounced downturns and upturns today’s leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries supply demand prices for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop acquire and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 

adverse conditions in the global economy during 2008 and 2009 severely reduced customer demand for our products resulting in reduced revenue and profits throughout fiscal 2009 after three quarters of net losses we returned to profitability in the september 2009 quarter as worldwide demand for wafer fabrication equipment began to recover our shipments revenue and net income increased significantly in fiscal year 2010 compared to 2009 as both industry and global economic conditions continued to improve we expect the same to be true for calendar year 2010 versus calendar year 2009 given our current view of wafer fabrication equipment spending 

we believe that over the long term demand for our products will continue to increase as our customers’ capital expenditures increase to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices however historically any improvement in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment occurs at an uneven pace accordingly any forecasts about demand for wafer fabrication equipment in the near term are subject to uncertainty and we could experience significant volatility in our quarterly results of operations over the next several quarters 

  

the following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below 

 

 fiscal year 2010 results compared with fiscal year 2009 results reflect continued improvement in the global business environment and in the semiconductor industry improved foundry fabrication utilization and an increase in the rate of nextgeneration dram and nand technology conversions by leading memory companies this comparison is in sharp contrast to the decline in revenue in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 and the resulting net loss in 2009 

throughout calendar year 2009 and the first half of calendar year 2010 we maintained our investments in new product rd to defend our market share and win new application share our activities also focused on improving customer productivity in our installed base by delivering continuously improved performance and lower cost of ownership we continued to develop the operational capability to rapidly respond to short leadtime customer orders and believe that these activities will allow us to maintain and grow our cash position over time 

we believe that the total market for waferfabrication equipment will increase substantially in calendar year 2010 as compared to 2009 and currently anticipate yearonyear growth in our customer shipments as a result of both expansion of the market as a whole and increases in our market share 

while conditions in our industry have clearly improved and we currently anticipate industry and market share growth in calendar year 2010 we cannot predict the robustness or pace of any macroeconomic recovery the electronics and semiconductor industries remain significantly linked to growth in worldwide gdp and consumer spending 

fiscal year 2010 revenues increased 91 compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily reflecting increased system shipments driven by growth in customer demand fiscal year 2010 shipments were approximately 23 billion and increased 136 as compared to fiscal year 2009 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to increased revenue along with improved factory utilization and a more favorable product mix as well as a decrease in restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in cost of goods sold 

operating expenses in fiscal year 2010 decreased as compared to fiscal year 2009 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring charges and asset and goodwill impairments from approximately 141 million in fiscal year 2009 to 21 million in fiscal year 2010 and a credit in fiscal year 2010 of approximately 39 million related to a reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of matters associated with our internal revenue code section 409a expenses from the 2007 voluntary independent stock option review as compared to a charge of 3 million in fiscal year 2009 these factors were partially offset by the restoration of employee salaries and benefits as well as higher variable compensation expense associated with our improved profitability 

our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately 992 million as of june 27 2010 compared to 758 million as of june 28 2009 we generated approximately 351 million in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2010 compared to net use of cash by operating activities of 78 million in fiscal year 2009 

  

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

 

 shipments for fiscal year 2010 increased by 136 compared to fiscal year 2009 reflecting improvements in the industry and economic environment as noted above shipments for fiscal year 2009 decreased sequentially from fiscal year 2008 by 59 reflecting declines in customer demand consistent with the deterioration in the general economy and specifically the downturn in the semiconductor industry which had been impacted by a decline in consumer spending for electronic goods 

during fiscal year 2010 300 millimeter applications represented approximately 96 of total systems shipments and 96 of total systems shipments were for applications at less than or equal to the 65 nanometer technology node during fiscal year 2009 300 millimeter applications represented approximately 90 of total systems shipments and 87 of total systems shipments were for applications at less than or equal to the 65 nanometer technology node fiscal year 2010 shipments consisted of memory at approximately 61 foundry at 29 and integrated device manufacturers and logic at 10 fiscal year 2009 shipments consisted of memory at approximately 58 foundry at 21 and integrated device manufacturers and logic at 21 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 27 2010 were approximately 667 million and increased from approximately 391 million as of june 28 2009 consistent with improved spending commitments from our customers our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog 

revenue 

 

 the revenue increase during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 reflected improvements in the industry and economic environments as noted above the revenue decline during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 reflected adverse conditions in the global economy and semiconductor industry as noted above our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continues to account for a predominant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region and the concentration of revenue within the overall asia region increased in fiscal year 2010 as it had in fiscal year 2009 our deferred revenue balance increased to 2074 million as of june 27 2010 compared to 647 million as of june 28 2009 consistent with increased customer spending levels during fiscal year 2010 our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer 

  

until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 52 million as of june 27 2010 compared to 13 million as of june 28 2009 

gross margin 

 

 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to improved product mix and more favorable absorption from the factories additionally there was a decrease in restructuring and asset impairments included in gross margin from approximately 21 million in fiscal year 2009 to 3 million in fiscal year 2010 and a credit in fiscal year 2010 of approximately 6 million related to a reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of matters associated with our internal revenue code section 409a expenses from the 2007 voluntary independent stock option review 

the decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes on declining customer demand changes in our product mix customer concentration and 21 million of onetime restructuring and asset impairment expenses partially offset by favorable warranty performance 

research and development 

 

 we continue to make significant investments in rd focused on plasma etch singlewafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing products the increase in rd spending during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to higher other employee compensation salaries and benefits of 25 million mainly as a result of stronger company profitably and higher outside services and supplies of 5 million related to customer penetration activities 

approximately 24 and 79 of fiscal years 2010 and 2009 systems revenues respectively were derived from products introduced over the previous two years which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies 

the decline in rd spending during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 included approximately 8 million of lower salary and benefits related to cost savings measures 11 million in lower other employee compensation on lower profits and a 26 million decrease in outside services and supplies partially offset by 5 million in depreciation and amortization mainly related to the inclusion of the acquisition of sez in march 2008 

selling general and administrative 

 

   

the growth in sga expense during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was driven by increases of approximately 26 million in other employee compensation as a result of increased company profitability offset by a 9 million decline in depreciation rent and utilities expenses primarily as a result of restructuring activities and 7 million due to a nonrecurring accounts receivable reserve recorded for specific distressed customers in fiscal year 2009 

the decrease in sga expenses during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was driven by a reduction of approximately 34 million in other employee compensation as a result of lower company profitability a reduction of 7 million in salaries and benefits related to cost savings measures a reduction of 19 million in costs incurred as a result of the voluntary independent stock option review that was completed in fiscal year 2008 and a reduction of 5 million in outside services and supplies partially offset by a 7 million charge to increase the reserves against our receivables balance for distressed customers 

goodwill impairment 

during fiscal year 2009 a combination of factors including the economic environment a sustained decline in our market valuation and a decline in our operating results indicated possible impairment of our goodwill we performed an impairment analysis and concluded that the fair value of our clean product group had been reduced below its carrying value as a result we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of approximately 963 million during fiscal year 2009 no indicators of impairment resulted from our fiscal 2010 assessment 

the calculation of the goodwill impairment charge is based on estimates of future operating results if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our businesses an additional impairment analysis may be required which may result in further impairment charges 

restructuring and asset impairments 

during fiscal year 2008 we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges of 190 million related to the integration of sez and overall streamlining of our combined clean product group “june 2008 plan” we incurred additional expenses of 190 million under the june 2008 plan during fiscal year 2009 the charges during fiscal year 2008 included severance and related benefits costs excess facilitiesrelated costs and certain asset impairments associated with our initial product line integration road maps the charges during fiscal year 2009 primarily included severance and related benefits costs and certain asset impairments associated with our product line integration road maps during fiscal year 2010 we recorded a recovery of 22 million related primarily to inventory previously restructured in connection with our initial product line integration road maps 

during fiscal year 2009 we incurred expenses of 178 million for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to better align our cost structure with our business opportunities in consideration of market and economic uncertainties “december 2008 plan” the charges consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments 

during fiscal year 2009 we also incurred expenses of 286 million for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to align our cost structure with our outlook for the current economic environment and future business opportunities “march 2009 plan” the charges during fiscal year 2009 consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments the company incurred additional expenses of 209 million during fiscal 2010 under the march 2009 plan consisting primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases severance and related benefits costs and asset impairments 

in addition to charges incurred under specific restructuring plans during fiscal year 2010 we incurred 60 million of asset impairment charges related to production efficiencies and shifts in product demands 

for further details related to restructuring and asset impairment see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

409a expense 

following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process we considered whether section 409a of the internal revenue code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found under applicable accounting guidance to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates if a stock option is not considered as issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock it may be subject to penalty taxes under section 409a and similar provisions of state law in such a case taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic value increase but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times on march 30 2008 our board of directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees including our chief executive officer and certain executive officers relating to options that might be subject to section 409a and similar provisions of state law those liabilities totaled 509 million 445 million was recorded in operating expenses and 64 million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year 2008 we incurred 32 million of expense during fiscal year 2009 consisting of interest and legal fees during fiscal year 2010 we reached final settlement of matters associated with our 409a expenses with the internal revenue service “irs” and california franchise tax board “ftb” resulting in a credit of 444 million due to the reversal of 409a liabilities the determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in note 3 “restatement of consolidated financial statements” to consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of our 2007 form 10k 

legal judgment 

aspect systems inc “aspect” sued us for breach of contract and various business torts arising out of a transaction in which we licensed aspect to sell certain of our legacy autoetch and drytek products the case went to trial in the united states district court for the district of arizona in december of 2008 resulting in a jury verdict in favor of aspect we filed an appeal from the ensuing judgment which is now pending we recorded the amount of the legal judgment of 46 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june 28 2009 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 

 

 the decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreases in our average cash and investment balances and decreases in interest rate yields the decrease in average balances was primarily due to treasury stock repurchases capital expenditures and principal payments on longterm debt the decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in our average balances of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2009 and to a lesser extent decreases in interest rate yields the decrease in average balances was primarily related to payment of the outstanding principal balance of 2500 million of our existing longterm debt with abn amro bank nc “abn amro” during fiscal year 2009 

the decrease in interest expense during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 as compared with the prior year was due to our 2500 million loan payment to abn amro during fiscal year 2009 principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases and to a lesser extent decreases in interest rate yields 

  

foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2009 were related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures primarily in the japanese yen taiwanese dollar and euro and were partially offset by 40 million of deferred net losses associated with ineffectiveness related to forecasted transactions that were no longer considered probable of occurring and were recognized in “other income expense net” in the company’s consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2009 included in foreign exchange gains during fiscal year 2008 were gains associated with the acquisition of sez of 427 million relating primarily to the settlement of a hedge of the swiss franc these acquisitionrelated net foreign exchange gains were partially offset by other foreign exchange losses of approximately 116 million during fiscal year 2008 these offsetting losses were primarily due to our foreign currency denominated liabilities with nonus dollar functional subsidiaries where the us dollar weakened against certain currencies primarily the euro and taiwan dollar resulting in the foreign exchange loss in fiscal year 2009 we implemented a balance sheet hedging program to manage swiss franc euro and taiwanese dollar foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of those fluctuations on our consolidated statements of operations these exposures are related to monetary assets and liabilities in these currencies a description of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates can be found in the risk factors section of this report under the heading “our future success depends on international sales and management of global operations” and in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements 

other expenses increased during fiscal year 2010 as compared with 2009 as the result of increased charitable contributions and the recognition of a 09 million realized loss on investments due to an otherthantemporary impairment charge 

income tax expense 

our annual income tax expense was 835 million 391 million and 1376 million in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 was 194 148 and 239 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2010 is primarily due to the increase in the company’s income the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our us tax return and decrease in federal rd credit due to the expiration of the credit on december 31 2009 

the fiscal year 2009 effective tax rate was 148 compared to the fiscal year 2008 effective tax rate of 239 the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to the company’s loss position in fiscal year 2009 there were certain events that resulted in a net tax expense these events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our us and certain foreign income tax returns and the rd credit reinstatement offset by tax expense for a change in california law and a valuation allowance placed on certain foreign deferred tax assets 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards our gross deferred tax assets composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards were 1374 million and 1570 million at the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 363 million and 419 million at the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively and a valuation allowance of 370 million and 355 million at the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is morelikelythannot to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed our fiscal years 2010 and 2009 valuation allowance of 370 million and 355 million relate to certain california and foreign deferred tax assets 

  

during fiscal year 2010 we recorded an additional valuation allowance on certain california deferred tax assets reflecting the potential impacts of the california law related to the repeal of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election we also recorded a reduction of valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets due to an increase in the forecasted income for certain foreign entities 

we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances if any 

uncertain tax positions 

we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have completed our system installation obligations received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations we allocate revenue from multipleelement arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative fair values provided the elements have value on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control the maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straightline basis over the term of the contract 

inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which generally approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic 

  

physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale when the terms of sale do not specify title transfer we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance 

we reassess standard costs as needed but annually at a minimum and reflect achievable acquisition costs acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels methods of manufacturing and normalized overhead manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes we eliminate all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities from our consolidated financial statements 

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision 

warranty typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we provide standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance when appropriate we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability trends all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a systembysystem basis 

actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 

equitybased compensation — employee stock purchase plan “espp” and employee stock plans gaap requires us to recognize the fair value of equitybased compensation in net income we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units based upon the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using the blackscholes option valuation model this model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award we amortize the fair value of equitybased awards over the vesting periods of the awards and we have elected to use the straightline method of amortization 

we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equitybased compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations we will only recognize a benefit from stockbased compensation in paidincapital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized in addition we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stockbased compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement continuing operations rather than through paidincapital we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paidincapital 

  

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as the tax effect of carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is morelikelythannot that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 14 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is morelikelythannot that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made 

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we allocate the carrying value of goodwill to our reporting units we test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 

we review goodwill at least annually for impairment if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units we are required to assess longlived assets for impairment furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess research and development and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both market and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 

  

under the market approach we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 

in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units we also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

as a result several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods including but not limited to 1 weakening of the global economy weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry or failure of the company to reach its internal forecasts which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units and 2 a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value in addition the value we assign to intangible assets other than goodwill is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standard board “fasb” revised the applicable accounting guidance for business combinations which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired the revised guidance also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination the accounting treatment of tax benefits from acquired companies has changed under the revised guidance any changes to the tax benefits associated with the valuation allowances related to business combinations will be recorded through income tax expense we adopted the revised guidance on june 29 2009 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

in december 2007 the fasb issued guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are to be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary is initially measured at fair value we adopted the guidance on june 29 2009 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

in april 2009 the fasb issued guidance to require publiclytraded companies to disclose on the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements we adopted this guidance on june 29 2009 and the adoption resulted in expanded disclosures and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

in june 2009 the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification “codification” the codification is the single source for all authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied for financial statements issued for periods ending after september 15 2009 the codification does not change gaap and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 

in september 2009 the fasb ratified guidance from the emerging issues task force “eitf” regarding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables this guidance addresses criteria for separating the consideration in multipleelement arrangements and will require companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in 

  

the absence of vendorspecific objective evidence or other thirdparty evidence of the selling price this guidance will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 we will adopt this guidance in the beginning of fiscal year 2011 and do not believe the adoption will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

in september 2009 the fasb also ratified guidance from the eitf regarding certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this guidance modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition rules to exclude a nonsoftware components of tangible products and b software components of tangible products that are sold licensed or leased with tangible products when the software components and nonsoftware components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality this guidance will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 we will adopt this guidance in the beginning of fiscal year 2011 and do not believe the adoption will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 9917 million at the end of fiscal year 2010 compared to 7578 million at the end of fiscal year 2009 this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations which was partially offset by treasury stock purchases 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 351 million during fiscal year 2010 consisted of in millions 

 

 significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts included the following uses of cash increases in accounts receivable of 2467 million inventories of 797 million and prepaid and other expenses of 236 million these uses of cash were partially offset by the following sources of cash increases in trade accounts payable of 716 million deferred profit of 774 million and accrued expenses and other liabilities of 411 million these changes in overall cash were all consistent with increased business volumes 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2010 was 1034 million which was primarily due to net purchases of investments of 780 million and capital expenditures of 356 million these uses of cash were partially offset by transfer of restricted cash and investments of 132 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2010 was 727 million which was due to stock repurchases of 930 million and principal payments on longterm debt and capital lease obligations of 210 million these uses were partially offset by the following sources of cash proceeds from the reissuance of treasury stock of 175 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 134 million and the excess tax benefit on equitybased compensation plans of 102 million 

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based 

  

upon our current business outlook our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 27 2010 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products if we should require additional funding we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that if we require additional funds we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that any funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts consistent with gaap some of these are recorded on our balance sheet and some are not obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet include our longterm debt and capital lease obligations our offbalance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships for operating leases purchase obligations and guarantees our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to longterm debt capital leases and offbalance sheet agreements are included in the following table these amounts exclude 1105 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits because we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

 operating leases 

we lease most of our administrative rd and manufacturing facilities regional salesservice offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through fiscal year 2016 certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont california headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation 

included in the operating leases 35 years section of the table above is 1417 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our fremont california campus and properties in livermore california the remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to noncancelable facilityrelated operating leases 

capital leases 

capital leases reflect building lease obligations assumed from our acquisition of sez and an office equipment lease the amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multiyear periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments including vendorconsigned inventories we continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain 

  

activities including elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities maintenance certain information technology functions and certain transactional general and administrative functions the table presented above contains our purchase obligations at june 27 2010 under these arrangements and others actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition to these obligations certain of these agreements include early termination provisions andor cancellation penalties that could increase or decrease amounts actually paid 

consignment inventories which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined at june 27 2010 vendorowned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were 337 million 

longterm debt 

during fiscal year 2010 we made 210 million in principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases during fiscal year 2009 we paid the outstanding principal balance of 2500 million of our existing longterm debt with abn amro using existing cash balances there were no penalties associated with the payment in connection with the payment the parties agreed to terminate the abn amro credit agreement and related collateral documents abn amro continues to be a participant in our operating leases with bnp paribas leasing corporation and continues to provide banking services to us for customary fees 

our remaining total longterm debt excluding interest of 70 million as of june 27 2010 is the result of obligations we assumed in connection with our acquisition of sez consisting of various bank loans and government subsidized technology loans supporting operating needs 

guarantees 

we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our lease agreements we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to these indemnification obligations as of june 27 2010 we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees 

generally we indemnify our customers for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services under predetermined conditions and limitations we seek to limit our liability for any indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these indemnities 

warranties 

we provide standard warranties on our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance the liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system customer and geographic region modified for any known considerations such as the impact of system reliability improvements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 27 2010 the company’s mutual funds are classified as trading securities investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as “other income expense” in the consolidated statement of operations all of the company’s other shortterm investments are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

  

fixed income securities 

our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 27 2010 were as follows 

 

 we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

publicly traded securities 

the values of our investments in publicly traded securities are subject to market price risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 15 or 25 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of june 27 2010 were as follows 

 

 foreign currency derivatives 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars except for certain revenues denominated in japanese yen certain revenues and expenses denominated in the euro certain spares and service contracts denominated in various currencies and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices denominated in the related 

  

countries’ local currency we currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated revenue and monetary asset and liability exposure as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in swiss francs euros and taiwanese dollars we currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation 

to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of japanese yendenominated monetary assets and liabilities against the us dollar and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in swiss francs euros and taiwanese dollars the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income expense net assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 

the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 27 2010 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent 

 

 the notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges as of june 27 2010 are shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent these changes in fair values would be offset in other income expense net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 

 

 longterm debt 

our longterm debt includes 18 million of variable rate debt based on libor plus a spread of 0875 and is subject to adverse as well as beneficial changes in interest expense due to fluctuation in interest rates 

we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in our business activities based upon our current business outlook our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 27 2010 are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated 

  

levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products should additional funding be required we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that in the event of such requirements we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 27 2010 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control — integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 27 2010 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part iv item 15 of this 2010 form 10k 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level future events affecting our business may cause 

  

us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met

etch process 

etch processes which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today our etch products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of semiconductor devices by utilizing various plasmabased technologies to create critical device features at current and future technology nodes plasma consists of charged and neutral particles that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric or conductive materials and produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit 

dielectric etch 

for dielectric etch new materials integration often requires etching multilayer film stacks in addition to the challenges introduced by new materials and scaling device manufacturers’ desire to reduce overall cost per wafer has placed an increased emphasis on the ability to etch multiple films in the same chamber in situ  

dfc technology 

productionproven in highvolume manufacturing for nearly 15 years our patented dual frequency confined™ technology has been extended to incorporate multifrequency power with a physically confined plasma the application of power at different frequencies provides enhanced process flexibility and allows different materials to be etched in the same chamber physical confinement of the plasma to an area directly above the wafer minimizes chemical interaction with the chamber walls eliminating potential polymer buildup that could lead to defects on the wafer confinement also enables our proprietary in situ waferless autoclean™ technology to clean chamber components after each wafer has been etched used together multifrequency and wac™ technologies provide a consistent process environment for every wafer preventing process drift and ensuring repeatable process results wafertowafer and chambertochamber

conductor etch 

as the semiconductor industry continues to shrink critical feature sizes and improve device performance a variety of new etch challenges have emerged for conductor etch these challenges include processing smaller features new materials and new transistor structures on the wafer due to decreasing feature sizes the etch process can now require atomiclevel control across a 300 mm wafer the incorporation of new metal gates and highk dielectric materials in the device stack requires advanced multifilm etching capability furthermore the adoption of double patterning techniques to address lithography challenges at the 45 nm node and beyond is driving the etch process to define the feature on the wafer as well as to transfer the pattern into the film all of these challenges require today’s conductor etch systems to provide advanced capabilities while still providing high productivity 

  

tcp technology 

introduced in 1992 our transformer coupled plasma™ technology continues to provide leadingedge capability for advanced conductor etch applications at the 32 nm node and beyond by efficiently coupling radio frequency “rf” power into plasma at low pressures the tcp technology provides capability to etch nanoscale features into silicon and metal films the advanced tcp source design ensures a uniform highdensity plasma across the wafer without requiring magnetic enhancements that could cause device damage with a wide process window over a range of power chemistry and pressure combinations tcp technology provides the flexibility required to perform multiple etch steps in the same chamber

mems and deep silicon etch 

microelectromechanical systems “mems” devices are increasingly being used in consumer applications such as ink jet printer heads and inertial sensors this is driving a number of mems applications to transition into highvolume manufacturing which requires the high levels of costeffective production typically seen in commodity semiconductor memory devices to achieve high yield in mass production the mems etch process requires wafertowafer repeatability 

tcp ® 9400dsie™ deep silicon etch system 

the tcp 9400dsie system is based on our productionproven tcp 9400 silicon etch series the system’s patented highdensity tcp plasma source provides a configuration to meet the challenges of silicon deep reactive ion etch “drie” offering broad process capability and flexibility for a wide range of mems advanced packaging and power semiconductor applications incorporation of our proprietary in situ chamber cleaning technology provides etch rate stability 

threedimensional integrated circuit etch 

the semiconductor industry is developing advanced threedimensional integrated circuits “3d ics” using throughsilicon vias “tsvs” to provide interconnect capability for dietodie and wafertowafer stacking in addition to a reduced form factor 3d ics can enhance device performance through increased speed and decreased power consumption manufacturers are currently considering a wide variety of 3d integration schemes that present an equally broad range of tsv etch requirements plasma etch technology which has been used extensively for deep silicon etching in memory devices and mems production is well suited for tsv creation 

2300 ® syndion ® throughsilicon via etch system 

the 2300 syndion etch system is based on our patented tcp technology and the productionproven 2300 versys kiyo conductor etch system the syndion system can etch multiple film stacks in the same chamber including silicon dielectric and conducting materials thereby addressing multiple tsv etch requirements 

clean process 

the manufacture of semiconductor devices involves a series of processes such as etch deposition and implantation which leave particles and residues on the surface of the wafer the wafer must generally be cleaned after these steps to remove particles and residues that could adversely impact the processes that immediately 

  

follow them and degrade device performance common wafer cleaning steps include postetch and poststrip cleans and prediffusion and predeposition cleans among others 

specific challenges at the 45 nm node and beyond include efficient particle and residue removal while minimizing substrate material loss protecting structures with fragile new materials and smaller feature sizes and efficient drying in addition management of potential defect sources at the wafer edge becomes increasingly challenging as new materials are introduced in the process flow 

singlewafer wet clean 

as device geometries shrink and new materials are introduced device flows become more complex and the number of wafer cleaning steps increases the need to increase overall clean efficiency and clean fragile structures without causing damage are reasons why chipmakers are turning to singlewafer wet clean processing technology for nextgeneration devices 

over the past decade a transition from batch to singlewafer processing has occurred for backendofline wet clean applications and a similar migration for frontendofline wet clean applications appears to be occurring as the need for higher particle removal efficiency without device structure damage becomes more critical singlewafer wet processing is particularly advantageous for those applications where improved defect performance removing particles without damaging the wafer pattern or enhanced selectivity and cd control can improve yield 

singlewafer spin clean products sp series da vinci ®  dvprime™ 

with the acquisition of sez holding ag “sez” in march 2008 we have expanded our portfolio to include singlewafer spin systems in addition to gaining more than 20 years of experience in clean technology and a substantial installed customer base this singlewafer sez ® spin technology for cleaning and removing films has assisted the industry transition from batch to singlewafer wet processing by offering advanced dilute chemistry and solvent solutions in our systems our singlewafer spin clean systems address certain defectivity and material integrity requirements 

singlewafer linear clean product 2300 ® serene™ 

to meet the challenges of smaller critical dimensions increasing aspect ratios and new materials integration our 2300 serene wet clean system is targeted at applications requiring highselectivity residue removal without damaging sensitive device structures the system’s c3™ confined chemical cleaning™ technology combines linear wafer motion with chemicallydriven singlewafer cleaning to remove residues with chemical exposure times as short as a few seconds the cleaning exposure time is optimized for efficient removal of the target materials while limiting the impact on critical materials this technology addresses applications that require highselectivity cleaning such as highk metal gate postetch clean 

plasmabased bevel clean 

semiconductor manufacturers are paying increasing attention to the wafer edge as a source of yield limiting defects new materials like porous lowk and organic films often do not adhere as well as traditional silicon or polymerbased films and have the potential to be significant defect sources by including cleaning steps that target the bevel region the number of good die at the wafer’s edge can be increased to maximize yield 

2300 ® coronus™ plasmabased bevel clean system

research and development 

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to obtain and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to rd programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 were 2883 million 3238 million and 2853 million respectively the majority of rd spending is targeted at etch and plasmabased technology applications with an increasing proportion focused on adjacent markets including singlewafer clean and pre and postetch step opportunities we believe current challenges for customers in the pre and postetch applications present opportunities for us 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs support our growth strategy and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service 

our marketing sales and service efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet their needs these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions for their wafer processing needs we maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of service engineers in place throughout the united states europe taiwan korea japan and asia pacific we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace 

we offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance the warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to agreedupon specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired 

international sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls compliance with us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions and economic and political conditions any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows revenue by region was as follows 

 

   

customers 

our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunity in fiscal year 2009 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd and toshiba corporation accounted for approximately 19 and 11 respectively of total revenues in fiscal year 2008 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd and toshiba corporation accounted for approximately 19 and 13 respectively of total revenues in fiscal year 2007 revenues from hynix semiconductor and samsung electronics company ltd each accounted for approximately 14 of total revenues 

a material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes in general we schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers’ delivery requirements included in our systems backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted prices and product specifications have been agreed upon and shipment of systems is expected within one year the spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not exceeding 12 months in calculating backlog amounts 

as of june 28 2009 and june 29 2008 our backlog was approximately 391 million and 410 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes nor actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 13 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 herein for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies included in our products are only obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

  

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production and cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 20 2009 we had approximately 2711 regular employees 

each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our proprietary information and with our statement of standards of business conduct in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements etc our ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node provided that there is demonstrated performance to specification by the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of thirdparty spare parts provider competition we face significant competition with all of our products and services certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do in addition we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc our primary competitor in the singlewafer wet clean market is dainippon screen manufacturing co ltd 

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of 

  

united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they alone will not determine our success which depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k as of and for the year ended june 28 2009 the “2009 form 10k”

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this 2009 form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

we face risks related to the deterioration in the general economic outlook and the downturn in the semiconductor industry 

current global economic conditions have impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors additionally some of our customers’ ability to access credit has been adversely affected which limits their ability to purchase our products and services the degree of the impact on our business of the current credit and economic environment will continue to depend on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the recession facing the us economy and the global economy generally and the semiconductor industry specifically this impact may cause potential material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations our operating results may be adversely affected because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 further because a significant amount of our rd and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont california campus natural physical logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities including labor disruptions earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance 

we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of highpriced systems 

system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems are priced up to approximately 6 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems as a result the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter 

variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which may vary from customer to customer and tool to tool such variations could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably 

fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our financial results 

  

we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products moreover future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of these products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products as well this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment our business is affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue new orders and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

  

strategic alliances may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies often one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while this could work to our advantage if our equipment becomes the basis for the function or process it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process in the latter case even if our equipment was previously used by a customer that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance 

similarly our customers may team with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines these actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business 

we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers 

we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we have established longterm contracts with many of these suppliers these longterm contracts can take a variety of forms we may renew these contracts periodically in some cases these suppliers sold us products during at least the last five years and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers however several of our suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships 

our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 

outsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business 

in addition the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships andor have a negative effect on our operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment 

  

we are subject to risks associated with our competitors’ strategic relationships and their introduction of new products and we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share 

we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently or expect to offer they may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 85 in fiscal year 2009 83 in fiscal year 2008 and 84 in fiscal year 2007 of our total revenue we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations and international sales including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex 

  

relationships between china taiwan japan and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with china andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars however we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain of our revenues denominated in japanese yen and euros and to certain of our spares and service contracts and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices which are denominated in the related countries’ local currency 

we currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated assets and forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue and on net intercompany liability exposures denominated in swiss francs euros and taiwanese dollars we currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over or underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we are exposed to shortterm foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on nonus dollardenominated assets and liabilities other than those currency exposures previously discussed and currently do not enter into such foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these other foreign currency exposures and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in other currencies 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws or by material audit assessments which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing the need for all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

if we are unable to adjust the scale of our business in response to rapid changes in demand in the semiconductor equipment industry our operating results and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired 

the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and resources allocated to 

  

operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures and in training managing and appropriately sizing our supply chain our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively if we do not adequately meet these challenges our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies such as our march 2008 acquisition of sez or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors including but not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our common stock 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment to the extent that these information systems are under our control we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to address the outlined risks however security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

intellectual property indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam research we also face risks of claims from commercial and other relationships in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results moreover although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur 

we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise continuing our development of new systems increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers however we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications in addition the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages 

  

we are subject to the internal control evaluation and attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002

the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions generally and in the semiconductor industry supply demand prices for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop acquire and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this 2009 form 10k mda consists of the following sections

executive summary 

we design manufacture market and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits we leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated and standalone processing solutions which typically benefit our customers through reduced cost lower defect rates enhanced yields or faster processing time as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards 

the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical and dependent on overall world economic conditions recent adverse conditions in the global economy have significantly reduced customer demand for our products while our ability to predict the demand for wafer fabrication equipment in the future is 

  

limited we believe that over the long term demand for our products will increase as customers’ capital expenditures increase to meet demand for semiconductor devices however our visibility for shipment volumes over the next few quarters remains very limited and as a result we remain cautious about forecasting any significant resumption in equipment spending in the near term 

the following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below in thousands except percentages and per share amounts 

 

 fiscal year 2009 results compared with fiscal year 2008 results reflect declines in customer demand consistent with the deterioration in the general economic outlook and specifically the downturn in the semiconductor industry which has been impacted by a decline in consumer spending for electronic goods fiscal year 2009 shipments were approximately 10 billion and decreased 59 compared to fiscal year 2008 fiscal year 2009 revenues decreased 55 compared to fiscal year 2008 

gross margin as a percent of revenue was 348 for fiscal year 2009 and decreased sequentially compared to fiscal year 2008 gross margin of 474 this reduction was primarily due to customer concentration product mix and decreased factory and field utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes on declining customer demand partially offset by favorable warranty performance included in gross margin were charges for restructuring and asset impairments of 210 million and 126 million in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively 

fiscal year 2009 operating expenses include goodwill impairment of 963 million restructuring and asset impairments of 445 million a legal judgment of 46 million and 32 million of expenses associated with the assumption of section 409a employee liabilities fiscal year 2008 operating expenses include the assumption of section 409a employee liabilities of 445 million and 64 million of restructuring and asset impairments we continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leadingedge plasma etch singlewafer clean and other new products and technologies 

although there are nearterm pressures on business from declining customer demand we are targeting the longer term benefits of our product development activities these factors along with decreasing revenues and lower gross margins noted above contributed to the fiscal year 2009 operating loss of 252 compared to fiscal year 2008 operating margin of 206 

in both the etch and clean markets we believe there are opportunities for market share expansion as we have placed a significant number of joint development projects and evaluation units at our customers’ locations to enable penetration of new applications while defending and growing our existing market share 

we anticipate that while there are opportunities to add to our leading etch market share position significant market share growth opportunities will be in singlewafer clean we intend to increase the penetration of various applications at our existing single wafer clean customers as well as at customers who will be introducing single wafer cleaners into their fabs 

our key positions of strength in singlewafer clean have historically been in the backendofline foundry and logic markets and spending for new equipment in those markets has recently been low resulting in temporarily exacerbated reductions in revenue and market share for our equipment when new capacity is added in the foundry and logic markets we expect our market share will increase with our current tool of record positions 

due to the current high volume of idled capacity potentially requiring remanufacture and upgrade we anticipate that installed base upgrade and conversion activity will represent a meaningful revenue opportunity for us over the next few years this opportunity is particularly substantial in etch where new technology capability is typically required to meet leading edge requirements at the next technology node 

  

we recently established our reliant™ system business in order to increase our focus on and capabilities in the refurbishment and upgrades business opportunities that we expect in etch we have also recently added clean refurbishment and upgrades capabilities in order to support our customers’ needs in respect of the installed base of single wafer cleaners in today’s etch market our customers have idled equipment available for refurbishment or upgrade that has temporarily reduced the total demand for new equipment purchases at the leading edge this is particularly the case at our memory customers once demand accelerates and capacity utilization rises we anticipate that our customers’ requirements for refurbishment or upgrade will diminish and most leading edge wafer start additions will be filled by new equipment 

some older installed base tools cannot be refurbished or upgraded for reuse on the leading edge but they can be utilized in trailing edge foundries where 300millimeter tool sets are needed we intend to be very active in the used 300millimeter tool set market as it develops in the coming quarters 

in this period of reduced customer spending we have continued to make major investments in product portfolios as we believe they represent a significant growth opportunity when the upturn comes we do however remain focused on balancing the need to invest in next generation technologies with carefully managing the cash expenditures of the company 

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

 

 shipments for the fiscal year 2009 decreased sequentially by 59 reflecting the industry and economic environment noted above during fiscal year 2009 300 millimeter applications represented approximately 90 of total systems shipments and 87 of total systems shipments were for applications at less than or equal to the 65 nanometer technology node we classify systems shipments market segmentation for fiscal year 2009 as memory at approximately 58 integrated device manufacturers and logic at 21 and foundry at 21 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 28 2009 were approximately 391 million and decreased from approximately 410 million as of june 29 2008 consistent with reduced spending commitments from our customers the basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this 2009 form 10k for additional information on our backlog policy our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provisions of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes 

revenue 

 

   

the sequential revenue decline during fiscal year 2009 reflects the industry and economic environments noted above our revenue levels are correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continues to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region our deferred revenue balance decreased to 647 million as of june 28 2009 compared to 1936 million as of june 29 2008 consistent with the decline in customer spending levels during fiscal year 2009 our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately 13 million as of june 28 2009 compared to 52 million as of june 29 2008 

gross margin 

 

 gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2009 was 348 the decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes on declining customer demand changes in our product mix customer concentration and 210 million of onetime restructuring and asset impairment expenses partially offset by favorable warranty performance the decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to decreased factory utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes as well as customer concentration and product mix challenges 126 million of onetime restructuring and asset impairment expenses related to the streamlining of our combined clean product group following the acquisition of sez and 64 million of expense associated with the assumption of the employee tax liabilities as a result of the determinations from our voluntary independent stock option review 

research and development 

 

 we continue to make significant investments in rd focused on plasma etch single wafer clean and new products the decline in rd spending during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 includes approximately 8 million of lower salary and benefits related to cost savings measures 11 million in lower other employee compensation on lower profits and a 26 million decrease in outside services and supplies partially offset by 5 million in depreciation and amortization mainly related to the inclusion of sez approximately 91 and 74 of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 systems revenues respectively were derived from products introduced over the previous two years which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies 

the growth in rd spending during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 included approximately 22 million in salary and benefits costs for increases in headcount and employee base compensation 9 million in engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch and new product growth objectives the inclusion of sez operations for approximately four months of fiscal year 2008 and a 3 million decrease in incentivebased compensation driven by reduced profit levels 

  

selling general and administrative 

 

 the decrease in sga expenses during fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 was driven by reductions of approximately 34 million in other employee compensation as a result of lower company profitability and 7 million in salaries and benefits related to cost savings measures 19 million in cost incurred as a result of the voluntary stock option reviews completed in fiscal year 2008 and 5 million in outside services and supplies partially offset by a 7 million charge to increase the reserves against our receivables balance for distressed customers 

the increase in sga expenses during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was driven by increases of approximately 24 million in salary and benefits costs for increases in headcount 19 million in legal and accounting cost incurred as a result of the voluntary stock option review the inclusion of sez operations for approximately four months and 3 million in equitybased compensation partially offset by a decrease of 5 million in incentivebased compensation triggered by lower profit levels 

goodwill impairment 

a combination of factors including the current economic environment a sustained decline in our market valuation and a decline in our operating results were indicators of possible impairment of our goodwill we performed an impairment analysis and concluded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards number 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” that the fair value of our clean product group has been reduced below its carrying value as a result we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of approximately 963 million during fiscal year 2009 

the calculation of the goodwill impairment charge is based on estimates of future operating results if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our clean product group an additional impairment analysis may be required which may result in further impairment charges 

restructuring and asset impairments 

during the june 2008 quarter we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the integration of sez and overall streamlining of our combined clean product group “june 2008 plan” we incurred additional expenses under the june 2008 plan during the quarter ended september 28 2008 the charges during the june 2008 quarter included severance and related benefits costs excess facilitiesrelated costs and certain asset impairments associated with our initial product line integration road maps the charges during the september 2008 quarter primarily included severance and related benefits costs and certain asset impairments associated with our product line integration road maps 

during the december 2008 quarter we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to better align our cost structure with our business opportunities in consideration of market and economic uncertainties “december 2008 plan” the charges during the december 2008 quarter consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments 

during the march 2009 quarter we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges designed to align our cost structure with our outlook for the current economic environment and future business opportunities “march 2009 plan” the charges during the march 2009 quarter consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments we incurred additional expenses under the march 2009 plan during the quarter ended june 28 2009 the charges during the june 2009 quarter consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs as well as certain facilities related costs and asset impairments 

  

prior to the end of each quarter noted above we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the june 2008 plan the december 2008 plan and the march 2009 plan severance packages to affected employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit the termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced the amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based in part on the opinions of independent real estate experts leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off as these items will have no future economic benefit to the company and have been abandoned 

we distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product facility or service 

we recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments during fiscal year 2009 of approximately 655 million consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of 520 million charges for the writeoff of certain assets totaling 102 million and charges for the present value of remaining lease payments net of sublease income on vacated facilities of 33 million of the total 655 million in charges 210 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and 445 million was recorded in operating expenses in our fiscal year 2009 consolidated statement of operations 

we recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments during fiscal year 2008 of approximately 190 million consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of 55 million charges for the present value of remaining lease payments net of sublease income on vacated facilities of 09 million the writeoff of related fixed assets of 19 million and asset impairments related to initial product line integration road maps of 107 million of the total 190 million in charges 126 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and 64 million was recorded in operating expenses in our fiscal year 2008 consolidated statement of operations 

as a result of the june 2008 september 2008 december 2008 march 2009 and june 2009 quarters’ restructuring activities we expect annual savings in total expenses relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities of approximately 179 million to 189 million the estimated savings from the june 2008 december 2008 and march 2009 plans’ discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll facilities and depreciation expenses actual savings may vary from these forecasts depending upon future events and circumstances

 the severance and benefitsrelated balance is anticipated to be paid by the end of fiscal year 2010 the facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments net of sublease income on vacated buildings and is expected to be paid by the end of fiscal year 2015 

409a expense 

following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process we considered whether section 409a of the internal revenue code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found under apb no 25 to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates if a stock option is not considered as issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock it may be subject to penalty taxes under section 409a and similar provisions of state law in such a case such taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic value increase but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times on march 30 2008 our board of directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees including our chief executive officer and certain executive officers relating to options that might be subject to section 409a and similar provisions of state law those liabilities totaled 509 million 445 million was recorded in operating expenses and 64 million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year 2008 we incurred 32 million of expense during fiscal year 2009 consisting of interest and legal fees we are presently discussing with the internal revenue service the application of section 409a to company stock options the determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in note 3 “restatement of consolidated financial statements” to consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of our 2007 form 10k 

legal judgment 

aspect systems inc “aspect” sued us for breach of contract and various business torts arising out of a transaction in which we licensed aspect to sell certain of our legacy autoetch and drytek products the case went to trial in the united states district court for the district of arizona in december of 2008 resulting in a jury verdict in favor of aspect we filed an appeal from the ensuing judgment which is now pending we recorded the amount of the legal judgment of 46 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june 28 2009 

  

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 

 

 the decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 is primarily due to a decrease in our average balances of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2009 and to a lesser extent decreases in interest rate yields the decrease in average balances was primarily related to payment of the outstanding principal balance of 2500 million of our existing longterm debt with abn amro bank nc “abn amro” during fiscal year 2009 the sequential decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2008 as compared with fiscal year 2007 is primarily related to decreases in average balances of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments primarily driven by the acquisition of sez 

the decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2009 as compared with the prior year was due to our 2500 million loan payment to abn amro and to a lesser extent decreases in interest rate yields the sequential decrease in interest expense in fiscal year 2008 as compared with fiscal year 2007 is primarily related to the 100 million repayment on our longterm debt during fiscal year 2007 and a decline in interest rates 

foreign exchanges gains in fiscal year 2009 are due to forecast variances and are related to unhedged portions of the balance sheet exposures primarily in the japanese yen taiwanese dollar and euro and were partially offset by 40 million of deferred net losses net of tax associated with ineffectiveness related to forecasted transactions that were no longer considered probable of occurring and were recognized in “other income expense net” in the company’s consolidated statements of operations during the twelve months ended june 28 2009 included in foreign exchange gains during fiscal year 2008 are gains associated with the acquisition of sez of 427 million relating primarily to the settlement of a hedge of the swiss franc these acquisitionrelated net foreign exchange gains were partially offset by other foreign exchange losses of approximately 116 million during fiscal year 2008 which were primarily due to our foreign currency denominated liabilities with nonus dollar functional subsidiaries where the us dollar weakened against certain currencies primarily the euro and taiwan dollar resulting in the foreign exchange loss in fiscal year 2009 we implemented a balance sheet hedging program to manage swiss franc euro and taiwanese dollar foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of those fluctuations on our consolidated statements of operations these exposures are related to the net intercompany liability positions in these currencies a description of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates can be found in the risk factors section of this 2009 form 10k under the heading “our future success depends on international sales and management of global operations” 

the favorable legal judgment of 158 million during fiscal year 2007 was obtained in a lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of our customers the supreme court of california denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in our favor during the quarter ended september 24 2006 

income tax expense 

our annual income tax expense was 391 million 1376 million and 1619 million in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 was 148 239 and 191 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2009 is primarily due to the company’s loss position in fiscal year 2009 there were certain events that resulted in a net tax expense these 

  

events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our us and certain foreign income tax returns and the rd credit reinstatement offset by tax expense for a change in california law and a valuation allowance placed on certain foreign deferred tax assets 

the fiscal year 2008 effective tax rate was 239 compared to the fiscal year 2007 effective tax rate of 191 the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2008 is primarily due to the application of certain foreign tax rulings a decrease in the proportion of income in low tax jurisdictions as well as the expiration of the federal research tax credit which expired on december 31 2007 the increase was partially offset by certain events resulting in a net tax benefit of 116 million these events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our us and certain foreign income tax returns and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now settled 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes our gross deferred tax assets primarily comprised of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards were 1570 million and 1730 million at the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 419 million and 531 million at the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively and a valuation allowance of 355 million and 34 million at the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed our current valuation allowance of 355 million relates to certain california and foreign deferred tax assets and our fiscal year 2008’s valuation allowance of 34 million relates to certain foreign deferred tax assets 

as part of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal year 2009 we recorded a valuation allowance on certain california deferred tax assets reflecting the potential impacts of the new california law related to the repeal of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election both passed february 20 2009 effective for years beginning on or after january 1 2011 in addition we recorded a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets for which management believes it is not more likely than not to be realized 

we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances if any 

fin 48 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas 109 accounting for income taxes fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition on june 25 2007 upon adoption of fin 48 the cumulative effect of applying fin 48 was reported as an increase of the beginning balance of retained earnings of approximately 176 million 

we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have completed our system installation obligations received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations revenue from multipleelement arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values provided the elements have value on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract 

inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which generally approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale when the terms of sale do not specify title transfer we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance 

standard costs are reassessed as needed but annually at a minimum and reflect achievable acquisition costs acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels methods of manufacturing and overhead for internally manufactured products manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess 

  

finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost estimates of market value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions and possible alternative uses if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 

warranty typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance when appropriate we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability trends all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a systembysystem basis 

actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 

equitybased compensation — employee stock purchase plan and employee stock plans we account for our employee stock purchase plan “espp” and other stock plans under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sfas no 123r” sfas no 123r requires the recognition of the fair value of equitybased compensation in net income the fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant the fair value of our stock options and espp awards was estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing sfas no 123r including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straightline method for awards granted after the adoption of sfas no 123r and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r 

we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equitybased compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r we will only recognize a benefit from stockbased compensation in paidincapital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized in addition we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stockbased compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement continuing operations rather than through paidincapital we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under accounting principles board no 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paidincapital in accordance with footnote 82 of sfas no 123r 

income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to 

  

earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 

we provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates our estimated effective income tax rate reflects our underlying profitability the level of rd spending the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed we carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate if necessary if actual results differ from estimates we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation 48 “accounting for income tax uncertainties” “fin 48” fin 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “morelikelythannot” to be sustained by the taxing authority it provides guidance on the derecognition measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties along with any related interest and penalties fin 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 

goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually sfas no 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” 

we review goodwill at least annually for impairment should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we 1 allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates 2 estimate the fair value of our reporting units and 3 determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function furthermore if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as inprocess research and development and developed technology only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment if any be determined 

  

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit in addition we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units we also consider our and our competitor’s market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 

the value assigned to intangible assets is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

on june 30 2008 we adopted the required portions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of sfas no 157 this statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 currently applies to all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis in february 2008 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no “fsp” 1572 delaying the effective date of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis the delayed portions of sfas no 157 will be adopted by us beginning in our fiscal year ending june 27 2010 in october 2008 the fasb issued fsp sfas 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active” which clarifies the application of statement 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive specifically fsp sfas 1573 clarifies how 1 management’s internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present 2 observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account and 3 the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value the guidance of fsp sfas 1573 is effective immediately and we adopted its provisions with respect to our financial assets and liabilities since september 28 2008 the impact of adopting the nondelayed portions of sfas no 157 is more fully described in note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value this statement was effective for us beginning june 30 2008 we have not applied the fair value option to any items therefore the statement did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas no 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after december 15 2008 we will adopt sfas no 141r in the beginning of fiscal year 2010 the accounting treatment of tax benefits from acquired companies will change when sfas no 141r becomes effective at such time any changes to the tax benefits associated with the valuation allowance recorded in the sez acquisition will be recorded through income tax expense where currently the accounting treatment would require any adjustment to be recognized through the purchase price as an adjustment to goodwill 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb 51” “sfas no 160” sfas 160 

  

establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary will be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary is initially measured at fair value sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the adoption of sfas no 160 will result in the reclassification of minority interests to stockholders’ equity we expect to adopt sfas no 160 in the beginning of fiscal year 2010 and we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 160 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

on december 29 2008 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement 133” “sfas no 161” there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of sfas no 161 which requires expanded and enhanced disclosure for derivative instruments including those used in hedging activities see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position statement of financial accounting standards 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” “fsp sfas 1423” fsp sfas 1423 provides guidance with respect to estimating the useful lives of recognized intangible assets acquired on or after the effective date and requires additional disclosure related to the renewal or extension of the terms of recognized intangible assets fsp sfas 1423 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2008 the adoption of fsp sfas 1423 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp sfas 1574 “determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly” “fsp sfas 1574” which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with sfas no 157 when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased this fsp reemphasizes that regardless of market conditions the fair value measurement is an exit price concept as defined in sfas no 157 this fsp clarifies and includes additional factors to consider in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset or liability and provides additional clarification on estimating fair value when the market activity for an asset or liability has declined significantly the scope of this fsp does not include assets and liabilities measured under level 1 inputs fsp sfas 1574 is applied prospectively to all fair value measurements where appropriate and is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june 15 2009 we adopted fsp sfas 1574 during the quarter ended june 28 2009 the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp sfas 1071 and apb 281 “interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” “fsp sfas 1071 and apb 281” fsp sfas 1071 and apb 281 amends sfas no 107 “disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” to require publiclytraded companies as defined in apb opinion no 28 “interim financial reporting” to provide disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements fsp sfas 1071 and apb 281 is effective for interim periods ending after june 15 2009 the adoption of fsp sfas 1071 and apb 281 will result in expanded disclosures but will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fasb staff position statement of financial accounting standards 1152 and 1242 “recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments” “fsp sfas 1152” this fsp amends the requirements for the recognition and measurement of otherthantemporary impairments for debt securities by modifying the preexisting “intent and ability” indicator under fsp sfas 1152 for impaired debt securities an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the security it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery or the security is not expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security additionally fsp sfas 1152 changes the presentation of otherthantemporary impairments in the income statement for those impairments attributed to credit losses fsp sfas 1152 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 we adopted fsp sfas 1152 on march 30 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by fsp sfas 1152 

  

in may 2009 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards number 165 “subsequent events” “sfas no 165” which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued sfas no 165 requires the disclosure of the date at which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date that is whether the date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued the provisions of sfas no 165 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 in accordance with sfas no 165 we evaluated subsequent events through august 26 2009 the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements during the periods from june 28 2009 to august 26 2009 we did not have any material recognizable subsequent events 

liquidity and capital resources 

total gross cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances were 7578 million at the end of fiscal year 2009 compared to 12 billion at the end of fiscal year 2008 this decrease was primarily due to our payment of the outstanding principal balance of our longterm debt with abn amro bank nv of 250 million during fiscal year 2009 cash used for operations of 781 million and capital expenditures of 443 million 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash used for operating activities of 781 million during fiscal year 2009 consisted of in millions 

 

 significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts included the following uses of cash a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately 1773 million primarily related to decreases in taxes payable accrued compensation and installation and warranty liabilities additional uses of cash included decreases in accounts payable and deferred profit all of these changes were primarily attributable to lower business volume these uses of cash were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of 1521 million inventories of 461 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of 59 million which were also primarily due to lower business volume 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2009 was 60 million which was primarily due to net salesmaturities of investments of 1738 million partially offset by a transfer of restricted cash and investments of 922 million capital expenditures of 443 million and acquisitions of businesses of 195 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2009 was 2608 million which was primarily due to principal payments on longterm debt and capital leases of 2560 million which included our payment of the outstanding principal balance of our longterm debt with abn amro bank nv of 250 million during fiscal year 2009 

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based 

  

upon our current business outlook our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 28 2009 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products should additional funding be required we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that in the event of such requirements we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and include our longterm debt which is outlined in the following table and discussed below our offbalance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table the amounts in the table below exclude 1030 million of liabilities under fin 48 as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement see note 14 “income taxes” of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

 operating leases 

we lease most of our administrative rd and manufacturing facilities regional salesservice offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through fiscal year 2016 certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont california headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation 

included in the operating leases over 5 years section of the table above is 1417 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our fremont california campus and properties in livermore california 

on december 18 2007 and as amended on april 3 2008 and july 9 2008 we entered into a series of two operating leases the “livermore leases” regarding certain improved properties in livermore california on december 21 2007 we entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases the “new fremont leases” and collectively with the livermore leases the “operating leases” with regard to certain improved properties at our headquarters in fremont california each of the operating leases is an offbalance sheet arrangement the operating leases and associated documents for each operating lease were entered into by us and bnp paribas leasing corporation “bnpplc” 

each livermore lease facility has an approximately sevenyear term inclusive of an initial construction period during which bnpplc’s and our obligations were governed by the construction agreement entered into 

  

with regard to such livermore lease facility ending on the first business day in january 2015 each new fremont lease has an approximately sevenyear term ending on the first business day in january 2015 on december 1 2008 we completed construction of one of the two livermore properties we completed construction on the second property on june 1 2009 upon completion of construction our occupation of each livermore property was no longer governed by its construction agreement and was instead governed by the relevant operating lease 

under each operating lease we may at our discretion and with 30 days’ notice elect to purchase the property that is the subject of the operating lease for an amount approximating the sum required to prepay the amount of bnpplc’s investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid rent any such amount may also include an additional makewhole amount for early redemption of the outstanding investment which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment 

we are required pursuant to the terms of the operating leases and associated documents to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately 1649 million in separate interestbearing accounts as security for our obligations under the operating leases as of june 28 2009 we had 1649 million recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet as collateral required under the lease agreements related to the amounts currently outstanding on the facility 

upon expiration of the term of an operating lease the property subject to that operating lease may be remarketed we have guaranteed to bnpplc that each property will have a certain minimum residual value as set forth in the applicable operating lease the aggregate guarantee made by us under the operating leases is no more than approximately 1417 million although under certain default circumstances the guarantee with regard to an operating lease may be 100 of bnpplc’s investment in the applicable property in the aggregate the amounts payable under such guarantees will be no more than 1649 million plus related indemnification or other obligations 

the lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity vie as defined by fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us 

the remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to noncancelable facilityrelated operating leases 

capital leases 

capital leases reflect building lease obligations assumed from our acquisition of sez and an office equipment lease the amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multiyear periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments including vendorconsigned inventories we continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities including elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities maintenance certain information technology functions and certain transactional general and administrative functions the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our obligations at june 28 2009 under these arrangements and others actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition to these obligations certain of these agreements include early termination provisions andor cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid 

consignment inventories which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined at june 28 2009 vendorowned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were 134 million 

longterm debt 

during fiscal year 2009 we paid the outstanding principal balance of 2500 million of our existing longterm debt with abn amro bank nv “abn amro” using existing cash balances there were no penalties 

  

associated with the payment in connection with the payment the parties agreed to terminate the abn amro credit agreement and related collateral documents abn amro continues to be a participant in our operating leases with bnp paribas leasing corporation and continues to provide banking services to us for customary fees 

our remaining total longterm debt of 271 million as of june 28 2009 is the result of obligations assumed in connection with the acquisition of sez consisting of various bank loans and government subsidized technology loans supporting operating needs 

guarantees 

we account for our guarantees in accordance with fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” “fin 45” fin 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued fin 45 also requires a company the guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 

we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements we have entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit our exposure to such indemnifications as of june 28 2009 we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees 

generally we indemnify under predetermined conditions and limitations our customers for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees 

warranties 

we offer standard warranties on our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance the liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system customer and geographic region modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities as of june 28 2009 these securities are classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

  

fixed income securities 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate longterm debt at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 282009 are as follows 

 

 we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

publicly traded equity securities 

the values of our equity investments in publicly traded equity securities are subject to equity price risk the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 15 25 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of june 28 2009 are as follows 

 

 foreign currency derivatives 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues that are denominated in japanese yen certain revenues and expenses denominated in the euro certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in various currencies and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices which are denominated in the related countries’ local currency we currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated assets and forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue and on net intercompany liability exposures denominated in swiss francs euros and taiwanese dollars we currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation 

  

to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted japanese yendenominated revenues we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of japanese yendenominated net receivable balances against the us dollar and net intercompany liability exposures denominated in swiss francs euros and taiwanese dollars the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables also recorded in other income and expense assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 

the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of june 29 2008 is shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent 

 

 the notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges as of june 28 2009 is shown in the table below this table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plusorminus 10 percent and plusorminus 15 percent these changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 

 

 longterm debt 

our longterm debt includes 33 million of variable rate debt based on local libor rates plus a spread of 0875 and is subject to adverse as well as beneficial changes in interest expense due to fluctuation in interest rates 

we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in our business activities based upon our current business outlook our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 28 2009 are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months however the current uncertainty in the global economic conditions and the recent disruption in credit markets have impacted customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors if the current situation deteriorates further our business could suffer further negative impacts

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 28 2009 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer along with our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control — integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 28 2009 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part iv item 15 of this 2009 form 10k 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met

we design manufacture market and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits we leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated processing solutions which typically benefit our customers through reduced cost lower defect rates enhanced yields or faster processing time 

etch process 

etch processes which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today lam research etch products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of semiconductors by utilizing various plasmabased technologies to create critical device features at current and future technology nodes plasma consists of charged and neutral species that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric metal or polysilicon material and produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit 

advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of creating structures for the 45 nanometer nm and below technology nodes at this time memory manufacturers are transitioning from aluminum to copper conductive lines while leading logic manufacturers are progressing with the implementation of more fragile dielectric insulating materials lowundefined and porous lowundefined semiconductor manufacturers continue to require more precise control over the etching process in order to accommodate decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters lam research etch products and services are defined around the 2300 ® etch series 

dielectric etch products 

  2300 ® exelan ®  2300 ® exelan ® flex™ and 2300 ® exelan ® flex45™ systems  the exelan family of dielectric etch products addresses volume manufacturing productivity requirements and enables customers to create advanced semiconductor devices the 2300 exelan flex and 2300 exelan flex45 systems extend the capability of the 2300 exelan family of products to address requirements for the 45 nm and below technology nodes these systems are based on lam research’s patented dual frequency confined tm plasma technology which enables in situ processing where multiple chemistries can be run sequentially in the same process chamber

patterning process 

during semiconductor device manufacturing lithography processes establish the templates for patterns to be created during subsequent etch processes 

patterning products 

  2300 ® motif ™ system the 2300 motif is a postlithography pattern enhancement system that enables the creation of features as small as 10 nm by using plasmabased technology to deposit a thin film on printed photoresist holes and spaces the film is created by applying multiple short etchdeposition cycles until the target feature size is achieved this capability addresses a customer technology need for a solution enabling the creation of features two to three generations ahead of lithography the system also simplifies optical proximity correction by improving the lithography profile and provides a costeffective approach to extending lithography tool sets in select applications 

clean process 

the manufacture of semiconductor devices involves a series of processes such as etch and deposition which leave particles and residues the wafer must generally be cleaned following these steps to remove residues that could degrade device performance common wafer cleaning steps include postetchpoststrip cleans and prediffusionpredeposition cleans also referred to as “critical cleans” during which the wafer surface is prepared for subsequent diffusiondeposition steps 

for 65 nm technologies and below defects transferred from the wafer edge bevel can significantly limit device yield during device patterning complex interactions of film deposition lithography etching and chemical mechanical polishing cmp result in a wide range of unstable film stacks on the wafer edge in subsequent process steps these film layers can produce defects that are transported to the device area of the wafer and residues need to be removed from the wafer edge to eliminate these defect sources 

wet clean products 

  confined chemical cleaning™ c3™ singlewafer technologybased systems at the 65 nm technology node and below devices become more susceptible to damage from the chemical environment and mechanical forces of the cleaning process lam research’s singlewafer wet cleaning system based on the company’s proprietary c3 technology provides highselectivity wafer cleaning with minimal mechanically induced damage and allows flexibility in selecting cleaning chemicals that minimize damage to device structures advanced drying technology integrated into the cleaning unit facilitates lowdefect processing of hydrophobic materials such as advanced lowundefined dielectrics short contact times enabled by an innovative chemical delivery mechanism to enhance the transport of chemicals to and from the wafer surface minimize potential erosion or etching of delicate features on the wafer while allowing for highly selective and efficient residue removal

research and development 

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to obtain and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to rd programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 were 2853 million 2294 million and 1953 million respectively the majority of spending is targeted at etch and plasmabased technology applications with an increasing proportion focused on adjacent markets pre and postetch step opportunities consistent with our multiproduct growth strategy we believe current challenges for customers in the pre and postetch applications present opportunities for us we plan to leverage our extensive production experience in etch and strip into new products and new capabilities for our customers at the 65 45 and 32 nm nodes including post ion implantation strip clean and patterning 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs support our growth strategy and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service 

our marketing sales and service efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet our customers’ needs these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions for their wafer processing needs we maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of field service engineers in place throughout the united states europe taiwan korea japan and asia pacific we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace 

we offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer the warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to our published specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired 

export sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls compliance with us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions and economic and political conditions there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows revenue by region was as follows 

 

please see note 21 “segment geographic information and major customers” to consolidated financial statements for a description of the geographic locations of longlived assets 

customers 

our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunity in fiscal year 2007 revenues from hynix semiconductor and samsung electronics company ltd each accounted for approximately 14 of total revenues in fiscal year 2006 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd accounted for approximately 15 of total revenues and revenues from toshiba corporation accounted for approximately 12 of total revenues in fiscal year 2005 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd accounted for approximately 13 of total revenues 

a material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses in turn depend on many factors including their economic capability the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes in general we schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers’ delivery requirements included in our systems backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted prices and product specifications have been agreed upon and shipment of systems is expected within one year the spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not exceeding 12 months in calculating backlog amounts 

as of june 24 2007 and june 25 2006 our backlog was approximately 643 million and 521 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes nor actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 16 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies included in our products are only obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our business we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production and cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of march 10 2008 we had approximately 3000 regular fulltime employees 

each of our employees is required to sign an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information all employees are required to sign an acknowledgement that they have read and agree to abide by a statement of standards of business conduct in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements etc our ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node provided that there is demonstrated performance to specification by the installed base accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and costefficient spare parts in the presence of thirdparty spares provider competition we face significant competition with all of our products and services certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc 

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately 1 to 20 years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they will not alone determine our success which depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k as of and for the year ended june 24 2007 the “2007 form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this 2007 form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

the results of our independent committee review of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements may continue to have adverse effects on our financial results 

the review by a special committee of our board of directors consisting of two independent board members the “independent committee” of our historical stock option practices and the resulting restatement of our historical financial statements have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses during fiscal year 2008 the resulting restatements have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations we have restated our historical results of operations to record additional noncash stockbased compensation expense of 952 million in the aggregate for the periods from fiscal 1997 to fiscal 2006 excluding the impact of related payroll and income taxes we expect to amortize less than 01 million of compensation expense under financial accounting standards no 123 revised “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” in periods subsequent to fiscal year 2006 to properly account for previously issued stock options with deemed incorrect measurement dates furthermore to address potential adverse tax consequences certain of our employees have incurred or may incur as a result of the issuance andor exercise of misdated stock options we will take remedial actions to make such employees including our chief executive officer and other affected executive officers whole for any or all such additional tax liabilities currently estimated to be in the range of approximately 50 million to 55 million such actions may cause us to incur additional cash or noncash compensation expense see the “explanatory note” immediately preceding part i item 1 and note 3 “restatements of consolidated financial statements” to notes to consolidated financial statements of this 2007 form 10k for further discussion 

we may be subject to the risks of lawsuits in connection with our historical stock option practices the resulting restatements and the remedial measures we have taken 

we and our current and former directors and officers may become the subject of government inquiries shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits and other legal proceedings relating to our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements in the future we have received a letter from a stockholder demanding that our board of directors take certain actions including potentially legal action in connection with our historical stock option practices and threatening to sue if our board of directors does not comply with the stockholder’s demands our board of directors is currently reviewing the letter we may also be subject to other kinds of lawsuits should any of these events occur they could require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses this could divert attention and resources from the operation of our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ultimate outcome of these potential actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price for our securities litigation may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict the defense of these potential lawsuits could result in significant expenditures 

subject to certain limitations we are obliged to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees in connection with any government inquiry or litigation related to our historical stock option practices that may arise we currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers although there can be no assurance that the insurance would cover all of the expenses that would be associated with any proceedings 

judgment and estimates utilized by us in determining stock option grant dates and related adjustments may be subject to change due to subsequent sec guidance or other disclosure requirements 

in determining the restatement adjustments in connection with the stock option review management used all reasonably available relevant information to form conclusions it believes are appropriate as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred the dates when such actions occurred and the determination of grant dates for financial accounting purposes based on when the requirements of the accounting standards were met we considered various alternatives throughout the course of the review and restatement and we believe the approaches used were the most appropriate and that the choices of measurement dates used in our review of stock option grant accounting and restatement of our financial statements were reasonable and appropriate in our circumstances however the sec may issue additional guidance on disclosure requirements related to the financial impact of past stock option grant measurement date errors that may require us to amend this filing or other filings with the sec to provide additional disclosures pursuant to such additional guidance any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our subsequent sec reports and delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have not been in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements if we are unable to attain compliance with or thereafter remain in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements there may be a material adverse effect on our business and our stockholders 

as a consequence of the independent committee review of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements of our financial statements we have not been able to file our periodic reports with the sec on a timely basis and continue to face the possibility of delisting of our stock from the nasdaq global select market we have now filed this 2007 form 10k and we believe that this filing together with the expected filing of the quarterly report on form 10q as of and for the quarter ended september 23 2007 the “first quarter 2008 form 10q” and the quarterly report on form 10q as of and for the quarter ended december 23 2007 the “second quarter 2008 form 10q” with the sec will remediate the company’s noncompliance with marketplace rule 4310c 14 subject to the affirmative completion by the nasdaq stock market inc “nasdaq” of its compliance protocols and its notification to the company accordingly however if nasdaq disagrees with the company’s position or if the sec disagrees with the manner in which the financial impact of past stock option grants have been accounted for and reported or not reported there could be further delays in filing subsequent sec reports or other actions that might result in delisting of the company’s common stock from the nasdaq global select market 

see the “explanatory note” immediately preceding part i item 1 and note 3 “restatements of consolidated financial statements” to consolidated financial statements of this 2007 10k for further discussion until we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements the possibility of a nasdaq delisting exists if this happens the price of our stock and the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock would be adversely affected in addition we would be subject to a number of restrictions regarding the registration of our stock under federal securities laws and we would not be able to allow our employees to exercise their outstanding options which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as a result of the delayed filings of our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarters ended september 23 2007 and december 23 2007 as well as of this 2007 form 10k we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s3 for sale by us or resale by others until one year from the date the last delinquent filing is made we may use form s1 to raise capital or complete acquisitions but doing so could increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner 

it may be difficult or more costly to obtain director and officer liability insurance coverage as a result of our stock option restatement 

the issues arising from our restatement may make it more difficult to obtain director and officer liability insurance coverage in the future if we are able to obtain this coverage it could be significantly more costly than in the past which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flow if we are unable to secure appropriate director and officer liability insurance coverage on reasonable terms our directors and officers could face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties in that event we believe we could have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified directors and officers which could adversely affect our business 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations our operating results may be adversely affected because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

 

further because a significant amount of our rd and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont california campus natural physical logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities including labor disruptions earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance 

we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of highpriced systems 

system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems can typically range in price up to approximately 6 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems as a result the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter 

variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably 

fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our financial results 

we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products moreover future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of these products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

in addition the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products as well this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment our business is affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps this might have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue new orders and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

strategic alliances may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies often one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while this could work to our advantage if lam research’s equipment becomes the basis for the function or process it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process in the latter case even if lam research’s equipment was previously used by a customer that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance 

similarly our customers may team with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines these actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business 

we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers 

we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we have established longterm contracts with many of these suppliers these longterm contracts can take a variety of forms we may renew these contracts periodically in some cases these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers however several of our suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships 

our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 

outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business 

in addition the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships andor have a negative effect on our operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment 

we are subject to risks associated with our competitors’ strategic relationships and their introduction of new products and we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share 

we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently or expect to offer they may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 84 in fiscal year 2007 86 in fiscal year 2006 and 84 in fiscal year 2005 of our total revenue we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations and international sales are subject to risks including but not limited to 

 

 

certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between china taiwan japan and the united states political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with china andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues in japan that are denominated in japanese yen certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency 

we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated assets and forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over or underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging our yendenominated assets with currency forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we currently do not enter into such forward contracts for currencies other than the yen and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in other currencies 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws or by material audit assessments which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

if we are unable to adjust the scale of our business in response to rapid changes in demand in the semiconductor equipment industry our operating results and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired 

the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures and in training managing and appropriately sizing our supply chain our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively if we do not adequately meet these challenges our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies such as our march 2008 acquisition of sez holding ag or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups 

diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others we anticipate that our recent acquisition of sez will give rise to risks like these as we integrate its operations with ours there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors including but not limited to the following 

 

in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our common stock 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment to the extent that these information systems are under our control we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to address the outlined risks however security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam research in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results moreover although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur 

we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights which could affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise continuing our development of new systems increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers however we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications in addition the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages 

we are subject to the internal control evaluation and attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year furthermore our independent registered public accounting firm the “independent registered public accounting firm” or the “firm” is required to report on whether it believes we maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year we have successfully completed our assessment and obtained our independent registered public accounting firm’s attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 24 2007 in future years if we fail to timely complete this assessment or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our assessment we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control in addition any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations 

our independent registered public accounting firm must confirm its independence in order for us to meet our regulatory reporting obligations on a timely basis 

our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the firm and lam research that in the firm’s professional judgment might have a bearing on the firm’s independence with respect to us if for whatever reason our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of lam research based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements which are subject to risks uncertainties and changes in condition significance value and effect our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in “risk factors” and elsewhere in this 2007 form 10k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission see “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” in part i of this 2007 form 10k  

the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions generally and in the semiconductor industry supply demand and prices for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results

on july 18 2007 the company announced that its board of directors had initiated a voluntary independent review regarding the timing of and accounting for the company’s past stock option grants and other related issues the voluntary internal review arose after the company’s independent registered public accounting firm performed auditing procedures relating to the company’s historical stock option grant programs and procedures as part of the firm’s fiscal yearend 2007 audit the board of directors appointed a special committee consisting of two independent board members the “independent committee” to conduct a comprehensive review of the company’s historical stock option practices the independent committee promptly engaged independent outside legal counsel and forensic accountants to assist with the review on december 21 2007 the company announced that the independent committee had reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differed from the recorded grant dates of such awards upon the recommendation of management and the independent committee the audit committee of the board of directors concluded that the financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2005 and the interim periods contained therein should no longer be relied upon the independent committee’s review was completed in february 2008 

scope of the independent committee review 

the review covered stock option grants awarded in fiscal years 1997 through 2005 the “review period” the scope of the review included evaluating 100 of “companywide” grants director grants section 16 officer grants and new hire grants as well as a sampling of grants deemed “other grants” representing approximately 94 of all stock option grants during the review period this review period comprised approximately 16000 separate stock option grants on approximately 500 separately recorded grant dates these grants involved approximately 58 million underlying shares of common stock and included grants to domestic and international employees share amount have been adjusted as applicable to reflect the march 2000 3for1 stock split the independent committee’s review also included procedures to identify potential modifications of stock option grants and grants awarded to consultants and testing of cash exercises the company had not awarded any companywide stock option grants since october 2002 and stopped issuing stock option grants during fiscal year 2005 and only issued restricted stock units “rsus” thereafter the independent committee did not include fiscal years 2006 and 2007 in the scope of its review based on several factors including but not limited to the fact that the company only issued rsus after fiscal year 2005 and the company’s equity granting processes and controls had been documented and tested as part of its assessment of the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 additionally no information arose during the stock option review that would indicate a need to expand the scope of the review to include other periods 

the independent committee’s review included the collection and processing of over 35 million electronic documents which included hard drives and network share drives of numerous individuals the company’s network servers and backup tapes the independent committee’s advisors also collected and reviewed hard copy documents from numerous sources and conducted 61 interviews of 47 individuals predominantly current or former directors officers and employees of the company 

stock option review results 

consistent with applicable accounting literature and guidance from the sec staff the company organized the grants during the review period into categories based on the grant type and the process by which the grant was finalized the company analyzed the evidence from the independent committee’s review related to each category including but not limited to physical documents electronic documents and underlying electronic data about documents based on the relevant facts and circumstances the company applied the applicable accounting standards to determine for grants within each category the proper measurement date if the measurement date was not the originally recorded grant date accounting adjustments were made as required in some cases resulting in stockbased compensation expense and related tax effects the significant majority of the measurement date changes result from stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2003 as a result of the findings of the review the company has recognized incremental stockbased compensation and associated payroll tax expense of 964 million on a pretax basis 658 million after taxes in the aggregate during fiscal years 1997 through 2006 which includes incremental stockbased compensation expense of 12 million recognized in accordance with sfas no 123r during fiscal year 2006 

the independent committee also concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part of company management or the company’s independent directors during its review of the company’s historical stock option practices the independent committee did not find evidence of any other financial reporting or accounting issues unrelated to stockbased compensation 

  companywide grants 

companywide grants were awarded on ten dates during the review period and are associated with approximately half of the shares underlying option grants encompassed in the review these ten dates include grants issued on six dates for broadbased and primarily discretionary grants “focal grants” two grant dates that were formulabased grants “supplemental grants” and two grant dates designed to address certain previously granted stock options for which the exercise price was higher than the thencurrent fair value of the company’s common stock “cancel and replace grants” as a result of its review the company determined that the actual measurement dates for certain stock option grants differed from the recorded grant dates the company determined that the actual measurement date meaning when the required actions necessary to grant the option were completed including the determination of the number of shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price was the correct measurement date to determine what if any stockbased compensation was appropriate any intrinsic value of the options on the measurement date measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and the market price has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were providing services in exchange for the options 

with respect to the focal grants the company concluded that a process to determine the total number of shares underlying the options grant date and exercise price generally commenced prior to the recorded grant date but that in certain cases the specific allocation of those shares among the various option recipients was not finalized until after the original recorded grant date to address these circumstances the company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these option grants to a date after the original grant date when the allocation of the shares was first known to be finalized the company has recognized stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures of 612 million on a pretax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates 

with respect to the supplemental grants the company determined that the general formula for determining the number of shares underlying the option grant to which each recipient would be entitled was not sufficiently finalized for accounting purposes at the original recorded grant date to address these circumstances the company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the date when this formula was first known to be finalized the company has recognized stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures of 56 million on a pretax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates 

the cancel and replace grants involved recipients electing to exchange certain stock options for which the exercise price was higher than the thencurrent fair value of the company’s common stock in return for a new grant of options the company determined that in both instances the election deadline was after the recorded grant date the measurement date should have been the later of the recorded grant date or the date of election because the elections were revocable up to the last day of the offer period to address these circumstances the company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the last possible date of election the company has recognized stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures of 02 million on a pretax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates 

  grants to directors and section 16 officers 

director grants were awarded on ten dates during the stock option review period grants to directors were typically governed by the requirements of the underlying stock option plan documents as grant dates and amounts were typically fixed by the respective stock option plan there were instances when the grant dates were not consistent with dates fixed by the respective stock option plan in all instances the grant date was within 1 to 3 days of the dates provided by the plan to address these circumstances the company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the date as required by the stock option plan the company has recognized stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures of 28 million on a pretax basis as a result of the revised measurement dates 

section 16 officer grants were awarded on 23 grant dates during the stock option review period the company determined that the actual measurement date meaning when the required actions necessary to grant the option were completed including the determination of the number of shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price was the correct measurement date to determine the market price of the option shares any intrinsic value of the options on the measurement date measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and the market price has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were providing services in exchange for the options in instances where the original recorded grant date was not consistent with the correct measurement date the company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date when the number of shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first known to be finalized the company has recognized stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures of 10 million on a pretax basis as a result of the revised measurement dates additionally it was determined that for one grant the recorded grant price was based on an average of closing prices of the company’s stock immediately prior to the grant date the option plan under which this option was granted allowed for similar pricing to address this circumstance the company has recognized stockbased compensation expense of 21 million on a pretax basis for this grant which was equal to the difference between the closing price of the stock on the date of grant and the originally recorded grant exercise price 

  grants to consultant 

the company concluded that six granting actions to a nonemployee consultant were incorrectly accounted for as employee as opposed to nonemployee stock awards to address this circumstance the company has recognized a stockbased compensation expense of 32 million on a pretax basis under “fair value” accounting in accordance with the requirements of eitf issue no 9618 “accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services” 

  grants to new hires 

new hire grants were generally approved prior to the employee’s hire date and granted as of the last day of the month of hire prior to calendar year 1999 and on the first day of the individual’s employment with the company beginning in calendar year 1999 in instances where approval was not evidenced on or before the original recorded grant date the company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date when the required approval was first evidenced but not before the employee’s hire date the company has recognized stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures of 17 million on a pretax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates 

  other grants 

for the remaining population reviewed of stock options granted during the stock option review period the company has concluded that certain actual measurement dates differed from the recorded grant dates primarily due to a lack of contemporaneous documentation evidencing approval as of the original recorded grant date in these circumstances the company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date when the shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first known to be finalized the primary issue with these grants was that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the specific allocation of those shares among the various grant recipients was finalized at the original recorded grant date to address these circumstances the company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date when the allocation of the shares underlying the options and exercise price was first known to be finalized the company has recognized stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures of 82 million on a pretax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates 

deemed modifications to stock option grants connected with terminations or leaves of absences 

compensation expense was also recognized as a result of deemed modifications to certain employee stock option grant awards in connection with certain employees’ terminations or leaves of absence typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in additional shares in relation to a leave of absence or subsequent to their termination thus triggering a new measurement date under the accounting literature applicable at that time the company has recognized stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures of 92 million on a pretax basis as a result of these new measurement dates 

  use of judgment 

the company evaluated all available evidence for each individual grant within the scope of the independent review and the revised measurement dates represent the earliest date when the terms of the options granted to individual recipients were known with finality the proposed measurement date for certain grants could not be determined with certainty based on available evidence in light of the judgment used in establishing the measurement dates alternate approaches to those used by the company could have resulted in different stockbased compensation expense than that recorded by the company in the restatements while the company has considered these alternative approaches it believes its approach is the most appropriate under the circumstances 

the company prepared a sensitivity analysis to determine the hypothetical minimum and maximum compensation expense charge that it might have recorded for these grants if it had used different judgments to determine the revised measurement dates the company applied its sensitivity methodology on a grant date by grant date basis to examine the largest hypothetical variations in stockbased compensation expense within a reasonable range of possible measurement dates for each grant event 

after developing the range for each grant event included in the company’s sensitivity analysis the company selected the highest and lowest closing sale price of its common stock within the date range to determine the range of potential compensation expense adjustments for the grants the company then compared these aggregated amounts to the stockbased compensation expense that it recorded for the stock option grants analyzed if the company had used the highest closing sale price of its common stock within the date range for these grant events its stockbased compensation expense adjustment relating to these grants would have increased net of forfeitures by approximately 30 million on a pretax basis conversely had the company used the lowest closing sale price of its common stock within the date range for the grants analyzed its stockbased compensation expense adjustment relating to these grants would have decreased net of forfeitures by approximately 26 million on a pretax basis substantially all of the hypothetical increases or decreases of stockbased compensation expense resulting from the company’s sensitivity analysis relates to periods prior to fiscal 2005 

findings and recommendations of the independent committee 

as a result of its review the independent committee identified certain deficiencies relating to the company’s historical practices and accounting with respect to stock options including the following areas 

 

as a result of the deficiencies identified the independent committee developed recommendations targeted at strengthening the company’s processes with respect to equity compensation and relating accounting these recommendations were presented to the board of directors on february 1 2008 and include the areas of approval authority for equity compensation awards oversight and administration of the awards process coordination among relevant departments training with respect to equity compensation and recordkeeping the company is currently reviewing all of the independent committee’s recommendations as well as a potential timetable for implementation but the company believes that the substance of many of the recommendations of the independent committee have already been incorporated into the company’s current equity compensation processes this belief is consistent with the determination by the independent committee and the company that the granting of rsus after fiscal year 2005 was not within the scope of the independent committee review in part due to the documentation and testing required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the independent committee concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part of company management or the company’s independent directors 

effect of restatement on consolidated financial statements 

the company previously applied accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” through its fiscal year ended june 26 2005 under apb opinion no 25 a noncash stockbased compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual measurement date because certain of the company’s options were assessed as having an exercise price below the market price on the actual measurement date based on the company’s revised measurement dates as a result of the stock option review as more fully described above there is a noncash deferred compensation charge for each of these options under apb opinion no 25 equal to the number of shares underlying the options multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual measurement date that deferred compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period of the option the company also recorded compensation expense under “fair value” accounting when applicable for example for the grants to the nonemployee consultant noted above 

commencing in its fiscal year ended june 25 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” as a result beginning in fiscal year 2006 the additional stockbased compensation expense required to be recorded for each option with a revised measurement date as more fully described above is equal to the fair value of the option on revised measurement date amortized over the remaining service period of the option the company did not record these stockbased compensation expenses under apb opinion no 25 nor sfas no 123r related to its options based on the revised measurement dates in the company’s previously issued financial statements and that is why the company is restating them in this filing the company restated its historical results of operations to record additional pretax noncash stockbased compensation expense of a 940 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 1997 through june 26 2005 under apb opinion no 25 and other applicable accounting rules and b 12 million for the year ended june 25 2006 under sfas no 123r as of june 25 2006 there was less than 01 million of remaining compensation expense to be recorded under sfas no 123r for stock options with revised measurement dates in addition the company recorded pretax payroll related tax expenses of 12 million through june 25 2006 

diluted shares in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 also increased as a result of the adjustments for stock options with revised measurement dates the company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the weightedaverage shares used in the diluted eps calculation as part of the restatement the company revised its treasury stock calculations in accordance with sfas no 128 “earnings per share” these calculations assume that i all dilutive options with revised measurement dates are exercised ii the company repurchases shares with the proceeds of these hypothetical exercises along with the tax benefit resulting from the hypothetical exercises and iii any average unamortized deferred stockbased compensation is also used to repurchase shares 

as described for each element above the company evaluated the impact of the restatements on its global tax provision as a result we recorded a cumulative tax benefit of 306 million through june 25 2006 the company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world in certain jurisdictions including but not limited to the united states the company is able to claim a tax deduction relative to stock options in those jurisdictions where a tax deduction is claimed the company has recorded deferred tax assets totaling 62 million at june 25 2006 to reflect future tax deductions to the extent the company believes such assets to be recoverable based on this review the company now believes that it should not have taken a united states tax deduction in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives under internal revenue code irc section 162m section 162m limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds as a result the company’s tax carryforward attributes have decreased by approximately 146 million as of june 25 2006 

for those stock option grants determined to have incorrect measurement dates for accounting purposes and that had been originally issued as incentive stock options or isos the company recorded a liability for payroll tax contingencies in the event such grants would not be respected as isos under the principles of the irc and the regulations therein the company recorded expense and accrued liabilities for certain foreign payroll tax contingencies the total payroll tax accrual was approximately 12 million for annual periods from our fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2006 this cumulative expense resulted from payroll tax expense recorded in prior periods has been partially offset by benefits relating to the expiration of the related statute of limitations 

as a result of the restatement the cumulative effect of the related aftertax expenses for the fiscal years ended june 30 1997 through june 25 2006 was 658 million as compared to 964 million in pretax charges as previously discussed these additional stockbased compensation and other expenses had no effect on the company’s reported revenue cash cash equivalents or shortterm investments for each of the restated periods the company has also restated the pro forma amortization of deferred stockbased employee compensation included in reported net income net of tax and total stockbased employee compensation expenses determined under fair value based method net of tax under sfas no 123 in note 14 “equitybased compensation plans” to consolidated financial statements to reflect the effect of the stockbased compensation expense resulting from the correction of these past stock option grants 

as a result of the determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review the company considered the application of section 409a of the irc to certain stock option grants where under apb no 25 intrinsic value existed at the time of grant in the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the irc and applicable regulations thereunder these options are subject to section 409a on march 30 2008 the board of directors of the company authorized the company to assume the liability of any and all employees including the company’s chief executive officer and certain executive officers with options subject to section 409a the liability is currently estimated to be in the range of approximately 50 million to 55 million the determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in note 3 “restatement of consolidated financial statements” to consolidated financial statements in item 8 and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of the company’s 2007 form 10k 

the financial statement effect of the restatement of stockbased compensation expense and related payroll and income taxes by year is as follows in thousands 

 

the financial statement effect of the restatement on previously reported stockbased compensation expense including income tax effect by year is as follows in thousands 

 

as a result of these adjustments the company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as of june 25 2006 and for each of the two years in the period ended june 25 2006 have been restated the company also recorded adjustments affecting previouslyreported financial statements for fiscal years 1996 through 2004 the effects of which are summarized in cumulative adjustments to additional paidin capital deferred stockbased compensation and retained earnings as of june 27 2004 

late sec filings and nasdaq delisting proceedings 

on august 27 2007 the company received a nasdaq staff determination letter stating that as a result of the delayed filing of its 2007 form 10k the company was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in marketplace rule 4310c14 and was therefore subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market on november 7 2007 the company received an additional letter from nasdaq of similar substance related to its first quarter 2008 form 10q on january 14 2008 the nasdaq listing qualifications panel granted the company’s request for continued listing provided that it filed a written summary of the independent committee’s findings with nasdaq as well as the 2007 form 10k and first quarter 2008 form 10q on or before february 13 2007 on february 5 2008 the company received an additional letter from nasdaq stating that as a result of the delayed filing of its second quarter 2008 form 10q the company was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in marketplace rule 4310c14 and was therefore subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market on february 8 2008 the company received a notice from the nasdaq listing and hearings review council that advised the company that any delisting determination by the nasdaq listing qualifications panel had been stayed pending further review by the review council the company was given until march 28 2008 to submit additional information to assist the review council in its assessment of the company’s listing status on february 12 2008 the company filed a written summary of the independent committee’s findings with nasdaq the company believes that the filing of this 2007 form 10k together with the expected filing of the first quarter 2008 form 10q and the second quarter 2008 form 10q with the sec will remediate the company’s noncompliance with marketplace rule 4310c14 subject to nasdaq’s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to the company accordingly however if nasdaq disagrees with the company’s position or if the sec disagrees with the manner in which the financial effect of past stock option grants have been accounted for and reported or not reported there could be further delays in filing subsequent sec reports or other actions that might result in delisting of the company’s common stock from the nasdaq global select market 

costs of restatement and legal activities 

during the first two quarters of fiscal year 2008 the company incurred expenses totaling approximately 95 million for legal accounting tax and other professional services in connection with the independent committee’s review the company’s own internal review and recertification procedures the preparation of the june 24 2007 consolidated financial statements and the restated consolidated financial statements there were no such expenses incurred as a result of the stock option review during fiscal year 2007 

shareholder litigation relating to historical stock option practices 

we and our current and former directors and officers may become the subject of government inquiries shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits and other legal proceedings relating to our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements in the future we have received a letter from a stockholder demanding that our board of directors take certain actions including potentially legal action in connection with our historical stock option practices and threatening to sue if our board of directors does not comply with the stockholder’s demands our board of directors is currently reviewing the letter we may also be subject to other kinds of lawsuits should any of these events occur they could require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses this could divert attention and resources from the operation of our business and adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ultimate outcome of these potential actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price for our securities litigation may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict the defense of these potential lawsuits could result in significant expenditures 

executive summary 

we design manufacture market and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits we leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated processing solutions that typically benefit our customers through reduced cost lower defect rates enhanced yields or faster processing time 

the following summarizes certain key quarterly and annual financial information for the periods indicated below in thousands except per share data and percentages and demonstrates the strength of our performance throughout fiscal year 2007 

 

our demonstrated performance and our business model which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers enables us to focus on new and existing product development sales and marketing and customer support we are executing to the nearterm production requirements of our customers targeted to expand our leadership position in etch leverage our etch expertise into adjacent markets and meet our objective of delivering bestinclass financial performance over the long term 

fiscal year 2007 shipments were approximately 26 billion fiscal year 2007 revenues increased 56 compared to fiscal year 2006 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market with positive revenue momentum in all regions 

gross margin as a percent of revenues remained greater than 50 for the third consecutive year and increased sequentially to 508 compared to fiscal year 2006 gross margin of 504 

our fiscal 2007 performance is demonstrated by the significant increase in operating margin to 303 compared with 246 in fiscal year 2006 a sequential increase of 92 compared to the 56 growth in revenue total operating expenses increased 25 during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 driven by discretionary investments related to our multiproduct and adjacent market expansion plans these investments included increased compensation costs as we expanded our headcount to support our growth plans during fiscal year 2007 by more than 20 to approximately 2900 employees incentivebased compensation levels grew consistent with our strong performance in profitability and share price we also invested in discretionary spending on supplies and materials to support our new product development and customer evaluation activities 

equitybased compensation expense recognized during fiscal year 2007 in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was 64 million and 291 million respectively compared to 54 million and 186 million respectively in the prior year the fiscal year 2007 increase reflects the addition of our 2007 restricted stock unit focal grant which was awarded at a higher stock price than the prior year focal grant 

worthy of note is the growth in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal year 2007 which more than doubled from fiscal year 2006 performance to 8236 million representing approximately 32 of revenues an increase of 1242 sequentially 

results of operations 

shipments and backlog 

 

during fiscal year 2007 300 mm applications represented approximately 88 of total etch systems shipments and 94 of etch systems shipments were for applications at less than or equal to the 90 nm technology node we classify total etch systems shipments market segmentation for fiscal year 2007 as memory at approximately 73 foundry at 15 and idm logicother at 12 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 24 2007 were approximately 6426 million the basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this 2007 form 10k for additional information on our backlog policy 

revenue 

 

the increase in revenues during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers and our market share expansion we believe we gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market over this period with strong revenue performance in taiwan china north america and korea during fiscal year 2007 and in japan and korea during fiscal year 2006 the increase in revenues was correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines the overall asia region continued to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in that region our deferred revenue balance increased to 2955 million as of june 24 2007 compared to 2297 million as of june 25 2006 as shipments outpaced revenues during fiscal year 2007 the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately 51 million as of june 24 2007 these shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers 

gross margin 

 

 

 gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2007 remained greater than 50 for the third consecutive year and increased sequentially to 508 for fiscal year 2007 the increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006 was primarily driven by improved utilization of factory and field resources on higher business volumes partially offset by product and customer mix and implementation of a targeted consumable spare parts pricereduction strategy focused on preserving and building market share and strengthening customer trust in our efforts to support their costreduction roadmaps 

the decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2006 compared with fiscal year 2005 was affected by the inclusion of equitybased compensation as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r of 5 million or 03 the impact of unfavorable product mix was generally offset by improved installation and warranty performance and improved factory utilization which was facilitated by higher volumes 

research and development 

 

1 see note 3 “ restatements of consolidated financial statements ” to consolidated financial statements 

we continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leadingedge plasma etch and our portfolio of new products the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 included expected increases of approximately 22 million in engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch new and product growth objectives 18 million in salary and benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation supporting that same strategy 6 million in incentivebased compensation driven by higher profit levels and 6 million in equitybased compensation approximately 33 of fiscal year 2007 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years 

the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to approximately 19 million in increased supplies and outside services 8 million in increased equitybased compensation expense and 4 million in increased salary and benefit costs due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount 

selling general and administrative 

 

1 see note 3 “ restatements of consolidated financial statements ” to consolidated financial statements 

the increase in sga expenses during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year was driven by increases of 20 million in incentivebased compensation triggered by higher profits and stock price approximately 15 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation and 5 million in equitybased compensation 

the increase in sga expenses during fiscal year 2006 compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately 4 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount increases in incentivebased cash compensation of approximately 7 million were principally due to our longterm executive compensation program implemented during fiscal year 2006 and equitybased compensation was approximately 8 million fiscal year 2005 sga expenses were lower primarily due to the march 2005 receipt of an 8 million tax refund from the california state board of equalization for previously paid sales and use tax 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 

 

the increase in interest income during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year is primarily due to increases in our average balances of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2007 and to a lesser extent increases in interest rate yields although the average total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances increased throughout the year the balances at the end of fiscal year 2007 decreased by approximately 490 million compared to the prior year primarily due to share repurchase activity of approximately 11 billion throughout fiscal year 2007 of which approximately 768 million occurred during the june 2007 quarter 

the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2007 was due to the 350 million of longterm debt entered into by our whollyowned subsidiary on june 16 2006 to facilitate the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca the balance of our longterm debt was 250 million as of june 24 2007 

in june 2007 we recognized a gain of 30 million related to the sale of a private equity investment 

the favorable legal judgment of 158 million during fiscal year 2007 was obtained in a lawsuit filed by the company alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of its customers the supreme court of california denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of lam research during the quarter ended september 24 2006 

the sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents shortterm securities and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate yields the company’s total balances of cash cash equivalents shortterm securities and restricted cash and investments increased approximately 626 million from fiscal year 2005 this increase included the company’s whollyowned subsidiary’s drawdown against a 350 million credit agreement to support the company’s foreign earnings repatriation of 500 million under the ajca the remaining increase of 276 million was primarily driven by 367 million from cash flows from operating activities 

income tax expense 

our annual income tax expense was 1619 million 1046 million and 990 million in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 was 191 238 and 250 respectively the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2007 was due to the change in the geographical mix of income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate as well as certain discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of 215 million or 25 benefit on the effective tax rate these discrete events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of the company’s us and certain foreign income tax returns the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now settled and an increased benefit related to the extension of the federal research credit as it pertains to the company’s fiscal year 2006 these favorable adjustments were partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to the application of foreign tax rulings 

the fiscal year 2006 effective tax rate was 238 compared to the fiscal year 2005 effective tax rate of 250 and reflects the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate the realization of state rd tax credits not previously benefited favorable tax rulings on prior year tax returns filed and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to the agreement of a bilateral advanced pricing arrangement these favorable adjustments for the year were partially offset by a discrete event for the repatriation during fiscal year 2006 of a 500 million extraordinary dividend under the american jobs creation act of 2004 combined with the impact of the accounting for equitybased awards in accordance with sfas no 123r and the deductibility of those awards in some jurisdictions and the expiration of the research tax credit on december 31 2005 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes our gross deferred tax assets primarily comprised of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards were 1233 million and 1333 million at the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 342 million and 271 million at the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively 

deferred tax assets decreased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the utilization of tax credits adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of income tax returns in various jurisdictions the impact of certain elections related to foreign tax rulings the conclusion of negotiations on certain transfer pricing items and the incremental tax benefit related to stockbased compensation deductions 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances if any 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have completed our system installation obligations received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreedto customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations revenue from multipleelement arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values provided the elements have value on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract 

  inventory valuation  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale when the terms of sale do not specify we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance 

standard costs are reassessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts currently obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels methods of manufacturing and overhead for internally manufactured products manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period generally obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 

  warranty  typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer when appropriate we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability trends all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping 

actual warranty expenses are incurred on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 

  equitybased compensation — employee stock purchase plan and employee stock plans  we account for our employee stock purchase plan espp and stock plans under the provisions of sfas no 123r sfas no 123r requires the recognition of the fair value of equitybased compensation in net income the fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant the fair value of our stock options and espp awards was estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing sfas no 123r including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award the fair value of equitybased awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straightline method for awards granted after the adoption of sfas no 123r and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r 

we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r we will only recognize a benefit from stockbased compensation in paidincapital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized in addition we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stockbased compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the income statement continuing operations rather than through paidincapital we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under apb no 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paidincapital in accordance with footnote 82 of sfas no 123r 

in connection with our restatement of the consolidated financial statements we have applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates and if revised which measurement date to select for prior option grants information regarding the restatement is set forth above in “restatement of previously issued financial statements” and in note 3 “restatement of consolidated financial statements” in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k 

  income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 

we provide for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the company the level of rd spending the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed we carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate if necessary if actual results differ from estimates we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the company’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s results of operation and financial condition the company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” 

  goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 142 sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually sfas no 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review goodwill for impairment at least annually in addition we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation number 48 “accounting for income tax uncertainties” fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we will adopt fin 48 as of june 25 2007 as a result of the adoption of fin 48 we expect to decrease the recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 262 million as well as reclass approximately 644 million from current to noncurrent income taxes payable we expect the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 to be a 176 million increase to our opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 

in september 2006 the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” sab 108 sab 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year’s financial statements are materially misstated we applied the provisions of sab 108 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 which defines fair value establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements sfas no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 earlier adoption is permitted provided the company has not yet issued financial statements including interim periods for that fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact if any of adopting the provisions of sfas no 157 on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas no 159 this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas no 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 157 we expect to adopt sfas no 159 beginning june 30 2008 and are currently evaluating the impact that this pronouncement may have on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” sfas no 141r sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas no 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after december 15 2008 we expect to adopt sfas no 141r beginning in fiscal year 2010 and are currently evaluating the potential impact if any of the adoption of sfas no 141r on our consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of june 24 2007 we had approximately 10 billion in gross cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments compared with 15 billion at june 25 2006 during fiscal year 2007 we generated 8236 million in cash from operating activities which supported the use of 11 billion in stock repurchases 1771 million to fund the acquisition of the silicon growing and silicon fabrication assets of bullen ultrasonics inc bullen and 1000 million repayment of our longterm debt 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 8236 million during fiscal year 2007 consisted of in millions 

 

significant changes in assets and liabilities included increases in deferred profit of 511 million due to increased volume of shipments 448 million in accrued expenses primarily due to increased incentivebased compensation on higher profit levels and an increase in accounts payable of 91 million these amounts were partially offset by an increase in inventories of 563 million on increased business volume an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 192 million on a pretax basis due to certain supply arrangement and taxes receivable 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2007 was 828 million and included the acquisition of bullen assets of 1771 million and capital expenditures of 600 million partially offset by the reclassification of 1100 million from restricted cash and investments due to the repayment of 1000 million of our longterm debt and 452 million in net sales of shortterm investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2007 was 11 billion in total reflecting 11 billion of stock repurchases thereby completing all available share repurchase authorizations we also made payments on our longterm debt and capital leases of 1002 million partially offsetting these uses of cash were 606 million from the issuance of our common stock related to employee equitybased plans and 450 million of excess tax benefit on equitybased compensation plans which represents the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized 

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based upon our current business outlook our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 24 2007 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products should additional funding be required we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that in the event of such requirements we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not to make future payments under various contracts obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include our longterm debt which is outlined in the following table and discussed below our offbalance sheet arrangements include certain contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below our combined contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table as of june 24 2007

subsequent events 

  sez transaction  on march 11 2008 we completed the tender offer for the outstanding shares of sez holding ag “sez” the leading supplier of singlewafer clean technology and products to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry upon the completion of the tender we acquired approximately 94 of the outstanding shares of sez we expect to take additional steps as necessary to acquire the sez shares that remain outstanding 

the tender offer was conducted pursuant to the terms of a transaction agreement entered into on december 10 2007 by and between the company and sez the “transaction agreement” under the terms of the transaction agreement we acquired all shares of sez that were tendered in the offer at a price of chf 38 per share in cash for a total price of chf 606 million which approximated us584 million

  operating leases  on december 18 2007 we entered into a series of two operating leases the “livermore leases” regarding certain improved properties in livermore california on december 21 2007 we entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases the “new fremont leases” and collectively with the livermore leases the “operating leases” with regard to certain improved properties at our headquarters in fremont california each of the operating leases is an offbalance sheet arrangement 

the operating leases and associated documents for each operating lease were entered into by us and bnp paribas leasing corporation “bnpplc” 

each livermore lease facility has an approximately sevenyear term inclusive of an initial construction period during which bnpplc’s and our obligations will be governed by the construction agreement entered into with regard to such livermore lease facility ending on the first business day in january 2015 total scheduled rent payments under the livermore leases are estimated to be approximately 257 million in the aggregate based on onemonth libor rates at the time of entering into the leases following completion of improvements to each property 

each new fremont lease has an approximately sevenyear term ending on the first business day in january 2015 total scheduled rent payments under the new fremont leases are approximately 324 million in the aggregate based upon threemonth libor rates at the time of entering into the leases

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate longterm debt we target to maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk the table below presents principal amounts and related weightedaverage tax equivalent interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at june 24 2007 and june 25 2006 

 

the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of june 24 2007 are as follows 

 

we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues in japan that are denominated in japanese yen certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated assets and forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted japanese yendenominated revenues we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of japanese yendenominated net receivable balances the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables recorded in other income and expense assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 

on june 24 2007 the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was 302 million the unrealized gain on the contracts on june 24 2007 was 01 million as of june 24 2007 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent and 15 percent in the japanese yen would result in a potential loss in fair value of our balance sheet hedge forward contracts of 30 million and 45 million respectively these changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances on june 24 2007 the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was 776 million as of june 24 2007 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent and 15 percent in the japanese yen would result in a potential loss in fair value of our cash flow hedge forward contracts of 78 million and 116 million respectively 

our outstanding longterm debt of 2500 million bears interest at libor plus a spread ranging from 010 to 050 depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the lri credit agreement the initial spread under the lri credit agreement is 010 the principal payment of 250 million is due on june 19 2011 the fair value of longterm debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt please see additional information under “subsequent events” regarding termination of the lri credit agreement and our entry into a new credit agreement

findings and recommendations of the independent committee 

as a result of its review the independent committee identified certain deficiencies relating to the company’s historical practices and accounting with respect to stock options the deficiencies identified include the following areas 

 

as a result of the deficiencies identified the independent committee developed recommendations targeted at strengthening the company’s processes with respect to equity compensation and relating accounting these recommendations were presented to the board of directors on february 1 2008 and include the areas of approval authority for equity compensation awards oversight and administration of the awards process coordination among relevant departments training with respect to equity compensation and recordkeeping the company is currently reviewing all of the independent committee’s recommendations as well as a potential timetable for implementation but the company believes that the substance of many of the recommendations of the independent committee have already been incorporated into the company’s current equity compensation processes this belief is consistent with the determination by the independent committee and the company that the granting of rsus after fiscal year 2005 was not within the scope of the independent committee review in part due to the documentation and testing required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

the independent committee concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part of company management or the company’s independent directors 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by exchange act rule 13a15b as of june 24 2007 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer along with our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control—integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 24 2007 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included in part iv item 15 of this 2007 form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met

this compensation discussion and analysis cda discusses our compensation program for the period including fiscal year 2007 and covers actions regarding executive compensation that were taken through march 21 2008 for our executive officers listed below the “named executive officers” whose compensation is detailed in the tables below 

 

 

 cda consists of the following sections

philosophy  objectives explains the philosophy and objectives of our compensation program 

executive compensation program components and process explains the major elements of our compensation program as well as the process by which the compensation of our executive officers is determined 

peer group identifies the peer group to which we compare our compensation program 

base salary annual incentive awards and multiyear cashbased incentive program myip each explain a major element of our compensation program 

equity incentive compensation explains the role of equity incentive awards in our compensation program 

compensation of chief executive officer and compensation of executive chairman summarizes the employment agreements that we have with our chief executive officer and our executive chairman 

change in control and severance arrangements explains the role of such arrangements in our compensation program

medical and dental insurance retirement benefit summarizes this element of our compensation program 

executive stock ownership guidelines sets forth the stock ownership guidelines that we have adopted for our executive officers 

accounting and tax considerations explain the accounting and tax matters that we consider when setting compensation 

this cda discusses our executive compensation in the context of a calendar year because our compensation program is designed and evaluated on a calendar year basis rather than a fiscal year basis however as required by applicable sec rules the compensation tables that follow this cda report the executive compensation payments and awards made during fiscal 2007 

philosophy and objectives 

lam research’s compensation program is designed and evaluated on a calendar year basis rather than a fiscal year basis because the company’s business planning performance goal setting pay and benefit cycles are all run on a calendar year the principal objectives of our compensation program are to 

 

in formulating and administering the individual elements of our executive compensation program we focus on 

 

within this framework the committee reviews the information analysis and compensation proposals provided by management and meets with our executive chairman senior management and specialists from human resources finance and legal management makes recommendations to the committee on the base salary annual incentive award targets and longterm incentive compensation for the named executive officers the committee considers management’s recommendations with respect to executive compensation in light of competitive compensation data and relevant business objectives at the request of the committee the executive chairman discusses management’s compensation recommendations with the committee the committee also regularly holds executive sessions not attended by any members of management the committee makes recommendations to the independent members of our board of directors on the compensation of our chief executive officer for the final determination and approval by such members of our board of directors 

executive compensation program components and process 

components  lam research’s executive compensation program consists of the major components listed in the table below we consider each element to be appropriate to meet one or more of the principal objectives of our compensation policy we generally target compensation near the 50 th percentile of our peer group yet allow our executives the ability to achieve higher levels of compensation up to and above the 75 th percentile of our peer group if warranted by superior company and individual performance furthermore we also consider factors such as job performance job scope and responsibilities skill set prior experience the executive’s time in his or her position with lam research internal consistency regarding pay levels for similar positions or skill levels within the company external pressures to attract and retain talent and market conditions generally in general pay differentials between our executive officers reflect these factors and we believe are consistent with pay differentials between similar positions at our peer companies 

 

we also have included severance provisions in employment agreements we have entered into with messrs bagley newberry and bright these employment agreements are described in more detail below as well as in the “potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol” section below we typically do not offer severance provisions in our agreements with executive officers but we retain the flexibility to do so on an individual basis for recruitment and retention purposes and in order to provide a period during which a former executive is incentivized not to engage in competitive activities 

process generally at the beginning of each calendar year the committee reviews base salaries annual incentives and longterm incentives and revises the overall compensation package from time to time when appropriate in light of lam research’s current business strategies and performance and changes in regulatory tax and accounting rules and interpretations while also taking into account the interests of our stockholders for instance in 2006 we substantially revised the longterm incentive element of our compensation program when we introduced the cashbased myip in consideration of among other concerns changes to accounting rules regarding expense recognition for equitybased awards 

when appropriate the committee has also adjusted compensation components to account for the level of previous earnings by an executive officer for example in february 2006 the committee provided a supplemental oneyear plan under the myip for messrs anstice maddock and hariri in consideration for the absence of equity incentive grants to them in the years prior to the adoption of the myip and the relatively low level of equity incentive awards made to them in comparison to executive officers in similar positions from our peer group messrs anstice maddock and hariri have not received an equity award since 2002 

process annual incentive awards  our annual incentive awards provide for cash payments based on the corporate organizational and individual performance results achieved each calendar year corporate performance is determined primarily by operating income as a percent of revenue organizational and individual performance metrics generally fall in one or more of the following categories business process improvement customer relationships market share gains organizational capability new product development decreased cycle times and employee retention efforts typically the committee meets in january andor february to review the operating profit performance target and target incentive amounts for the first half of the calendar year and in august to review those targets for the second half of the calendar year by reviewing performance targets and accrued incentive amounts every six months the committee retains the ability to make adjustments as necessary to reflect changing business conditions and corporate objectives 

process myip the myip was designed and proposed to the committee by management and is a program under lam research’s stockholderapproved 2004 executive incentive plan the “eip” the cashbased incentive structure of the myip is intended to provide competitive levels of compensation to our senior executives while i allowing the company to accrue compensation expense during the period in which performance occurs ii as a nonequity program minimizing dilution of stockholder value and iii incentivizing senior management retention by generally requiring continuous employment through the payment determination date which is typically approximately two years following the start of the performance period performance factors are established by the committee annually and funding is accrued on a periodic basis a new myip cycle typically commences at the beginning of each calendar year and lasts for eight consecutive calendar quarters for instance our first myip cycle commenced in the first quarter of calendar year 2006 and ran through the end of calendar year 2007 the “2006 

myip” a second myip commenced in the first quarter of calendar year 2007 and runs through the end of calendar year 2008 the “2007 myip” and a third myip commenced in the first quarter of calendar year 2008 and runs through the end of calendar year 2009 the “2008 myip” to date the myip program performance metrics have been comprised of a formula based on attainment of the company’s operating profit target for each year and stock price because the committee believes these measurements represent the best indicators of the performance of the company and our executive team during the performance periods for the 2006 myip target award levels were determined after consideration of a study conducted during 2005 and 2006 by mercer consulting an objective third party consulting firm mercer consulting was engaged by management to provide information on the amounts that executives of the peer group realized pursuant to longterm equitybased incentive programs and to provide a recommendation on a competitive target award in lieu of equity grants for participants of the 2006 myip for the 2007 and 2008 myips the committee and the independent members of the board with respect to the ceo set target awards after consideration of the overall compensation package for the named executive officers the potential rewards from the myip and the competitive compensation environment typically the committee and the independent members of the board with respect to the ceo meets in january andor february to review and determine the operating profit performance metric for the thencurrent calendar year for each cyle of the myip then in effect 

process setting targets the committee establishes performance goals so that the specific performance targets will be challenging but achievable based on expected levels of performance from executive officers while providing that below expected performance would reduce the executive’s award performance goals are set such that very strong performance is required to earn payments above the target bonus amounts the company believes that our specific operating profit targets for awards granted as annual incentive awards and under the myip are confidential information and their disclosure would result in competitive harm to the company in 2006 and 2007 lam research achieved significant market share growth leading to a substantial expansion of revenues and profitability growth together these results led to the payment of above target bonuses as annual incentive awards and contributed to a maximum payout under the applicable myip performance cycle for calendar years 2007 and 2008 the committee revised the operating profit growth targets upward to provide a greater degree of difficulty in meeting those targets in light of the business plan and outlook each year 

peer group 

the committee also determines the levels of compensation and the mix and weighting of compensation components after reviewing data from a peer group of comparablysized companies in the high technology industry and from nationally published survey data 

the peer group companies are selected based on their comparability to lam research’s revenue size and business purpose and with whom we believe we are likely to compete for talent based on these criteria the peer group may be modified from one year to the next for 2007 the peer group consisted of the following companies 

 

in addition to peer group data our human resources department engaged outside consultants from radford the presidio group and fw cook  co to analyze published survey market data on base salary bonus targets equity awards and total compensation 

base salary 

for 2007 and 2008 after taking into consideration peer group compensation and management’s recommendations the committee and the independent members of the board with respect to the ceo set the base salaries of each of the named executive officers see table below as follows

annual incentive awards 

generally 

annual incentive awards for our executive officers for a specific calendar year are based on an individual performance factor a corporate performance factor and a target bonus amount based upon a percentage of annual eligible salary the actual incentive award is calculated by multiplying the individual factor by the corporate factor by the target bonus amount the portion of the award based upon individual performance is subject to a maximum multiplier determined at the beginning of the calendar year the corporate performance factor is applied using a fixed ratio based on the company’s actual operating profit achievement the calculated incentive award for executive officers other than the ceo may be increased by the committee and may be subject to negative discretion by the committee or the independent members of the board with respect to the ceo after the performance period 

the individual metrics for calendar years 2006 and 2007 were given equal weight with the corporate performance factor which was based upon operating income as a percent of revenue these objectives and relative weightings were selected based upon management recommendations and committee and board determination that they represented the most important metrics of company performance during the applicable calendar years and as a complement to the focus on the operating profit metric under the myip discussed below for calendar years 2006 and 2007 the portion of the award based upon individual performance was subject to a maximum multiplier of 15 on the performance factor 

mr newberry 

annual incentive awards for mr newberry for calendar years 2006 2007 and 2008 were made under lam research’s eip so that his bonus amounts would qualify for deductibility under section 162m of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “section 162m” discussed further below 

calendar year 2006 the board approved mr newberry’s target bonus amount for calendar year 2006 at 100 of his annual eligible salary the metrics for mr newberry’s individual performance were market share weighted at 30 revenue and gross margin weighted at 35 and cash from operations weighted at 35 these objectives together were given equal weight with the corporate performance factor which was based upon operating income as a percent of revenue for calendar year 2006 no discretion was exercised by the board in determining mr newberry’s annual incentive award mr newberry’s actual calendar year 2006 incentive award was calculated at 213 times his target bonus amount equal to a payout of 1485716 this amount is included in the nonequity incentive plan compensation column of the summary compensation table below 

calendar year 2007 in february 2007 the committee selected and the independent members of the board approved the annual bonus plan factors for mr newberry for calendar year 2007 and established targets for the first half of calendar 2007 each of the factors and their relative weighting for mr newberry’s 2007 annual bonus award were unchanged from the 2006 calendar year plan except that under the corporate performance factor actual operating profit growth targets were revised upward to provide a greater degree of difficulty in meeting those targets in light of the business plan and outlook for calendar year 2007 no changes were made to mr newberry’s performance targets for the second half of calendar year 2007 for calendar year 2007 no discretion was exercised by the board in determining mr newberry’s annual incentive award in february 2008 the committee recommended and the independent members of the board approved that mr newberry’s calendar year 2007 annual incentive award be calculated at 180 times his target bonus amount equal to a payout of 1427690 

in march 2008 based upon the committees recommendations the independent members of the board approved mr newberry’s target bonus amount for calendar year 2008 at 125 of base salary subject to a cap of 225 times the target bonus amount 

other named executive officers 

the individual performance factors for each executive also include organizational performance objectives based upon applicable business unit performance goals these objectives generally fall in one or more of the following categories business process improvement customer relationships market share gains organizational capability new product development decreased cycle times and employee retention efforts target bonus amounts ranged from 65 to 85 of annual salary for each executive the differences in target bonus amounts among the named executive officers are determined based on job scope and responsibilities and the competitive compensation data 

calendar year 2006 in february 2007 the committee approved incentive award payouts for calendar year 2006 performance at amounts ranging from 190 to 205 times the executives’ target bonus award reflecting each executive’s individual performance results actual dollar amounts are reported in the nonequity incentive plan compensation column of the summary compensation table below the committee did not exercise discretion to increase or reduce any awards during calendar year 2006 

calendar year 2007 in january 2008 the committee approved incentive award payouts for calendar year 2007 performance at amounts ranging from 161 to 180 times the executives’ target bonus award reflecting each executive’s individual performance results against the organizational objectives mentioned above additionally new target bonus amounts for calendar year 2008 were set for the named executive officers these amounts range from 70 to 80 of annual salary for each executive subject to a cap of 225 times the target bonus amount 

earned annual incentive awards for calendar years 2005 2006 and 2007 are provided in the table below for the named executive officers 

 

 

 multiyear cashbased incentive program “myip” 

the committee selects certain executives to participate in each myip during 2006 and 2007 cash awards under the myip were the only longterm incentive awards provided for the named executive officers with the exception of mr gottscho who received a grant of restricted share units but was not a participant in the 2006 or 2007 myips in addition messrs anstice maddock and hariri participated in a supplemental oneyear plan under the myip based on the company’s operating profit performance which covered performance in calendar year 2006 awards under the supplemental plan were determined and paid in february 2007 the committee established this supplemental plan in consideration of the absence of equity incentive grants to the participants since calendar year 2002 

in order to receive an award under the myip participants generally must be continuously employed at lam research through the dates on which the committee determines the actual award amounts under the applicable program the “determination date” the committee has the discretion to waive or otherwise adjust the retention criteria for individual participants for example mr bright is eligible to receive the target incentive amount established for his 2007 calendar year performance under the 2007 myip provided that mr bright remains employed by lam research through a vesting date of march 1 2008 

the company’s named executive officers excluding mr gottscho were eligible for performancebased awards under the following myips

myip performance periods 

performance factors comprised of a formula based on the attainment of the company’s operating profit target are established by the committee annually and measured and accrued on a quarterly basis in february 2006 the committee and the independent members of the board with respect to the ceo established the operating profit performance metric upon which actual incentive awards would be calculated for calendar 2006 in january 2007 the committee and the independent members of the board with respect to the ceo established the operating profit performance metric upon which actual incentive awards would be calculated for calendar 2007 under both the 2006 and 2007 myips in january 2008 the committee established the operating profit performance metric upon which actual incentive awards would be calculated for calendar year 2008 under both the 2007 and 2008 myips for the company’s named executive officers excluding mr newberry in march 2008 based on recommendations of the committee the independent members of the board established this metric for mr newberry 

additionally the 2006 the 2007 and the 2008 myips provide that the calculated award amounts are automatically increased but may not be decreased pursuant to a ratio comparing the company’s stock price performance over the 50 trading day trailing average as of the end of each fiscal quarter to the 200 trading day trailing average as of the beginning of the program under each program the actual award payable to each participant cannot exceed 25 times the target bonus amount set for each plan during calendar year 2006 and 2007 the stock price factor did positively affect the amounts calculated pursuant to the formula set forth in the respective myip 

the committee and the independent members of the board with respect to the ceo has the opportunity to review the provisional accruals on a periodic basis and may choose to exercise negative discretion to reduce the amount of award accruals following such review the committee and the independent members of the board with respect to the ceo did not exercise its negative discretion to reduce any award accruals during calendar years 2006 or 2007 with the exception of mr bright whose 2006 myip award payment was reduced from the calculated amount 

the aggregate individual target award amounts and the aggregate amounts earned for the named executive officers under each cycle of the myip except for mr gottscho who participates in the 2008 myip only were

equity incentive compensation 

the company believes that longterm equity incentive awards can be a useful part of its executive compensation program however as discussed above the company has chosen to grant primarily longterm cash incentive awards to its executive officers for calendar years 2006 and 2007 the committee or board may use its discretion to grant stock options or restricted stock units to executive officers in the future to provide competitive longterm incentives and to reward behaviors that result in longterm stockholder value growth at this time the company does not have a formal policy with respect to the timing of granting equity awards 

compensation of chief executive officer 

the company and mr newberry entered into an employment agreement the “newberry agreement” effective january 1 2003 which continues in effect pursuant to an automatic oneyear renewal provision the newberry agreement provides for a base salary at a rate to be set at least annually by the board under the newberry agreement mr newberry is entitled to participate in any performance incentive plan offered by the company in the company’s executive deferred compensation plans and in other benefit and compensation programs generally applicable to key executives of the company the newberry agreement includes severance provisions which are described below in the “potential payments under termination of employment or changeincontrol” section below 

compensation of executive chairman 

the company and mr bagley entered into a new employment agreement the “bagley agreement” effective january 1 2006 the term of the bagley agreement is from january 1 2006 to march 31 2009 unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with its provisions pursuant to the terms and conditions of the bagley agreement mr bagley will continue to serve as executive chairman of the company during the term of the agreement mr bagley will receive an annual salary of 240000 provided he remains employed by the company subject to certain noncompete and other terms and conditions the bagley agreement provides for a lump sum payment of 25 million on april 15 2009 during the term of the bagley agreement mr bagley will not participate in any executive bonus plans maintained by the company mr bagley however is eligible to participate in the standard executive benefit plans maintained by the company during the term of the bagley agreement mr bagley agrees not to perform services for any other forprofit enterprise that would interfere with his services to or otherwise compete with the company the bagley agreement includes severance provisions which are described below in the “potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol” section below 

change in control and severance arrangements 

lam research generally does not provide for severance or change in control benefits to executive officers except for individually negotiated arrangements such as those with messrs newberry bagley and bright these arrangements are more fully described in the “potential payments upon termination of employment or changeincontrol” section below we use such individually negotiated arrangements for recruitment and retention purposes and in order to provide a period during which a former executive will be incentivised not to engage in competitive activities 

however as discussed below we do provide medical and dental insurance retirement benefits to eligible former officers and members of our board furthermore certain of the company’s stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan provide that upon a merger of the company with or into another corporation or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company some or all of the options granted under certain of the stock option plans shall be accelerated so as to be fully exercisable and all of the rights granted under the employee stock purchase plans shall be fully exercisable following the merger for a period from the date of notice by the board following the expiration of such periods the options and rights will terminate the 2007 stock incentive plan adopted by company stockholders at the 2006 annual meeting allows the company broad discretion to provide for vesting acceleration of awards on changeofcontrol transactions 

elective deferred compensation plan 

lam research maintains a nonqualified deferred compensation plan the elective deferred compensation plan the “edcp” which allows eligible employees including executive officers to voluntarily defer receipt of all or a portion of hisher salary and all or a portion of a bonus payment until the date or dates elected by the participant thereby allowing the participating employee to defer taxation on such amounts the edcp is offered to eligible employees including the named executive officers in order to allow them to defer more compensation than they would otherwise be permitted to defer under a taxqualified retirement plan such as the lam research corporation employee savings plus plan the “401k plan” further lam research offers the edcp as a competitive practice to enable it to attract and retain top talent 

the edcp is evaluated by the human resources group for competitiveness in the marketplace from time to time but the level of benefits provided is not typically taken into account in determining an executive’s overall compensation package for a particular year due to its conservative nature 

retirement benefits under the 401k plan and notgenerallyavailable benefit programs 

each of lam research’s named executive officers is eligible for additional benefits generally available to company employees such as matching contributions to lam research’s 401k plan and medical coverage benefits lam research also provides additional benefits to its named executive officers that are not generally available to other company employees including the payment of term life insurance premiums payment of medical coinsurance premiums and matching contributions to the edcp in lieu of decreased contributions that would otherwise have been made had such edcp deferrals not been made the amount of the company edcp contribution that is not generally available to other company employees is shown in the “all other compensation table” below 

medical and dental insurance retirement benefit 

the company provides a program to pay for postretirement medical and dental insurance coverage for eligible former executive officers and members of lam research’s board of directors to be eligible a person must have served at the position of vice president or above or as a member of the board of directors be at least age 55 at retirement and have at least five years of continuous service with lam research an executive officer or director must be enrolled in the company’s us group medical and dental plans at the time of his or her retirement when the retired person reaches age 65 he or she is required to enroll in medicare parts a and b which would be the primary payer for the executive’s health coverage the benefit also covers the person’s spouse at the time of retirement for his or her lifetime as well as other eligible dependents the benefit ceases if the person becomes employed by a competitor of lam research after leaving the company’s service we provide the benefit to our executives and members of our board to further the longterm retention of their services andor provide a disincentive to later compete against the company 

executive stock ownership guidelines 

during fiscal year 2006 the company adopted executive stock ownership guidelines pursuant to which senior executives are expected and encouraged to own and maintain certain minimum levels of the company’s common stock the committee believes that these guidelines are an appropriate addition to the company’s equity compensation policies and in conjunction with lam research’s equity and cashbased incentive plans will further serve to align the longterm interests of the senior executives with those of the company’s stockholders each executive is required to accumulate and maintain ownership of shares of the company’s common stock in the quantities indicated by the guidelines below by the later of december 31 2010 or the fifth anniversary of an executive’s hire date 

 

accounting and tax considerations 

mr hariri received taxable income in fiscal year 2007 on the tax payments made on mr hariri’s behalf by the company to compensate for the difference in income tax liabilities resulting from an expatriate assignment 

in determining which elements of compensation are to be paid and how they are weighted lam research also takes into account whether a particular form of compensation will be considered “performancebased” compensation for purposes of section 162m of the internal revenue code under section 162m lam research generally receives a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid to any of its named executive officers only if the compensation is less than 1 million during any fiscal year or is “performancebased” under section 162m in 2004 lam research adopted the eip with a structure intended to provide for the tax deductibility of awards granted under the eip accordingly during fiscal 2007 the annual incentive awards granted to mr newberry and to the greatest extent possible all myip grants to mr newberry and the other named executive officers were granted under lam research’s eip in november 2006 our stockholders approved an amendment to the eip that increased the 

amount of cash awards that may be paid to any one participant in respect of achievement of performance goals for any twelvemonth period to 12 million prior to the amendment the maximum amount of awards that could be paid to a participant in a twelvemonth period and qualify for deductiblity under section 162m was 2 million accordingly we expect that all myip grants made after passage of the amendment will qualify for deductibility under section 162m the prior 2 million limit for deductibility will likely apply to performance periods under grants prior to the amendment the committee currently intends to continue to seek a tax deduction for all of lam research’s executive compensation to the extent it determines it is in the best interests of lam research 

to assist in the avoidance of additional tax under section 409a of the internal revenue code lam research structured the myip and the edcp and structures its equity awards in a manner intended to comply with the applicable section 409a requirements it is lam research’s general philosophy not to provide any executive officer or director with a grossup or other reimbursement for tax amounts the individual might pay pursuant to section 280g of the internal revenue code

 nonqualified deferred compensation table 

 

 

 the company first adopted a deferred compensation plan in 1994 the “1994 deferral plan” the 1994 deferral plan remains in effect but was closed to further contributions as of december 31 2004 the company adopted a new deferred compensation plan the “edcp” effective january 1 2005 contributions by eligible executives on or after january 1 2005 will be maintained in the edcp both deferred compensation plans are voluntary nontaxqualified deferred compensation plans that encourage executives to save for retirement under the deferred compensation plans participants were and are entitled to defer compensation until retirement death other termination of employment or until specified dates 

potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol 

the company provides a program to pay for postretirement medical and dental insurance coverage for eligible former executive officers the “executive retirement medical benefit plan” annually lam research has an independent actuarial valuation of this postretirement benefit conducted in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the statement of financial accounting standards 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas no 106 the most recent valuation conducted in august 2007 valued lam research’s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the named executive officers mr bagley and directors under the plan at 603000 the amounts for the named executive officers and mr bagley are shown in the table below 

 

in addition certain of the company’s stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan provide that upon a merger of the company with or into another corporation or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company each outstanding option or right to purchase common stock shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation in the event that the successor corporation does not agree to assume the option or right or substitute an equivalent option or right at the discretion of the plan administrator some or all of the options granted under certain of the stock option plans shall be accelerated so as to be fully exercisable and all of the rights granted under the employee stock purchase plans shall be fully exercisable following the merger for a period from the date of notice by the board of directors following the expiration of such periods the options and rights will terminate the 2007 stock incentive plan adopted by lam research stockholders at the 2006 annual meeting allows the company broad discretion to provide for vesting acceleration of awards on changeofcontrol transactions 

the tables below quantify the amount that would be payable to each of messrs newberry bright and bagley assuming the termination of his employment on june 24 2007 and are estimates of the amounts which would be paid out to each executive upon his termination the actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of the triggering events 

newberry agreement 

the newberry agreement provides that in the event of involuntary termination without cause as defined in the agreement or a change in control of the company followed by either involuntary termination or the acceptance of a position of materially lesser authority or responsibility offered to mr newberry by the company or if the company is acquired by another entity so that there will be no market for the common stock of the company and the acquiring entity does not provide options comparable to unvested stock options held by mr newberry all unvested stock options granted to mr newberry will automatically be accelerated in full so as to become fully vested mr newberry is presently fully vested in his stock options but such provision applies to any future grants mr newberry will have two years from the date of termination in which to exercise such options 

if mr newberry’s employment is involuntarily terminated without cause he will be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to fifteen 15 months of his thenannual base compensation and he will receive annually any benefits under the executive retirement medical benefit plan for which he qualifies following the date of termination if mr newberry resigns voluntarily he will not be entitled to receive any severance benefits under the newberry agreement with the exception of the benefits that he would qualify for under the executive retirement medical benefit plan in the event of mr newberry’s death his estate will be entitled to receive an amount equal to mr newberry’s annual base salary payable in a lump sum if mr newberry becomes disabled he will be entitled to receive his base salary for a period of twelve 12 months from the date disability is certified as well as any bonus earned prior to the effective date of disability 

the newberry agreement provides that for a period of six months following mr newberry’s termination of employment with the company mr newberry may not solicit any of the company’s employees to become employed by any other business enterprise

 item 1 business 

lam research corporation lam or the company a delaware corporation was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in fremont california the mailing address for our principal executive offices is 4650 cushing parkway fremont california 94538 and our telephone number is 510 5720200 additional information about lam is available on our web site at httpwwwlamresearchcom our forms 10k forms 10q and forms 8k are available online at the securities and exchange commission sec web site on the internet the address of that site is httpwwwsecgov we also make available free of charge the forms 10k forms 10q and forms 8k and any amendments to those reports on our corporate web site at httpwwwlamresearchcom as soon as reasonably possible after we file them with or furnish them to the sec 

we design manufacture market and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits our products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of semiconductors we leverage our expertise in these areas to develop intellectual property ip for integrated processing solutions 

etch process 

etch processes which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today to etch devices designed at current and future technology nodes our etch systems employ various technologies utilized to generate plasma sources a critical requirement of the etch process 

the etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic and submicroscopic features on integrated circuits plasma etching was developed to meet the demand for device geometries smaller than 3 microns plasma consists of charged and neutral species that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric metal or polysilicon material and produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit 

advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of creating structures for the 9065 nanometer nm technology node for currentgeneration products and for the 65 nm and below technology nodes for future semiconductor products at this time memory manufacturers are continuing to transition from aluminum to copper conductive lines while leading logic manufacturers are progressing with the implementation of more fragile dielectric insulating materials low k and porous low k advanced manufacturing facilities are producing integrated circuits on 300 millimeter mm 12 inch silicon wafers while other facilities use wafer diameters of 200 mm 8 inch and smaller semiconductor manufacturers will continue to require more precise 

  

control over the etching process in order to accommodate these decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters our etch products and services are defined around the alliance ® and 2300 ® etch series platforms 

dielectric etch products 

  exelan ®  exelan high performance exelan hpt 2300 exelan 2300 exelan flex™ and 2300 exelan flex45™ systems  the exelan family of products improves productivity and enables our customers to create today’s most advanced semiconductor devices these systems based on lam’s patented dual frequency confined dfc technology can be extended to keep pace with the semiconductor industry’s roadmap for etching smaller features and newer dielectric materials exelan was introduced to meet the requirements for manufacturing copper conductive lines using dual damascene etch schemes exelan has been extended through a series of performance improvement upgrades exelan high performance and exelan hpt to meet the etch requirements for the sub130 nm technology node the 2300 exelan which was introduced to address the industry’s transition to 300 mm wafers is a 200 mm and 300 mm wafer capable product the 2300 exelan flex and exelan flex45 extend the capability of the 2300 exelan family of products to address the requirements for 65 nm and below technology nodes 

conductor etch products 

  tcp ® 9400 and tcp ® 9600 series and 2300 versys ® series systems  the first tcp products were introduced in late 1992 they use lam’s patented transformer coupled plasma™ source technology a highdensity lowpressure plasma source that can etch features for the 130 nm and below technology nodes for 200 mm wafer sizes we offer the tcp ® 9400ptx and tcp ® 9400dfm for silicon etch applications the tcp ® 9400dsie™ for mems microelectromechanical systems based deep silicon etch and the tcp ® 9600ptx and tcp ® 9600dfm for metal etch applications these systems are used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices as well as mems applications 

the 2300 versys system for etching silicon and metal films employs a scaled design of tcp technology to address leadingedge device structure requirements the 2300 versys system has the capability to process 200 mm and 300 mm wafer sizes the 2300 versys hp addresses metal etch requirements for the 90 nm node and beyond the 2300 versys metal45™ addresses backend metal etch uniformity and throughput needs for memory customers at 70 nm and beyond as well as metal hard mask applications for logic customers at 45 nm and beyond the 2300 versys star™ silicon etch system enables sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature which provides the critical dimension uniformity required for sub110 nm technology nodes the 2300 versys kiyo™ and versys kiyo45 enable processing at sub65 nm technology nodes 

lam 2300 process chambers can be converted within our customers’ facilities from 200 mm to 300 mm which has the advantage of providing customers with greater flexibility and lower costs this capability combined with an overall system footprint comparable to 200 mm systems allows semiconductor manufacturers to develop integrated circuits using 200 mm wafers instead of more expensive 300 mm wafers and later scale up to 300 mm wafer processing 

resist strip products 

lam offers integrated strip modules that remove the photoresist following metal and silicon etch for both 200 mm and 300 mm wafer manufacturing stripping the resist on the same system prevents exposure to air protecting the wafers from corrosion 

for 65 nm technologies and below resist stripping after ion implantation is becoming a critical step because of the difficulty in fully cleaning resist residues without removing too much of the silicon to address this emerging market lam has extended its successful silicon etch product line used in combination with a microwave resist stripper for both 200 mm and 300 mm wafer processing 

cleaning process 

as semiconductor devices are manufactured through a series of deposition and patterning steps wafers must be cleaned periodically to remove residues and contamination that could degrade device performance these cleaning operations which typically follow a plasma etch or strip step involve placing a wafer in contact with a liquid cleaning agent which removes surface residues through a combination of reaction and dissolution 

at the 65 nm technology node and below wafer cleaning is becoming increasingly challenging because the smaller more fragile devices are more susceptible to damage from the chemistries and mechanical forces of the cleaning process as a result many semiconductor manufacturers are transitioning from batch to singlewafer cleaning systems which enable better control of the cleaning process lam provides technologies that it believes address the damage concerns of wafer cleaning at sub65 nm allowing chemical cleaning to be extended to future technology nodes 

  2300 cleaning products based on the productionproven 2300 etch platform lam’s products are designed to offer cleaning capability for sub65 nm technologies lam’s proprietary confined chemical cleaning™ technology provides a short chemical exposure time that limits contact with device structures thereby lowering the risk of damage in addition the short exposure time allows greater flexibility in selecting cleaning chemicals for effective removal of process residues 

there were no fiscal year 2006 revenues from 2300 cleaning products 

  2300 bevel clean product lam offers bevel clean modules that remove films on the edge of the wafer using edge confined plasma technology for 65 nm technologies and below a primary source of device yield limiters are coming from defects transferred from the wafer edge during device patterning complex interactions of film deposition lithography etching and chemical mechanical polishing cmp result in a wide range of unstable film stacks on the wafer edge in subsequent steps these film layers can produce defects that are transported to the device area of the wafer removal of these films at select points in the integration flow results in reduced defects and higher device yields to address this emerging market lam’s edge confined plasma provides customers with the latitude to control the wafer edge at multiple steps during the device fabrication process plasma processing can remove a broad range of films with precise control of the processing zone

research and development 

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to maintain competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to rd programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 were 2289 million 1941 million and 1705 million respectively expenditures are targeted at developing new product areas and continued enhancements to our existing products we believe current challenges for customers in the pre and postetch applications present opportunities for us many of these challenges are new and are a result of the transition to sub 90nanometer device structures we plan to leverage our extensive production experience in etch and strip into new products and new capabilities for our customers at the 65 45 and 32nanometer nodes including post ion implantation strip clean and patterning 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service 

our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers that work closely with individual customers to develop solutions to their processing needs we maintain ongoing support relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of field service personnel in place throughout the united states europe korea japan and asia pacific we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace 

we offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer the warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to our published specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired 

export sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls compliance with us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions and economic and political conditions there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows sales were as follows 

 

customers 

our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers customers continue to establish joint ventures alliances and technology licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position in fiscal year 2006 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd accounted for approximately 15 of total revenues and revenues from toshiba corporation accounted for approximately 12 of total revenues in fiscal year 2005 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd accounted for approximately 13 of total revenues and in fiscal year 2004 revenues from st microelectronics accounted for approximately 15 of total revenues 

a material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ business in turn depends on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes we schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers’ delivery requirements included in our systems backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted prices and product specifications have been agreed upon and shipment of systems is expected within one year the spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not exceeding 12 months in calculating backlog amounts 

as of june 25 2006 and june 26 2005 our backlog was approximately 521 million and 351 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we continue to believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies included in our products are only obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our business we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production and cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 4 2006 we had approximately 2430 regular fulltime employees 

each of our employees is required to sign an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information all employees are required to sign an acknowledgement that they have read and agree to abide by a statement of standards of business conduct in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world in order to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements etc our ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of highquality and cost efficient spare parts in the presence of thirdparty spares provider competition 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations than we do we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics if our competitors make 

acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc 

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately 3 to 17 years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they will not alone determine our success which depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended or should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations our operating results may be adversely affected because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

 

further because a significant amount of our rd and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont california campus natural physical logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities including labor disruptions earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance 

we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of highpriced systems 

system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems can typically range in price up to approximately 60 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems as a result the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter 

variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably 

fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results where appropriate we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our financial results 

we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products moreover future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of these products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

in addition the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products as well this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment our business is affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps this might have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue new orders and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

strategic alliances may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies often one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while this could work to our advantage if lam’s equipment becomes the basis for the function or process it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process in the latter case even if lam’s equipment was previously used by a customer that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance 

similarly our customers may team with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines these actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business 

we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers 

we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we have established longterm contracts with many of these suppliers these longterm contracts can take a variety of forms we may renew these contracts periodically in some cases these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers however several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them 

and their performance is limited where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships 

our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 

outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in addition the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships andor have a negative effect on our operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment 

we are subject to risks associated with our competitors’ strategic relationships and their introduction of new products and we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share 

we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently or expect to offer they may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 86 in fiscal year 2006 84 in fiscal year 2005 and 82 in fiscal year 2004 of our total revenue we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years 

we are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations and international sales are subject to risks including but not limited to 

 

certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between china taiwan japan and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with china andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues in japan that are denominated in japanese yen certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency 

we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated assets and forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over or underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging our yendenominated assets with currency forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we currently do not enter into such forward contracts for currencies other than the yen and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business including intercompany transactions in other currencies 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws or by 

material audit assessments which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

changes in accounting standards for equitybased compensation may adversely affect our operating results our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 

the adoption of sfas no 123r required us to expense all equitybased compensation provided to employees and directors beginning with our quarter ending september 25 2005 the environment for skilled employees that are knowledgeable about our products and services is a competitive one and we believe that equitybased compensation is an important part of the overall compensation that we offer to attract and retain such employees sfas no 123r has decreased and will continue to decrease our earnings based on its measure of the value of equitybased compensation there is some risk that the design of our compensation plans is ineffective at balancing our profitability and employee retention objectives 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

if we are unable to adjust the scale of our business in response to rapid changes in demand in the semiconductor equipment industry our operating results and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired 

the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures and in training managing and appropriately sizing our supply chain our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively if we do not adequately meet these challenges our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies which no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions 

the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors including but not limited to the following 

 

in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our common stock 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment to the extent that these information systems are under our control we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to address the outlined risks however security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results moreover although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur 

we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights which would affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise continuing our development of new systems increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers however we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications in addition the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages 

we are subject to the internal control evaluation and attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year furthermore our independent registered public accounting firm firm is required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year we have successfully completed our assessment and obtained our firm’s attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 25 2006 in future years if we fail to timely complete this assessment or if our firm cannot timely attest to our assessment we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control in addition any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations 

our independent registered public accounting firm must confirm its independence in order for us to meet our regulatory reporting obligations on a timely basis 

our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the firm and lam that in the firm’s professional judgment might have a bearing on the firm’s independence with respect to us if for whatever reason our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of lam based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements which are subject to risks uncertainties and changes in condition significance value and effect our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission see “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report on form 10k  

the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions supply demand and prices for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k mda consists of the following sections 

  executive summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations

executive summary 

lam research corporation lam or the company is a major provider of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the world’s semiconductor industry we actively market and sell product offerings that include singlewafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers 

the following summarizes certain key quarterly and annual financial information for the periods indicated below in thousands except per share data and percentages and demonstrates our strong performance and the quarteroverquarter growth in all areas throughout fiscal year 2006 

 

our business model which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers enables us to focus on new and existing product development sales and marketing and customer support we are focused on executing to the near term production requirements of 

our customers expanding our leadership position in etch leveraging our etch expertise into adjacent markets and our objective of delivering bestinclass financial performance 

customer demand increased throughout fiscal year 2006 fiscal year 2006 new orders entered into backlog increased 31 compared to fiscal year 2005 with growth occurring in all regions as a function of the increase in customer demand 

fiscal year 2006 revenues derived from our shipment levels and installation and acceptance timelines increased 9 compared to fiscal year 2005 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market with the strongest geographic momentum in japan and korea 

gross margin as a percent of revenues remained greater than 50 for the second consecutive year fiscal year 2006 quarterly gross margin as a percent of revenues showed steady growth on increasing volume 

total operating expenses increased 13 during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily driven by increases in discretionary rd spending consistent with our product and market expansion plans equitybased compensation expense salary costs as a result of increased headcount planned increases in employee base compensation and employee incentivebased costs fiscal year 2005 operating expenses included 142 million in restructuring charges related to prior restructuring plans 

equitybased compensation expense recognized during fiscal year 2006 in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was 50 million and 178 million respectively 

results of operations 

new orders and backlog 

new orders entered into backlog during fiscal year 2006 are presented in the table below 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 25 2006 were approximately 521 million the basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect among other things spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our backlog policy 

regional geographic breakdown of new orders is as follows 

 

 

fiscal year 2005 started with a declining trend in new orders which stabilized in the march 2005 and june 2005 quarters the four quarters ending june 25 2006 showed sequentially increasing demand in new orders driven by increased capital investments by our customers and our market share gains during fiscal year 2006 300 millimeter applications represented approximately 81 of total systems new orders and 83 of total systems new orders were for applications at less than or equal to the 90 nanometer technology node we classify total systems new orders market segmentation for fiscal year 2006 as memory at approximately 54 idm logicother at 27 and foundry at 19 of the total 

we expect new orders for the quarter ending september 24 2006 to increase 5 to 10 compared with the quarter ended june 25 2006 this expectation is a forwardlooking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in part i of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue 

 

the increase in revenues during fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2005 reflected the improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers we believe we have gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market over this period with particularly strong geographic performance in japan and korea during fiscal year 2006 and the overall asia region during fiscal year 2005 the overall asia region continues to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region our deferred revenue balance increased to 2297 million as of june 25 2006 compared to 1505 million at june 26 2005 consistent with overall business volumes the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately 74 million as of june 25 2006 these shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers 

regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows 

 

our current estimate for revenues for the quarter ending september 24 2006 ranges from 580 million to 600 million this is a forwardlooking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in part i of this annual report on form 10k 

gross margin 

 

gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2006 remained greater than 50 for the second consecutive year gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2006 compared with fiscal year 2005 decreased slightly impacted by the inclusion of equitybased compensation as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r of 50 million or 03 the impact of product mix was generally offset by improved installation and warranty performance and improved factory utilization which was facilitated by higher volumes the increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven primarily by improved product mix and effective asset management on higher sales volume 

we expect that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 515 for the quarter ending september 24 2006 this expectation is a forwardlooking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in part i of this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

 

we invested significantly in research and development focused on leadingedge plasma etch strip and clean product and market applications the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to approximately 19 million in increased supplies and outside services approximately 9 million in increased equitybased compensation expense and approximately 4 million in increased salary and benefit costs due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount approximately 66 of fiscal year 2006 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years 

the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately 5 million for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly 9 million for incentivebased compensation triggered by higher profits the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in rd supplies expense of approximately 6 million 

selling general and administrative 

 

the increase in sga expenses during the year ended june 25 2006 compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately 4 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount increases in incentivebased cash compensation of approximately 7 million were principally due to our longterm executive compensation program implemented during fiscal year 2006 and equitybased compensation was approximately 9 million fiscal year 2005 sga expenses were lower due to the march 2005 receipt of an 8 million tax refund noted below 

the increase in sga expenses during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately 5 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly 14 million due to incentivebased compensation triggered by higher profits also included in the increase was approximately 10 million in professional services which included among other items expenditures for certain discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the company these increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal year 2005 of a net 8 million tax refund from the california state board of equalization for previously paid sales and use tax and approximately 3 million in equitybased compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2004 in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option award 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 

 

the sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate yields 

during fiscal year 2006 average interest rate yields on the company’s portfolio increased approximately 170 basis points compared to fiscal year 2005 the company’s total balances of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments increased approximately 626 million from fiscal year 2005 this increase included the company’s whollyowned subsidiary’s drawdown against a 350 million credit agreement to support the company’s foreign earnings repatriation of 500 million under the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca the remaining increase of 276 million was primarily driven by 361 million from cash flows from operating activities 

the sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was due primarily to the increase in interest rate yields interest expense and debt issue cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our convertible subordinated 3000 million 4 notes 4 notes in june 2004 

tax expense 

our annual income tax expense was 1055 million 998 million and 277 million in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 239 the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 excluding the discrete event discussed below was 184 the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2006 related to the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate the realization of state rd tax credits not previously benefited favorable tax rulings on prior year tax returns filed and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to the agreement of a bilateral advanced pricing arrangement these favorable adjustments for the year were offset by a discrete event for the repatriation during fiscal year 2006 of a 500 million extraordinary dividend under the american jobs creation act of 2004 combined with the impact of the accounting for equitybased awards in accordance with sfas no 123r and the deductibility of those awards in some jurisdictions and the expiration of the research tax credit on december 31 2005 

the fiscal year 2005 tax rate was 250 which primarily reflects the impact of rd tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower than us statutory tax rates in fiscal year 2004 we released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required this resulted in a 127 million credit recorded to income tax expense during fiscal year 2004 

deferred income taxes 

we had gross deferred tax assets related primarily to reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards of 1192 million and 1421 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively the gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of 270 million and 222 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r the additional tax benefit associated with the accumulated stock award attributes is not recognized until the deduction reduces cash taxes payable as such we have elected to net our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb no 25 we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only realize these attributes in accordance with footnote 82 of sfas 123r these additional tax benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards related to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock awards were 1252 million and 1060 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances if any during fiscal year 2004 we released a valuation allowance of 127 million on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required 

subsequent events 

on july 12 2006 the supreme court of california denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of lam with respect to a lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of our customers as a result of the denied review the prior rulings from the trial and appellate courts stand resulting in a judgment in favor of lam of approximately 158 million which includes approximately 20 million in postjudgment interest we plan to record this amount in other income expense net during the quarter ending september 24 2006 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluated them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have completed our system installation obligations received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract 

  inventory valuation  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale when the terms of sale do not specify we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance 

standard costs are reassessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts currently obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels and overhead for internally manufactured products manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory if future customer demand or market 

conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 

  warranty  typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer when appropriate we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability trends all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping 

actual warranty expenses are incurred on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 

  equitybased compensation — employee stock purchase plan and employee stock plans  beginning on june 27 2005 we account for our employee stock purchase plan espp and stock plans under the provisions of sfas no 123r sfas no 123r requires the recognition of the fair value of equitybased compensation in net income the fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant the fair value of our stock options and espp awards was estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing sfas no 123r including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award the fair value of equitybased awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straightline method for awards granted after the adoption of sfas no 123r and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we accounted for our espp and stock option plans under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb no 25 and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 44 “accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation — an interpretation of apb opinion no 25” and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” which amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements were estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r we will only recognize a benefit from stockbased compensation in paidincapital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized in addition we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stockbased compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the income statement continuing operations rather than through paidincapital we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under apb no 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paidincapital in accordance with footnote 82 of sfas123r 

  income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 

we provide for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the company the level of rd spending the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed we carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate if necessary if actual results differ from estimates we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the company’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s results of operation and financial condition the company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation 48 “accounting for income tax uncertainties” fin 48 fin 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “morelikelythannot” to be sustained by the taxing authority the recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties along with any related interest and penalties fin 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 

fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulativeeffect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings we are currently in the process of determining the impact if any of adopting the provisions of fin 48 on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of june 25 2006 we had 15 billion in cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments compared with 8943 million at june 26 2005 we entered into longterm debt of 3500 million during fiscal year 2006 to provide sufficient liquidity to support our foreign earnings repatriation of 500 million under the american jobs creation act of 2004 the remaining increase of 2761 million was derived from cash flows from operating activities of 3607 million issuance of common stock from employee equitybased plans of 1946 million partially offset by stock repurchases of 2512 million and capital expenditures and purchases of intangible assets of 421 million 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 3607 million during fiscal year 2006 consisted of in millions 

 

significant changes in assets and liabilities included increases in accounts receivable and inventory of 1753 million and 587 million respectively due to the increased volume of business these changes were partially offset by an increase in deferred profit of 504 million due to increased volume of shipments an increase in accounts payable of 483 million and increases in accrued liabilities of 884 million primarily due to vat and income taxes payable related to higher profit levels and an increase in accrued compensation based on incentivebased compensation 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2006 was 2443 million and consisted of a transfer to restricted cash and investments of 3850 million due to our guarantee agreement related to the obligations of our whollyowned subsidiary under the 3500 million credit agreement entered into during the quarter ended june 25 2006 our obligations under the guarantee agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110 of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the guarantee agreement 

in addition we purchased 421 million for capital expenditures consisting primarily of engineering equipment and the purchase of intangible assets of intellectual property partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds from the net sales of shortterm investments of 1828 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2006 was 3107 million consisting of 3500 million from the issuance of longterm debt 1946 million from the issuance of our common stock related to employee equitybased plans and 178 million of excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation plans partially offset by stock repurchases of 2512 million 

during fiscal year 2006 we repurchased approximately 70 million shares of common stock at a total price of 2512 million under board authorized repurchase programs which run through september 30 2008 as of june 25 2006 the total amount remaining available for repurchase under board authorizations was 3317 million we expect to continue to repurchase shares consistent with the board authorizations the level of which will be determined by including but not limited to the needs of the business and the stock price and daily trading volumes of our stock 

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based upon our current business outlook our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 25 2006 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments debt service requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products should additional funding be required we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that in the event of such requirements we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not to make future payments under various contracts obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities and longterm debt which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below our offbalance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table 

 

operating leases 

we lease most of our administrative rd and manufacturing facilities regional salesservice offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through 2021 certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont california headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation 

included in the operating leases 13 years section of the table above is 750 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our fremont california campus as part of the lease agreements we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately 850 million we are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to 750 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 in the event that the leases are not renewed we do not exercise the purchase options the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs we maintain cash collateral of 850 million as part of the lease agreements as of june 25 2006 in separate specified certificates of deposit and interestbearing accounts which are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our consolidated balance sheet the lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity vie as defined by fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us 

the remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to noncancelable facilityrelated operating leases 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multiyear periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments including vendorconsigned inventories we continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities including elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities maintenance certain information technology functions and certain transactional general and administrative functions the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 25 2006 under these arrangements and others actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition to minimum spending commitments certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges 

consignment inventories which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined at june 25 2006 vendorowned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory increased to 311 million compared to 148 million at june 26 2005 due to the increased volume of our business 

restructuring liabilities 

our total restructuring reserves as of june 25 2006 were 16 million which consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings through cash generated from operations we expect the remaining balance to be paid over the next twelve months 

longterm debt and interest expense 

on june 16 2006 our whollyowned subsidiary lam research international sarl lri as borrower entered into a 350 million credit agreement the credit agreement 

under the credit agreement on june 19 2006 lri borrowed 350 million in principal amount the loan under the credit agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the closing date and will bear interest at libor plus a spread ranging from 010 to 050 depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the initial spread under the credit agreement is 010 lri may prepay the loan under the credit agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty subject to reimbursement of lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases the amounts in the table above include the principal payment of 350 million due on june 19 2011 and interest payments estimated based on the current libor rate of 55 and initial spread of ten basis points the fair value of longterm debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt 

we used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by lri to facilitate the repatriation of 500 million of foreign earnings in the june 2006 quarter under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca we have now completed our repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the ajca 

guarantees 

we account for our guarantees in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin no 45 fin no 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued fin no 45 also requires a company the guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 

we lease several facilities at our headquarters location in fremont california as part of certain of the lease agreements we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately 850 million we are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to 750 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 in the event that the leases are not renewed we do not exercise the purchase options the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs we maintain cash collateral of 850 million as part of the lease agreements as of june 25 2006 in separate specified certificates of deposit and interestbearing accounts which are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our consolidated balance sheet the lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity vie as defined by fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us 

we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our agreements we have entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit our exposure to such indemnifications as of june 25 2006 we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees 

in connection with the credit agreement entered into by lri noted above we entered into a guarantee agreement the guarantee agreement guaranteeing the obligations of lri under the credit agreement our obligations under the guarantee agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110 of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the guarantee agreement representing 3850 million at june 25 2006 this collateral is reflected in the balance of restricted cash and investments in our consolidated balance sheet 

generally we indemnify under predetermined conditions and limitations our customers for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees 

we offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer the liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system customer and geographic region modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate longterm debt we maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk the table below presents principal amounts and related weightedaverage tax equivalent interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at june 25 2006 and june 26 2005 

 

we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues in japan that are denominated in japanese yen certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies and expenses related to our nonus sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated assets and forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted japanese yendenominated revenues we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months these foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of japanese yendenominated net receivable balances the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables recorded in other income and expense assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 

on june 25 2006 the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was 235 million the unrealized gain on the contracts on june 25 2006 was 01 million a 15 appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of 41 million depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately 15 would result in an unrealized gain of 31 million these changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances on june 25 2006 the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was 1938 million a 15 appreciation of the japanese yen would 

result in an unrealized loss of 342 million depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately 15 would result in an unrealized gain of 253 million 

our outstanding longterm debt of 3500 million bears interest at libor plus a spread ranging from 010 to 050 depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the initial spread under the credit agreement is 010 the principal payment of 350 million is due on june 19 2011 the fair value of longterm debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by exchange act rule 13a15b as of the close of fiscal year june 25 2006 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer along with our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control—integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 25 2006 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included at the end of part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met

 item 1 business 

lam research corporation lam or the company a delaware corporation was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in fremont california the mailing address for our principal executive offices is 4650 cushing parkway fremont california 94538 and our telephone number is 510 5720200 additional information about lam is available on our web site at httpwwwlamrccom our forms 10k forms 10q and forms 8k are available online at the securities and exchange commission sec web site on the internet the address of that site is httpwwwsecgov we also make available free of charge the forms 10k forms 10q and forms 8k and any amendments to those reports on our corporate web site at httpwwwlamrccom as soon as reasonably possible after we file them with or furnish them to the sec 

we design manufacture market and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major supplier of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits our products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer to create semiconductors we leverage our expertise in these areas to develop intellectual property ip for integrated processing solutions 

etch process 

etch processes which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today to etch devices designed at current and future technology nodes our etch systems employ lam’s tcp™ high density and dual frequency confined™ dfc™ medium density plasma sources 

the etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic and submicroscopic features on integrated circuits plasma etching was developed to meet the demand for device geometries smaller than 3 microns plasma consists of charged and neutral species that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric metal or polysilicon material and produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit 

advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of creating structures for the 11090 nanometer nm technology node for currentgeneration products and for the 90 nm and below technology nodes for future semiconductor products at this time memory manufacturers are continuing to transition from aluminum to copper conductive lines while leading logic manufacturers are progressing with the implementation of more fragile insulating dielectric materials low k and porous low k in addition to these changes advanced manufacturing facilities are now producing integrated circuits on 300 millimeter mm 12 inch silicon wafers while other facilities use wafer diameters of 200 mm 8 inch and smaller semiconductor manufacturers will continue to require more precise control over the etching process in order to accommodate these decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters lam is focused on providing solutions to meet or exceed the changing process control requirements including service and software products 

our etch products and services are defined around the alliance ® and 2300™ etch series platforms 

dielectric etch products 

  exelan ®  exelan high performance exelan hpt 2300 exelan and 2300 exelan flex™ systems  the exelan family of products improves productivity and lowers the cost of ownership for our customers these systems based on lam’s patented dfc technology can be extended to keep pace with the semiconductor industry’s roadmap for etching smaller features and newer dielectric materials exelan was introduced to meet the requirements for manufacturing copper conductive lines using dual damascene etch schemes exelan has been extended through a series of performance improvement upgrades exelan high performance and exelan hpt to meet the etch requirements for the sub130 nm technology node the 2300 exelan which was introduced to address the industry’s transition to 300 mm wafers is a 200 mm and 300 mm capable product the 2300 exelan flex extends the capability of the 2300 exelan family of products to address the requirements for the 65 nm and below technology node 

conductor etch products 

  tcp ® 9400 and tcp ® 9600 series and 2300 versys ® series systems  the first tcp products were introduced in late 1992 they use lam’s patented transformer coupled plasma™ source technology a highdensity lowpressure plasma source that can etch features for the 130 nm and below technology nodes for 200 mm wafer sizes we offer the tcp ® 9400ptx and tcp ® 9400dfm for silicon etch applications the tcp ® 9400dsie™ for mems microelectromechanical structuresbased deep silicon etch and the tcp ® 9600ptx and tcp ® 9600dfm for metal etch applications these systems are used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices as well as mems 

the 2300 versys system for etching silicon and metal films employs a scaled design of tcp technology to address leadingedge device structure requirements the 2300 versys system has the capability to process 200 mm and 300 mm wafer sizes the 2300 versys star™ silicon etch system enables sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature which provides the critical dimension uniformity required for sub110 nm technology nodes while the 2300 versys kiyo™ enables processing at sub65 nm with demonstrated capability to 45 nm and below 

lam 2300 process chambers can be converted within our customers’ facilities from 200 mm to 300 mm which has the advantage of providing customers with greater flexibility and lower costs this capability combined with an overall system footprint comparable to 200 mm systems allows semiconductor manufacturers to develop integrated circuits using 200 mm wafers instead of more expensive 300 mm wafers and later scale up to 300 mm wafer processing 

resist strip products 

lam offers integrated strip modules that remove the photoresist following metal and silicon etch for both 200 mm and 300 mm manufacturing stripping the resist on the same system prevents exposure to air protecting the wafers from corrosion 

for 65 nm technologies and below resist stripping after ion implantation is becoming a critical step because of the difficulty in fully cleaning resist residues without removing too much of the silicon to address this emerging market lam has extended its successful silicon etch product line used in combination with a microwave resist stripper for both 200 mm and 300 mm processing 

clean products 

  synergy cleaning products  synergy products combine dss™ technology and chemical mechanical cleaning™ cmc™ technology to perform mechanical and chemical cleaning in a singlestep process the synergy integra™ incorporates synergy’s cleaning technology with a platform that can be integrated with other suppliers’ chemical mechanical polishing cmp systems certain integrated systems in the industry are the result of development relationships between lam and cmp suppliers the synergy standalone clean system is used to clean wafers both before and after a range of semiconductor processing steps

research and development 

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to maintain competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to rd programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers 

our rd expenses during fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 were 1941 million 1705 million and 1605 million respectively expenditures are targeted at developing new product areas and continued enhancements to our existing products we believe current challenges for customers in the pre and postetch applications present opportunities for us many of these challenges are new and are a result of the transition to sub 90nanometer device structures we plan to leverage our extensive production experience in etch strip and clean applications into new products and new capabilities for our customers at the 65 45 and 32nanometer nodes 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers’ product needs and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service 

our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers that work closely with individual customers to develop solutions to their processing needs we maintain ongoing support relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of field service personnel in place throughout the united states europe japan korea and asia pacific we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace we have 39 sales and support locations around the world through which technical personnel sell andor service our products 

we offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer the warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to our published specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired 

export sales 

a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences exchange rate fluctuations changes in currency controls and economic and political conditions there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows 

customers 

our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers increasingly customers have established joint ventures alliances and technology licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position in fiscal year 2005 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd accounted for approximately 13 of total revenues in fiscal year 2004 revenues from st microelectronics accounted for approximately 15 of total revenues and in fiscal year 2003 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd accounted for approximately 15 of total revenues 

a material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor manufacturers’ business in turn depends on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand 

backlog 

our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect among other things customer delivery date changes as well as order cancellations we schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers’ delivery requirements included in our systems backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted prices and product specifications have been agreed upon and shipment of systems is expected within one year the spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not exceeding 12 months in calculating backlog amounts 

as of june 26 2005 and june 27 2004 our backlog was approximately 351 million and 403 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments 

we have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we continue to believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in addition the expanded role of outsource providers has required us to implement changes to our supply chain management processes including the adoption of new procedures to effectively manage performance risk we believe that we have implemented adequate oversight procedures even so any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes could adversely affect our customer relationships and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition overall we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments 

certain components and subassemblies included in our products are only obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse shortterm effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our business we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production and cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of august 8 2005 we had approximately 2200 regular fulltime employees 

each of our employees is required to sign an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information and most of our employees have lam stockbased compensation arrangements with us that generally provide for the stockbased award vesting over multiple years all employees are required to sign an acknowledgement that they have read and agree to abide by a statement of standards of business conduct 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions we continue to believe that the ability to offer stock compensation is an important component of our employee retention programs 

competition 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world in order to compete effectively we invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software advancements etc our ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment 

we face significant competition with all of our products and services certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced priceperformance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers or other entities covering products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron ltd and applied materials inc 

patents and licenses 

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately 4 to 17 years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they will not alone determine our success which depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on acceptable terms or at all for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k 

other cautionary statements 

see the discussion of risks in the section of this form 10k entitled item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements which are subject to risks uncertainties and changes in condition significance value and effect our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission see “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report on form 10k  

results of operations 

lam research corporation lam or the company is a major supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the world’s semiconductor industry we actively market and sell product offerings that include singlewafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications wafer cleaning systems and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers 

the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns over recent business cycles the severity of these fluctuations has increased and today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions supply demand and prices for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 

executive summary 

we believe our business model continues to set a standard for the industry our business model is focused on new product development sales and marketing and customer support which are the core competencies of the company 

indicators of customer demand began to improve in our quarter ended september 28 2003 this trend continued through the quarter ended september 26 2004 then declined and stabilized over the course of the march 2005 and june 2005 quarters 

fiscal year 2005 revenues increased 61 compared to fiscal year 2004 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market with particularly strong performance in asia 

the progression in our gross margin of five percentage points from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 was achieved on increased sales volume improvements in product mix and effective asset management 

total operating expenses increased by 482 million or 15 during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 increases in operating expenses were primarily driven by increases in salary and benefits costs for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as increases for incentivebased compensation triggered by higher profits fiscal year 2005 operating expenses included restructuring charges of 142 million in connection with our guaranteed residual value guarantee obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans

new orders and backlog 

new orders entered into backlog during fiscal year 2005 were approximately 

 

unshipped orders in backlog as of june 26 2005 were approximately 351 million the basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect among other things customer delivery date changes as well as order cancellations please refer to “backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our backlog policy 

regional geographic breakdown of new orders is as follows 

 

indicators of customer demand for wafer processing equipment improved in the quarter ended september 28 2003 and continued through the quarter ended september 26 2004 since that time new orders have declined and stabilized in the march 2005 and june 2005 quarters which reflects the investment decisions of our customers 

we expect new orders for the quarter ending september 25 2005 to range from flat to down 5 compared with the quarter ended june 26 2005 this expectation is a forwardlooking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue 

 

revenue increased significantly during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 this increase reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers we believe we have gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market with particularly strong performance in asia our deferred revenue 

balance was 1505 million as of june 26 2005 the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately 53 million as of june 26 2005 these shipments are classified as inventory and carried at cost 

the increase in revenues for fiscal year 2005 continued the trends noted for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 which were reflective of a market environment that had improved evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers 

regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows 

 

the overall asia region has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity for semiconductor manufacturing is shifting toward this region this trend continued through fiscal year 2005 the growth in asia pacific revenues during fiscal year 2004 predominantly occurred in taiwan and singapore 

our current estimate for revenues for the quarter ending september 25 2005 ranges from 310 million to 330 million this is a forwardlooking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

gross margin 

 

the increase in gross margin during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven primarily by improved product mix and effective asset management on higher sales volume the increase in gross margin during fiscal year 2004 compared with fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to improved utilization of factory and field resources expense management programs and improved sales volumes throughout the year 

we expect that gross margin as a percent of total revenue will be approximately 47 for the quarter ending september 25 2005 which includes approximately 3 million or one percentage point in stockbased compensation expense associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r this expectation is a forwardlooking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

 

we continue to invest significantly in research and development in business cycle upturns and downturns our investments have been aimed at strengthening our product and services portfolio via the introduction of nextgeneration products as well as enhancing our existing offerings the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 is primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately 5 million for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly 9 million for incentivebased compensation triggered by higher profits the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in rd supplies expense of approximately 6 million approximately 51 of fiscal year 2005 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years 

the growth in spending between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately 10 million a result of planned increases of employee compensation and incentivebased compensation triggered by higher profits these costs were partially offset by reductions in facilitiesrelated expenses largely reflected in reduced depreciation costs of roughly 2 million due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation 

selling general and administrative 

 

the increase in sga expenses during the year ended june 26 2005 compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately 5 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly 14 million due to incentivebased compensation triggered by higher profits also included in the increase was approximately 10 million in professional services which included among other items expenditures for certain discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the company these increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal year 2005 of a net 8 million tax refund from the california state board of equalization for previously paid sales and use tax and approximately 3 million in stockbased compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2004 in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option award 

expenses in fiscal year 2004 were 13 million higher than fiscal year 2003 because employee compensation costs increased by nearly 12 million a result of planned increases of employee compensation and incentivebased compensation triggered by higher profits also contributing to the fiscal year 2004 sga expense growth was a rise in outside services of approximately 5 million primarily due to costs incurred for discretionary information technology projects additionally the 3 million stockbased compensation charge noted above contributed to the increase in fiscal year 2004 a decrease of approximately 4 million primarily in depreciation expense due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation partially offset the rise in expenses noted above 

we expect total operating expenses rd and sga in the quarter ending september 25 2005 will be approximately 100 million which includes an estimated 6 million of stockbased compensation expense associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r these estimates are forwardlooking statements and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring charges 

we distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product facility or service 

we have historically developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to the high level of volatility and at times depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry we systematically reviewed our revenue outlook and forecasts and assessed their impact on required employment levels facilities utilization and outsourcing activities scope based on these evaluations our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended march 28 2004 the march 2004 plan december 28 2003 the december 2003 plan september 28 2003 the september 2003 plan june 29 2003 the june 2003 plan march 30 2003 the march 2003 plan december 29 2002 the december 2002 plan december 30 2001 the december 2001 plan and september 23 2001 the september 2001 plan 

prior to the end of each quarter noted above we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective plan severance packages to potentially impacted employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit the termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced the amount of remaining future lease payments recorded in the restructuring charges include facilities for which a contract was terminated in accordance with its terms and charges for facilities or a portion of facilities we ceased to use expenses were based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based in part on the opinions of independent real estate experts leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off where these items were determined to have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned 

as of june 26 2005 the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following 

 

the severance and benefitsrelated balance is anticipated to be utilized by the end of calendar year 2005 the facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2011 

fiscal year 2005 activity 

during the quarter ended march 27 2005 we recognized additional liabilities of 142 million in connection with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans the 142 million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed residual value of 174 million less 32 million previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities during the march 2005 quarter we contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale we concluded under the provisions of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” that the likelihood that a liability had been incurred was probable and estimable this transaction resulted in an increase of 102 million and 40 million to our fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2002 restructuring plans accruals respectively during the quarter ended june 26 2005 we received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the same quarter the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer we exited these leases to avoid future cash expenditures for these facilities which had been abandoned in prior periods pursuant to the lease and participation agreements our obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer was 274 million the net proceeds of the sale equal to approximately 100 million were applied against this obligation the remainder of the obligation our remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately 174 million was paid during the quarter ended june 26 2005 this transaction is reflected in the fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2002 restructuring plan accrual tables below 

fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities 

our fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce by less than 40 employees primarily in north america and europe and by vacating selected facilities located in north america and asia deemed to be no longer necessary to our operations the employees were from a range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization 

we recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year 2004 of approximately 67 million consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of 12 million charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of 28 million and the writeoff of related leasehold improvements of 16 million we also recorded a charge of approximately 10 million due to the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in japan and 21 million for the writeoff of related leasehold improvements 

we recognized 19 million of additional facilitiesrelated expenses due to changes in estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal year 2004 charges during the year were partially offset by the recovery of 15 million of previously accrued expenses related to the remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in japan additional offsetting items include recovery of 07 million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs and 17 million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to our installed base of certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of our september 2001 restructuring the inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold 

as a result of the fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities we expected quarterly savings relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities in total expenses of approximately 03 million from the march 2004 plan 07 million from the december 2003 plan and 05 million from the september 2003 plan the majority of the savings were expected to be realized within operating expenses mainly selling general and administrative expenses these estimated savings from the plans’ discrete actions were primarily related to lower employee payroll rent and depreciation expenses actual savings may vary from these forecasts depending upon future events and circumstances such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts through june 26 2005 we believe actual savings from these plans are largely consistent with original estimated quarterly savings 

the fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of 102 million in the table below is for the additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in fiscal year 2005 activity 

the following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year 2004 restructuring plans 

 

fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities 

our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal year 2003 through our june 2003 march 2003 and december 2002 plans and recorded restructuring charges during fiscal year 2003 of approximately 181 million our fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce in north america europe and asia by approximately 200 people and vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in north america europe and asia deemed to be no longer required for our operations the employees included in the plans were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization with the majority of the reductions in north america 

the 181 million restructuring charges consisted of 57 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees and 124 million of facilitiesrelated charges the facilitiesrelated charges consisted of the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities a loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and the writeoff of related leasehold improvements in june 2003 a lease covering one of our vacated facilities at our fremont california campus was amended combined restated and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure at the time of the amendment the leased facility’s fair value was less than its original cost by approximately 1 million accordingly this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the 181 million of restructuring charges 

as a result of the fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities we expected quarterly savings relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities of approximately 10 million from the june 2003 plan 10 million from the march 2003 plan and 30 million from the december 2002 plan the majority of the savings were expected to be realized within operating expenses mainly selling general and administrative expenses these estimated savings were primarily from lower payroll facilities and depreciation expenses through june 26 2005 we believe realized savings are consistent with original forecasts however other factors may significantly influence our future cost structure and consequently partially or totally offset savings from these plans 

the following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year 2003 restructuring plans 

 

fiscal year 2002 restructuring activities 

our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal year 2002 through our december 2001 and september 2001 plans and recorded restructuring charges during fiscal year 2002 of approximately 548 million our fiscal year 2002 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce in north america europe and asia by approximately 1020 people vacating selected facilities at our fremont california campus deemed to be no longer required for our operations the closure of certain offices in asia and discontinuance of the manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines the employees were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization with approximately 83 from north america and approximately 17 from europe and asia locations 

the restructuring charges included 250 million in severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees 114 million in charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities 108 million in writeoffs of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets and 76 million in inventory writedowns the inventory charge of approximately 76 million related to our decision to discontinue manufacture of specific systems within our etch product lines we recovered approximately 17 million during fiscal year 2004 10 million during fiscal year 2003 and 07 million during fiscal year 2002 from unanticipated subsequent sales of these inventories to our installed base we physically disposed of approximately 10 million of this inventory during fiscal year 2004 and 27 million during fiscal years 2003 and 2002 during fiscal year 2002 we also recovered approximately 10 million of the 548 million due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of 07 million and lower than planned expenses related to a vacated facility of 03 million during fiscal year 2004 we recorded approximately 04 million of additional restructuring charges due to a revision in estimates for one of our vacated facilities and we recovered approximately 14 million net due to the difference between costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement for a facility for which we entered into a lease cancellation agreement during fiscal year 2004 

during fiscal year 2003 we recovered approximately 27 million for benefits offered that were not utilized by terminated employees and 20 million was recovered due to revisions to the net amount of lease payments remaining on vacated facilities we also recorded additional restructuring charges during fiscal year 2003 of 31 million due to revisions we made in sublease assumptions for two of our vacated buildings in fremont california 01 million due to additional facility restoration costs and 04 million for revisions that we made in our estimates for employee termination costs 

the fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of 40 million in the table below is for the additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in fiscal year 2005 activity 

the following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year 2002 restructuring plans 

 

fiscal year 2001 restructuring activities 

during the second quarter of fiscal year 2003 we completed the remaining elements of our restructuring activities under the june 2001 plan a final 11 million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs the remaining 05 million facilities balance as of june 26 2005 is expected to be paid by january 2006 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 81 million 45 million and 103 million in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively and consisted of the following 

 

the sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was due primarily to the increase in interest rate yields interest expense and debt issue cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our convertible subordinated 3000 million 4 notes 4 notes in june 2004 we elected to make charitable contributions of 55 million during fiscal year 2005 

during fiscal year 2004 our total cash balances which consisted of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash increased each quarter through march 2004 these increases in cash balances allowed us to repay in the june 2004 quarter our 4 notes prior to maturity although cash balances increased throughout the first three quarters of the year interest income decreased during fiscal year 2004 as a result of lower market rates the decline in interest expense and debt issue cost amortization in fiscal year 2004 is largely due to the redemption of our 5 3000 million subordinated debentures 5 notes in september 2002 

tax expense benefit 

our annual income tax expense benefit was 998 million 277 million and 79 million in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the fiscal year 2005 tax rate was 25 which primarily reflects the impact of rd tax credits and the proportion of foreign income taxed at lower than us statutory tax rates in fiscal year 2004 we released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required this resulted in a 127 million credit recorded to income tax expense during fiscal year 2004 in april 2003 the internal revenue service irs closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended june 30 1998 resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to rd tax credits resulting in our recording a 249 million tax benefit in june 2003 in addition a tax expense of approximately 170 million associated with implementing strategies to in the longerterm limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in june 2003 

deferred income taxes 

we had gross deferred tax assets arising from nondeductible temporary differences net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards of 2480 million and 3033 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 the gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of 1060 million and 678 million and deferred tax liabilities of 222 million and 263 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances if any our current valuation allowance of 1060 million includes the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options when the stock option tax benefits are realized a portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value during fiscal year 2004 we released a valuation allowance of 127 million as discussed above 

on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law the ajca provides for a deduction of 85 of certain nonus earnings that are repatriated to the us as defined in the ajca on january 13 2005 and may 10 2005 the us treasury published notice 200510 and notice 200538 respectively providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction based on our current understanding of the ajca we believe the range of possible amounts that we may consider for repatriation under this provision is between zero and 500 million the potential range of related income tax that may be incurred as a result of the repatriation is between zero and 26 million we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal year 2006 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluated them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 

the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  revenue recognition  we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have completed our system installation obligations received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or 

customer acceptance obligations in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract 

  inventory valuation  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale when the terms of sale do not specify we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance 

standard costs are reassessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts currently obtainable assembly and test labor performance levels and overhead for internally manufactured products manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 

  warranty  typically the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer when appropriate we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability trends all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping 

actual warranty expenses are incurred on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified accordingly actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred and at the same time additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded 

we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 

in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 

  stockbased compensation — employee stock purchase plan and employee stock incentive plans  we account for our employee stock purchase plan espp and stock option plans under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb no 25 and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 44 “accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation — an interpretation of apb opinion no 25” and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” which amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” our espp is a noncompensatory plan and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb no 25 please see “recent accounting pronouncements” below regarding the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r which will become effective during our quarter ending september 25 2005 

pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable in addition the blackscholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option 

  income taxes  deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 

we provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the company the level of rd spending the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed we carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate if necessary if actual results differ from estimates we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate which could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in march 2004 the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf 0301 the consensus clarifies the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either availableforsale or heldtomaturity under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method in september 2004 the fasb issued a final fasb staff position fsp eitf issue 03011 which indefinitely delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of eitf 0301 we are currently evaluating the impact if any of adopting eitf 0301 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs — an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 43 chapter 4” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage we are required to adopt sfas no 151 in fiscal year 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” this statement is a revision of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and its related implementation guidance in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 sab no 107 which provides the staff’s views regarding interactions between sfas no 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies sfas no 123r requires that compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued sfas no 123r will be effective for us beginning with the quarter ended september 25 2005 the effects of the adoption of sfas no 123r on our results of operations and financial position are dependent upon a number of factors including the number of employee stock options outstanding and unvested the number of stockbased awards which may be granted in the future the life and vesting features of stockbased awards which may be granted in the future the future market value and volatility of our stock movements in the risk free rate of interest award exercise and forfeiture patterns and the valuation model used to estimate the fair value of each award we are currently evaluating these variables in the design of our stockbased compensation program as well as the accounting requirements under sfas no 123r and sab no 107 in addition we intend to utilize restricted stock units as a key component of our ongoing employee incentivebased compensation plan these awards generally are recorded at their fair value equal to the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of issuance and this amount is subsequently amortized ratably over the vesting period of the shares of restricted stock held by the employee based on the expense for our espp our outstanding unvested options and any outstanding unvested restricted stock units we believe that the expense for stockbased compensation for the quarter ending september 25 2005 will range from 8 million to 10 million pretax 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29” the amendments made by sfas no 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged sfas no 153 also eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance sfas no 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 we will apply its provisions prospectively upon adoption and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” this statement replaces apb no 20 and sfas no 3 and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle apb no 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the accounting principle sfas no 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 154 will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have certain obligations some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not to make future payments under various contracts obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below our offbalance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table 

 

operating leases 

we lease most of our administrative rd and manufacturing facilities regional salesservice offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through 2021 certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont california headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation 

included in the operating leases 45 years section of the table above is 750 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our fremont california campus please see the guarantees section below for additional information 

the remaining balances primarily relate to noncancelable facilityrelated operating leases expiring at various dates through 2021 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multiyear periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments including vendorconsigned inventories we continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities including elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities maintenance certain information technology functions and certain transactional general and administrative functions the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 26 2005 under these arrangements and others actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition to minimum spending commitments certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges 

consignment inventories which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined at june 26 2005 vendorowned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were approximately 148 million 

restructuring liabilities 

our total restructuring reserves as of june 26 2005 were 56 million including 02 million of severance and benefitsrelated costs and 54 million related to lease payments on vacated buildings through cash generated from operations we expect 33 million to be paid over the next twelve months and 23 million to be paid between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2011 please see the related discussion in “restructuring activities” within management’s discussion and analysis 

guarantees 

we account for our guarantees in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin no 45 fin no 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued fin no 45 also requires a company the guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 

during fiscal year 2005 we recognized additional liabilities of 142 million in connection with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans the 142 million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed residual value of 174 million less 32 million previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities during fiscal year 2005 we contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale and we received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the same quarter the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer pursuant to the lease and participation agreements our obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer was 274 million the net proceeds of the sale equal to approximately 100 million were applied against this obligation the remainder of the obligation our remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately 174 million was paid in the quarter ended june 26 2005 we exited these leases to avoid future cash expenditures for these facilities which were abandoned in prior periods 

the facilities noted above were among several facilities for which lease agreements were transferred to a new lessor amended combined and restated in march and june of 2003 as part of the lease agreements we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately 850 million we are required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties of up to 750 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 in the case that the leases are not renewed we do not exercise the purchase options the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs we maintain cash collateral of 850 million as part of the lease agreements as of june 26 2005 in separate specified interestbearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet the lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity vie as defined by fasb interpretation 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us 

we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our operating lease agreements including indemnification for various environmental matters we have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications as of june 26 2005 we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees 

we have agreements with two financial institutions that guarantee payment of our japanese subsidiary’s overdraft protection obligation at june 26 2005 the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements was approximately 28 million although our japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under these agreements 

we have an agreement enabling us to sell to a financial institution certain us dollardenominated receivables generated from the sale of our systems subject to recourse provisions we discontinued the use of this program during the quarter ended june 26 2005 and have no current plans to continue usage at june 26 2005 we had no outstanding and uncollected receivables under this agreement 

generally we indemnify under predetermined conditions and limitations our customers for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees 

we offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer the liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system customer and geographic region modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of june 26 2005 we had 8943 million in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash compared with 5419 million at june 27 2004 during fiscal year 2005 cash and cash equivalents increased by 3188 million including cash provided by operating activities of 4259 million partially offset by cash used for investing activities 587 million and cash used for financing activities of 523 million 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 4259 million during fiscal year 2005 consisted of in millions 

 

significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year 2005 include a decrease of 135 million in net accounts receivable reflecting our focus on timely customer payments we discontinued use of our program to sell certain us dollardenominated accounts receivable during the quarter ended june 26 2005 and we have no current plans to continue usage of the program there were no uncollected sold receivables remaining as of june 26 2005 the change in deferred tax assets was primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards deferred profit decreased by 189 million reflecting marginally higher revenues as compared to shipments during fiscal year 2005 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2005 was 587 million and consisted of net purchases of 633 million of shortterm investments and net capital expenditures of 228 million which consisted primarily of engineering equipment restricted cash decreased by 274 million as a result of the closing of the property sale of certain lease facilities discussed in the “guarantees” section above 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2005 was 523 million including stock repurchases of 1671 million partially offset by net proceeds of 1143 million from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases and 05 million of reissuance of treasury stock 

in october 2004 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 250 million of our common stock from the public market or in private purchases the terms of the repurchase program permit us to repurchase shares through september 30 2007 during fiscal year 2005 we repurchased 5855000 shares of common stock at a total price of 1671 million as of june 26 2005 the total amount available for repurchase under this program was 829 million we expect to continue to purchase shares under this program 

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure based upon our current business outlook we believe our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 26 2005 are sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months 

in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products should additional funding be required we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that in the event of such requirements we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business operating results and financial condition as a result of these risk factors as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements no priority or significance is intended or should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations our operating results may be adversely affected because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to 

 

further because a significant amount of our rd and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont california campus natural physical logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities including labor disruptions earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance 

we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of highpriced systems 

system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems can typically range in price from approximately 04 million to 57 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems as a result the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter 

variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably 

fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our financial results 

we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results 

in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products moreover future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of our primary products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by 

 

 

in addition the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than are our competitors that offer additional products as well this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment our business is affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps this might have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 

we have a limited number of key customers 

sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue new orders and profitability as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

strategic alliances may have negative effects on our business 

increasingly semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies often one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment while this could work to our advantage if lam’s equipment becomes the basis for the function or process it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process in the latter case even if lam’s equipment was previously used by a customer that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance 

similarly our customers may team with or follow the lead of educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps if those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines these actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business 

we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers 

we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we have established longterm contracts with many of these suppliers these longterm contracts can take a variety of forms we may renew these contracts periodically in some cases these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers however several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships 

our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 

outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions such as information technology facilities management and certain elements of our finance organization although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in addition the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships andor have a negative effect on our operating results 

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer 

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment 

we are subject to risks associated with our competitors’ strategic relationships and their introduction of new products and we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share 

we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 

we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

in addition our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently or expect to offer they may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 

our future success depends on international sales and the management of global operations 

nonus sales accounted for approximately 84 in fiscal year 2005 82 in fiscal year 2004 and 72 in fiscal year 2003 of our total revenue we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years we are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations and international sales are subject to risks including but not limited to 

 

certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between china taiwan japan and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with china andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asia region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 

we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated assets and forecasted japanese yendenominated revenue and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future however these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over or underhedged on any given transaction moreover by hedging our yendenominated assets with currency forward contracts we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges additionally we currently do not enter into such forward contracts for currencies other than the yen and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we have business such as the payment of wages and leases in other currencies 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates in the valuation of deferred tax assets in tax laws or by material audit assessments which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability further if we elect to repatriate cash held outside the united states pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 our tax rate may increase even if by a lesser amount than without such legislation 

changes in accounting standards for stockbased compensation may adversely affect our operating results our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 

the adoption of sfas no 123r requires us to expense all stockbased compensation provided to employees beginning with our quarter ending september 25 2005 the environment for skilled employees that are knowledgeable about our products and services is a competitive one and we believe that stockbased compensation is an important part of the overall compensation that we offer to attract and retain such employees sfas no 123r will decrease our earnings based on its measure of the value of stockbased compensation there is some risk that the design of our compensation plans is ineffective at balancing our profitability and employee retention objectives moreover as we will be adopting these rules before certain other companies in our industry there may be for some period of time an appearance that our earnings are lower than those of comparable companies that have not yet adopted sfas no 123r which could have a negative effect on our stock price 

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 

if we are unable to adjust the scale of our business in response to rapid changes in demand in the semiconductor equipment industry our operating results and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired 

the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures and in training managing and appropriately sizing our supply chain our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively if we do not adequately meet these challenges our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth 

if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance 

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies which no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock 

the market for our common stock is extremely volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions 

the market price for our common stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors including but not limited to the following 

 

in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our common stock 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business 

we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment to the extent that these information systems are under our control we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to address the outlined risks however security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 

the potential antitakeover effects of our certificate of incorporation may inhibit a change of control desired by some of our stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes issuance of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock our board of directors without further stockholder approval may issue this preferred stock on such terms as the board of directors may determine which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of lam the issuance of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock including causing the loss of voting control moreover section 203 of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with “interested stockholders” as defined by that statute such factors might deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers even if such takeover proposals or control changes could improve our shortterm stock price 

intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability 

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results moreover although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur 

we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights which would affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise continuing our development of new systems increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers however we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications in addition the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages 

we are subject to the internal control evaluation and attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required beginning with our fiscal year ended june 26 2005 to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year furthermore our independent registered public accounting firm firm is required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year we have successfully completed our assessment and obtained our firm’s attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 26 2005 in future years if we fail to timely complete this assessment or if our firm cannot timely attest to our assessment we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control in addition any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations 

our independent registered public accounting firm must confirm its independence in order for us to meet our regulatory reporting obligations on a timely basis 

our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the firm and lam that in the firm’s professional judgment might have a bearing on the firm’s independence with respect to us if for whatever reason our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of lam based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio we maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk the table below presents principal amounts and related weightedaverage interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at june 26 2005 and june 27 2004 

 

we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues in japan that are denominated in japanese yen and certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies the majority of our expenses are denominated in us dollars except for expenses related to our non us sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency as a result we believe that our primary exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation is naturally hedged the revenue in local currency partially offsets the exposure to local currency expenses except for our japanese yen revenue exposure in japan for this reason we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts we defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of japanese yendenominated receivable balances the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 

on june 26 2005 the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was 326 million the unrealized loss on the contracts on june 26 2005 was 04 million a 15 appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of 58 million depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately 15 would result in an unrealized gain of 42 million on june 26 2005 the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was 662 million a 15 appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of 117 million depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately 15 would result in an unrealized gain of 86 million

 item 9a controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by exchange act rule 13a15b as of the close of fiscal year june 26 2005 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer along with our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control—integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 26 2005 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included at the end of part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

effectiveness of controls 

while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control moreover we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100 effective all of the time accordingly a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 




 item 9b other information 

termination of lease supplements under master lease in connection with transfer of properties by lessor 

on june 10 2005 lam filed a form 8k disclosing that it had received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase two properties at its fremont california campus lam had vacated these properties in connection with previously disclosed restructuring plans the properties being purchased were two of four properties leased by lam from selco services corporation under the amended and restated master lease and deed of trust dated as of june 1 2003 between selco as lessor and lam as lessee the “ master lease ” and the related participation agreement among lam selco and key equipment finance inc formerly known as key corporation capital inc as lender and administrative agent 

at the closing of the sale of the two properties which occurred on june 21 2005 the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer and lam was released from its obligations under the june 2003 lease agreements with respect to the properties covered by lease supplements no 4 no 5 no 6 and no 7 each dated as of june 1 2003 between lam and the lessor the remaining june 1 2003 lease agreements shall continue in effect with respect to the two properties remaining subject to the master lease

etch process the etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic and submicroscopic features on integrated circuits plasma etching was developed to meet the demand for device geometries smaller than 3 microns plasma consists of charged and neutral species that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric metal or polysilicon material and produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of creating 130110 nm features for currentgeneration products and below 110 nm for future semiconductor products at this time the technology node transition accompanies a conversion from aluminum to copper conductive lines to enhance device speeds and the implementation of more fragile insulating dielectric materials low k and porous low k in addition to these changes advanced manufacturing facilities are now producing integrated circuits on 300 mm 12 inch silicon wafers while other facilities use wafer diameters of 200 mm 8 inch and smaller semiconductor manufacturers will continue to require more precise control over the etching process in order to accommodate these decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters one clear focus for the differentiation of lam’s products and services from those of our competitors will be the extent to which we can meet these changing process control requirements our etch products and services are defined around the alliance ® and 2300™ etch series platforms dielectric etch products   exelan ®  exelan high performance exelan hpt and 2300 exelan systems the exelan family of products utilizes lam’s patented dfc technology to create smaller feature sizes and mixes sequential etch process steps in the same chamber these integrated capabilities developed by lam improve productivity and lower the cost of ownership for our customers exelan was introduced in july 1999 to define the structures required for manufacturing copper conductive lines in semiconductors utilizing traditional insulating dielectric films exelan high performance introduced in 2001 extends exelan’s capabilities for etching newer low k insulating dielectric films exelan hpt introduced early in 2002 targets sub130 nm geometries the 2300 exelan family of products addresses process requirements to sub65 nm for 200 mm and 300 mm wafer sizes conductor etch products   tcp ® 9400 and tcp ® 9600 series and 2300 versys ® series systems the first tcp products were introduced in late 1992 they use lam’s patented transformer coupled plasma™ source technology a highdensity lowpressure plasma source that can etch features well below 110 nm for 200 mm wafer sizes we offer the tcp ® 9400ptx and tcp ® 9400dfm for silicon etch applications and the tcp ® 9600ptx and tcp ® 9600dfm for metal etch applications these systems are used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices with feature sizes down to 130110 nm the 2300 versys system for etching silicon and metal films employs a scaled design of tcp technology to address leadingedge device structure requirements the 2300 versys system has the capability to process 200 or 300 mm wafer sizes the 2300 versys star™ silicon etch system enables sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature which provides the critical dimension uniformity required for sub65 nm geometries lam 2300 compatible process chambers can be converted within our customers’ facilities from 200 mm to 300 mm which has the advantage of providing customers with greater flexibility and lower costs this capability combined with an overall system footprint comparable to 200 mm systems allows semiconductor manufacturers to develop integrated circuits using 200 mm wafers instead of expensive 300 mm wafers and later scale up to 300 mm wafer processing 3

export sales a significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the united states and therefore may be subject to certain risks including tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus operations adverse tax consequences exchange rate fluctuations and difficulties in accounts receivable collection there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows customers our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers increasingly customers have established joint ventures alliances and technology licensing arrangements which has potential to positively and negatively impact our competitive position in fiscal year 2004 revenues on a standalone basis from st microelectronics accounted for approximately 15 of total revenues and in fiscal year 2003 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd accounted for approximately 15 of total revenues no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in fiscal 2002 a material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand backlog company unshipped orders backlog at any point in time includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect among other things customer delivery date changes as well as order cancellations we schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers’ delivery requirements included in our systems backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted prices have been agreed upon and shipment of systems is expected within one year the spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not exceeding 12 months in calculating backlog amounts as of june 27 2004 and june 29 2003 our backlog was approximately 403 million and 239 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods manufacturing our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components subassemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to our customers most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments starting in fiscal 2002 we entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we continue to believe that entering into these outsourcing contracts provides us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and are securing their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in addition the expanded role of outsource providers has required us to implement changes to our existing supply chain management functions including the adoption of new procedures to effectively manage performance risk we believe that we have implemented adequate oversight procedures even so any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes could adversely affect our customer relationships and 5 

have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments as is often the case in the high technology industry due to limited availability of suppliers of certain proprietary or patented technologies a minority of the components and subassemblies included in our products are only obtained from a single supplier we believe that in many cases alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have an adverse shortterm effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships environmental matters we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our business we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production and cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities employees as of august 29 2004 we had approximately 2200 regular fulltime employees each of our employees signs an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information and most of our employees have lam stock or stock option arrangements with us that generally provide for the vesting of their options over multiple years in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions we continue to believe that the ability to offer compensation in the form of stock options or similar plans is an important component of our employee retention programs competition the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world in order to compete effectively we must invest significant financial resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software automation etc our ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into a semiconductor production line as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment we face significant competition with all of our products certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price performance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering etch or products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers 6 

could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future our primary competitors in the etch market are tokyo electron limited and applied materials inc patents and licenses our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately 5 to 17 years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they will not alone determine our success which depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on acceptable terms or at all from time to time we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by our products in such cases it is our policy to defend the claims or if considered appropriate negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms however no assurance can be given that we will be able in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k other cautionary statements see the discussion of risks in the section of this report entitled item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 7

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements which are subject to risks uncertainties and changes in condition significance value and effect our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission see “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report on form 10k results of operations lam research corporation lam or the company is a major supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the world’s semiconductor industry we actively market and sell product offerings that include singlewafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications wafer cleaning systems and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns over the past three business cycles the severity of these fluctuations has increased and today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions supply demand and prices for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results strengthening demand that we had noted early in fiscal 2004 and our belief that we are gaining market share manifested themselves in the progression of our quarterly revenues we have continued to focus on our systems and service competitiveness and the implementation of strategies aimed at achieving a more variable cost structure these efforts combined with higher volumes are illustrated by gross margin improvements year over year including both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we decided to cease further investment in cmp systems development this decision was based on the conclusion that the product did not demonstrate sufficient advantages to garner the market share necessary for adequate returns on further investment also during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we repaid in full our convertible subordinated 4 notes 4 notes two years prior to maturity and we settled our interest rate swap agreement the swap which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our fixed rate 4 notes 15 

we continue to invest significantly in research and development to strengthen our product and service offerings and competitive position increases in operating expenses during fiscal 2004 were primarily due to a growth in salary and benefits costs a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentivebased benefits triggered by higher profits in addition spending increased during fiscal 2004 for discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the company these costs have been partially offset by a decrease in facilitiesrelated expenses as a result of infrastructure rationalization and consolidation total revenue  

the increase in revenues for fiscal year 2004 compared to the prior year is reflective of a market environment that has improved evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers signs of improvement in demand for wafer processing equipment noted early in 2004 continued through the year these improvements in demand as well as our belief of market share gains are evidenced by the progression of our quarterly revenues the overall increase in our revenues is influenced by increased demand system installation cycles and customer acceptances our current estimate for revenues for the september 2004 quarter is approximately 400 to 415 million the decrease in revenue for fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 reflected our customers’ response to excess capacity in the semiconductor industry which was significantly influenced by the retrenchment of the global economy and levels of enduser demand for products servicing telecommunications computer and consumer electronics markets semiconductor manufacturers selectively invested in leadingedge technology equipment through fiscal 2003 overall demand remained relatively flat during fiscal 2003 based on the guidance provided by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” as amended by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 104 sab 104 “revenue recognition” we generally recognize new systems revenue when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations refer to our discussion of “critical accounting policies” within this document for additional information about our revenue recognition policy where customer acceptance provisions exist the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is typically determined based on the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment to agreed standards and specifications in accordance with sab 104 in situations with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items on average revenue recognition for systems normally occurs from two to five months after the date of shipment spares and system upgrade revenues are generally recognized on the date of shipment and service revenues are generally recognized upon performance of the activities requested by the customer including training and extended warranty support 16 

regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows  

the asia pacific region has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity for semiconductor manufacturing is located within this region this trend has continued the growth in asia pacific revenues during fiscal year 2004 predominantly occurred in taiwan and singapore the fiscal 2003 increase in asia pacific revenues reflected expanded foundry capabilities and investments by certain of our customers to support the introduction of latestgeneration integrated circuit manufacturing gross margin  

we have continued to focus on systems design to achieve more efficient purchasing and installation processes our performance is evidenced by six successive quarters’ progression of gross margin as a percent of total revenues the increase in gross margin as a percent of total revenues of approximately six percentage points in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is primarily due to improved utilization of factory and field resources expense management programs and improved sales volumes throughout the year fiscal 2004 gross margin includes 24 million of asset impairment charges related to our discontinuance of work on cmp systems development as discussed earlier in the introductory paragraph within “results of operations” in this section during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 we recovered and recorded in cost of goods sold 17 million and 10 million respectively from unanticipated sales of certain inventories previously written off as part of our september 2001 restructuring we expect that gross margin as a percent of total revenue will be approximately 50 during the september 2004 quarter the primary objectives of our strategy to outsource manufacturing activities included a plan to avoid future fixed cost infrastructure and to achieve a more variable cost structure by establishing transactionbased pricing agreements with vendors in addition we have realized opportunities to achieve lower material and assembly costs through improved systems design and leverage from a more focused supplier base our restructuring plans combined with ongoing cost management activities have supported improved utilization rates in our manufacturing and customer support operations also contributing to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the two most recent fiscal years the manufacturing assembly outsourcing model has required fundamental changes within the supply chain and within our business processes one objective of this strategy is to minimize certain costs related to holding inventories and managing product lifecycles in this context we had incurred incremental excess and obsolete inventory charges of 241 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2002 and 59 million of inventory restructuring expenses the charges in fiscal 2002 reflected the known and anticipated impact of the downturn on our business at that point in time the reduction in excess and obsolete inventory costs in fiscal 2003 reflects more stability in 17 

quarteronquarter business levels during the year and our continued emphasis on the minimization of costs discussed above approximately 5 percentage points of yearoveryear improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2003 reflects the 388 million of charges to cost of goods sold related to a patent litigation settlement in fiscal 2002 in the second fiscal quarter of 2002 we signed a final settlement agreement in connection with a patent infringement claim by varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian we agreed to pay varian 200 million in cash and issued them a warrant to purchase 2000000 shares of our common stock with a fair value of 215 million in connection with this settlement we recorded a charge of 388 million in fiscal 2002 and the remaining amount of the settlement 27 million represented the value of future licensed use of patents we received the 27 million relating to the license was amortized ratably over the subsequent 10 quarters as a charge to cost of goods sold the 27 million license was fully amortized at june 27 2004 research and development  

to better position ourselves competitively we continue to invest significantly in research and development aiming at strengthening our product and services portfolio via the introduction of nextgeneration products as well as enhancement of our existing offerings approximately 65 of fiscal 2004 systems revenues are derived from products introduced over the previous two years the decrease in expenses as a percent of total revenues is due to increased sales volumes as our fiscal year 2004 revenue growth was nearly four times our rd expense growth rate the growth in spending between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately 10 million a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentivebased benefits triggered by higher profits approximately 2 million of the overall increase occurred throughout several categories and was due primarily to the increase in business activity these costs were partially offset by reductions in facilitiesrelated expenses largely reflected in reduced depreciation costs of roughly 2 million due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation we do not expect that our decision to cease further investment in cmp systems development will have a significant impact on future rd expense levels spending in fiscal 2003 decreased compared to fiscal 2002 and included a reduction in employeerelated expenses and supplies expenses of approximately 6 million and lower infrastructure costs principally reflected in reduced depreciation and amortization of another 6 million fiscal 2002 expenses included approximately 5 million related to impairment charges and writedowns in the value of selected laboratory equipment which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes the increase in rd expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is the result of the lower sales volume in fiscal 2003 18 

selling general and administrative  

significant increases in profits during fiscal 2004 supported the company increasing employee compensation in fiscal year 2004 by nearly 12 million a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentivebased benefits triggered by higher profits also contributing to the fiscal 2004 sga expense growth was a rise in outside services of approximately 5 million primarily due to costs incurred for discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the company a decrease of approximately 4 million primarily in depreciation expense due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation partially offset the rise in expenses noted above infrastructure rationalization and consolidation including reduced facilities contributed the majority of the annual cost reduction from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 in addition sga expenses in fiscal 2002 included a 42 million impairment charge related to the writedown in value of certain demonstration equipment used in sales and marketing activities which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes we expect total operating expenses will be approximately 95 million during the september 2004 quarter restructuring charges we have developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to the high level of volatility and at times depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry the frequency of our restructuring plans has been driven by the unpredictable and substantial changes in the semiconductor industry as a whole and the market for semiconductor processing equipment in particular these dynamic changes in the semiconductor industry and our business have required multiple integrated responses including those activities within our restructuring plans based on the best information and industryexpert forecasts available at that point in time although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan the extreme nature of our industry’s business cycles and the rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective the implementation of restructuring activities and recognition of their impact in our financial statements does not preclude similar but unrelated actions from being necessary in future periods we systematically review our revenue outlook and forecasts and assess their impact on required employment levels facilities utilization and outsourcing activities based on these evaluations our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended march 28 2004 the march 2004 plan december 28 2003 the december 2003 plan september 28 2003 the september 2003 plan june 29 2003 the june 2003 plan march 30 2003 the march 2003 plan december 29 2002 the december 2002 plan december 30 2001 the december 2001 plan and september 23 2001 the september 2001 plan prior to the end of each quarter noted above we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective plan severance packages to potentially impacted employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit the termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced the amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based in part on the opinions of independent real estate experts leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off as these items will have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned we distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans restructuring activities 19 

have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product facility or service as of june 27 2004 the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following  

the severance and benefitsrelated costs are anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2005 the facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2010 fiscal 2004 restructuring activities we recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year 2004 of approximately 67 million consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of 12 million charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of 28 million and the writeoff of related leasehold improvements of 16 million we also recorded a charge of approximately 10 million for the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in japan and 21 million for the writeoff of related leasehold improvements furthermore we recognized 19 million of additional facilitiesrelated expenses due to changes in estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal 2004 charges during the year were partially offset by recovery of 15 million net of previously accrued expenses related to the remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in japan additional offsetting items include recovery of 07 million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs and 17 million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to our installed base of certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of our september 2001 restructuring the inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold as a result of the fiscal 2004 restructuring activities we expect quarterly savings relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities in total expenses of approximately 03 million from the march 2004 plan 07 million from the december 2003 plan and 05 million from the september 2003 plan the majority of the savings are expected to be realized within operating expenses mainly selling general and administrative expenses these estimated savings from the plans’ discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll facilities and depreciation expenses actual savings may vary from these forecasts depending upon future events and circumstances such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts through june 27 2004 we believe actual savings from these plans are largely consistent with original estimated quarterly savings march 2004 plan we recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended march 28 2004 of approximately 30 million consisting of charges for the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in japan deemed to be no longer useful to our operations of 10 million and the writeoff of related leasehold improvements of 20 million 20

below is a table summarizing activity relating to the september 2003 plan  

fiscal 2003 restructuring activities as a result of the fiscal 2003 restructuring activities we expect quarterly savings relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities of approximately 10 million from the june 2003 plan 10 million from the march 2003 plan and 30 million from the december 2002 plan the majority of the savings are expected to be realized within operating expenses mainly selling general and administrative expenses these estimated savings are primarily from lower payroll facilities and depreciation expenses actual results may vary from those anticipated depending upon future events and circumstances such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts through june 27 2004 we believe realized savings are consistent with original forecasts however other factors may significantly influence our future cost structure and consequently partially or totally offset savings from these plans june 2003 plan our june 2003 plan activities included reducing our workforce in north america europe and asia by approximately 30 people and by vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in north america europe and asia deemed to be no longer required for our operations the employees included in the plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization with the majority of the reductions in north america we recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended june 29 2003 of approximately 76 million consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities a loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and the writeoff of related leasehold improvements in june 2003 a lease covering one of the vacated facilities at our fremont california campus was amended combined restated and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure at the time of the amendment the leased facility’s fair value was less than its original cost by approximately 10 million accordingly this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the 67 million facilityrelated restructuring charge 22

december 2002 plan our december 2002 plan activities included reducing our workforce in north america europe and asia by approximately 120 employees and by vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in north america europe and asia deemed to be no longer necessary for our operations the employees included in the plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization with approximately 65 from north america and approximately 35 from europe and asia locations we recorded a restructuring charge of 57 million consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the writeoff of related leasehold improvements during fiscal 2004 23 

we recovered 01 million due to the difference between the costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement related to a facility in japan below is a table summarizing activity relating to the december 2002 plan

unanticipated subsequent sales to our installed base of these items we physically disposed of approximately 10 million of this inventory during fiscal 2004 and 27 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002 during fiscal 2003 approximately 09 million was recovered due to lower employee severance and termination costs of 06 million and lower than planned expenses for vacated facility leases of 03 million in addition we recorded additional charges of 06 million for the september 2001 plan based on a revised estimate of the length of time required to sublease one of our vacated buildings in fremont california during fiscal 2002 we recovered approximately 10 million of the september 2001 plan charge due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of 07 million and lower than planned expenses relating to a vacated facility lease of 03 million fiscal 2001 restructuring plans during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 we completed the remaining elements of our restructuring activities under the june 2001 plan a final 11 million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs other income expense net other income expense net was 45 million 103 million and 82 million in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively and consisted of the following  

during fiscal 2004 our total cash balances which consist of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash increased each quarter through march 28 2004 these increases in cash balances allowed us to repay in the june 2004 quarter our 4 notes prior to maturity as discussed below although cash balances increased throughout the first three quarters of the year interest income decreased during fiscal 2004 as a result of lower market rates the decline in interest expense and debt issue cost amortization in fiscal 2004 is largely due to the redemption of our 5 3000 million subordinated debentures 5 notes in september 2002 during the quarter ended june 27 2004 we repaid in full our 4 notes two years prior to maturity the repayment of the 4 notes resulted in a cash outlay of 3030 million which included a redemption premium of 30 million additionally during the same quarter we settled the related interest rate swap agreement the swap which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our 4 notes this settlement resulted in an increase in cash of 109 million and in addition a transfer of 6 million from restricted cash to cash balances as a result of the repayment of the 4 notes and swap settlement we recorded a net gain of 45 million included in other income expense net the 45 million consisted of a 109 million gain related to the swap less the 30 million redemption premium and writeoff of 34 million of unamortized offering expenses associated with the 4 notes 25 

the change in net other expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the settlement of our equity derivative instruments indexed to lam stock and lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates partially offset by lower interest expense due to the redemption of our 5 notes in september 2002 on august 23 2002 we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts by purchasing approximately 35 million shares of lam common stock at an average price of 1119 per share for a total cash payment of 391 million the settlement generated a life to date gain of 84 million 241 per share and we recognized an increase in treasury stock of 476 million as a result of this transaction based on the 1360 market price of our common stock at the contract settlement date august 23 2002 the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by 164 million to 84 million from their june 30 2002 fair value of 248 million this 164 million reduction in the equity derivative contracts’ fair value was recorded as a nontaxable loss in other expense in fiscal 2003 tax expense benefit our annual income tax expense benefit was 277 million 79 million and 379 million in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the losses on equity derivative contracts indexed to our stock in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 of 164 million and 82 million respectively were nondeductible for income tax purposes in april 2003 the internal revenue service irs closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended june 30 1998 resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to rd tax credits resulting in our recording a 249 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 in addition a tax expense of approximately 170 million associated with implementing strategies to in the longerterm limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 these tax strategies are structured to align the asset ownership and functions of our various legal entities around the world with our expectations of the level timing and sources of future revenues and profits in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we increased our tax benefit rate to 30 the increase resulted from the tax benefit of the rd credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pretax income and investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for rd tax benefits deferred tax assets we had gross deferred tax assets arising from nondeductible temporary differences net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards of 3033 million and 2875 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003 the gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of 678 million and 367 million and deferred tax liabilities of 263 million and 307 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances if any outsourcing we define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these activities we have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products to market and sell what we develop and to service and support directly what we sell most other activities in the company are in support of product development marketing and selling and customer service consequently in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties accordingly during fiscal 2002 we began to enter into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities management and information technology functions during fiscal 2003 and 2004 we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional general and administrative functions we believe that entering into these outsourcing programs will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely and efficient manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that historically occurred due to the cyclical nature of our business 26 

related party transactions during fiscal year 2001 our president and chief operating officer signed a promissory note with lam entitling him to borrow up to 10 million dollars at 675 simple interest he was advanced the 10 million and subsequently repaid the entire amount of 10 million plus accrued interest during the quarter ended december 28 2003 critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluated them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex andor subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition  we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and we have completed our system installation obligations received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications in situations with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items revenue related to sales of spare parts system upgrade kits and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount and a term more than one month is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract   inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which approximate actual costs on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale when the terms of sale do not specify we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 27 

standard costs are reassessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts currently obtainable assembly and test labor activities and overhead for internally manufactured products manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made   warranty typically marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we provide standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known factors such as tool reliability improvements all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping actual warranty expenses are incurred on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified accordingly actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred and at the same time additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems historically including the most recent fiscal year ended june 27 2004 all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount and a term of more than one month are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable   employee stock purchase plan and employee stock option plans we account for our employee stock purchase plan espp and stock option plans under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb 25 and interpretation no 44 “accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation — an interpretation of apb opinion no 25” fin 44 and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” sfas 148 which amends statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 our espp is a noncompensatory plan and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb 25 pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable in addition the blackscholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option because our stockbased awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded 28 

options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in management’s opinion the existing option valuation models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stockbased awards to employees   deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed our current valuation allowance of 678 million relates to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options and foreign tax credits when the stock option tax benefits are realized the related deferred tax asset will reverse and a portion of the valuation allowance will also be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not to make future payments under various contracts obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include longterm liabilities and restructuring liabilities which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below our offbalance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table  

  other longterm liabilities during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we signed a final settlement agreement with varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october 1993 under the terms of the settlement agreement varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation we agreed to pay varian 200 million in cash 50 million in december 2001 and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of 125 million over a threeyear period as of june 27 2004 a total amount of 175 million has been paid to varian and the total obligation remaining is 25 million through december 2004 29 

  restructuring liabilities our total restructuring reserves as of june 27 2004 were 139 million including 06 million of severance and benefitsrelated costs and 133 million related to lease payments on vacated buildings through cash generated from operations we expect 51 million to be paid over the next twelve months and 88 million to be paid between fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2010 please see the related discussion in “restructuring charges” within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”   operating leases we lease most of our administrative rd and manufacturing facilities regional salesservice offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through 2021 all of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont california headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation in march and june of 2003 lease agreements relating to properties at our fremont california campus were transferred to a new lessor amended combined and restated as part of the lease agreements we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all properties related to these leases of approximately 1125 million in addition we are required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties of up to 987 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal 2008 in the case that the leases are not renewed we do not exercise the purchase options and the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs at the time of the june amendment one of the leased property’s current fair value was less than its original cost by approximately 10 million the leased property was a building that had been part of our past restructuring activities and the noncash loss was recorded as a restructuring charge during fiscal 2003 as a result we recorded a 10 million liability for the loss on the leased property we maintain cash collateral of 1125 million as part of the lease agreements as of june 27 2004 in separate specified interestbearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet the lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity vie as defined by fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us the 987 million is included in the table above the remaining 313 million primarily relates to noncancelable facilityrelated operating leases expiring at various dates through 2021   purchase obligations purchase obligations consist of material contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multiyear periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments including vendorconsigned inventories we continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain elements including elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities maintenance certain information technology functions and certain transactional general and administrative functions these outsourced services should provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely and efficient manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 27 2004 under these arrangements and others actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition to minimum spending commitments certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges consignment inventories which are owned by vendors but located in our discrete storage locations and warehouses are not reported as lam inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined at june 27 2004 vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as lam inventory were approximately 146 million 30 

guarantees the transferred lease agreements relating to various properties at our fremont california campus and discussed above under “operating leases” require us to guarantee residual values of the leased properties to the lessors at the end of the lease terms of up to 987 million in the case that the leases are not renewed we do not exercise the purchase options the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs the remaining terms of these guarantees four years are equal to the remaining terms of the related lease agreements under the accounting provisions of fin 45 we recognized a liability of approximately 10 million for the related residual value guarantees under these leases this liability determined by computing the present value of estimated probability weighted cash flows to be paid by us over the term of the guarantees was recorded as prepaid rent with the offset recorded as a liability and the amount is being amortized to rent expense for the prepaid rent and to income for the liability on a ratable basis over the fiveyear period of the leases refer to note 16 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this form 10k for further information concerning our guaranteed residual values we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our operating lease agreements such as indemnification for various environmental matters we have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications as of june 27 2004 we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees we have agreements with two financial institutions where our us operating company guarantees payment of our japanese subsidiary’s overdraft protection obligation the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these agreements at june 27 2004 is approximately 56 million the amount available under the overdraft protection agreement as of june 27 2004 our japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under this agreement we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantees as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid we have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain us dollardenominated accounts receivable generated from the sale of our systems subject to recourse provisions we insure these sold receivables for approximately 90 of their value and guarantee payment of the remaining uninsured receivable value in the event that the payment obligation is not satisfied based on historical payment patterns we have experienced negligible default on payment obligations and therefore believe the risk of loss from default is minimal the terms of these guarantees are from 90 days past the due date of the receivable until collected at june 27 2004 the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this agreement is approximately 60 million as of june 27 2004 we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these guarantees as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid generally we indemnify our customers under predetermined conditions and limitations for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales prices of the products or services we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees we provide standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer the liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system customer and geographic region modified for any known factors such as the impact of system reliability improvements see note 16 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this form 10k for changes in our product warranty reserves during fiscal 2004 31 

liquidity and capital resources as of june 27 2004 we had 5419 million in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash compared with 6259 million at june 29 2003 cash provided by operating activities of 1571 million issuance of common stock of 642 million and reissuance of treasury stock of 132 million resulted in net cash increases of 2345 million which enabled us to repay early our 4 notes which resulted in a principal payment of 3000 million additional significant uses of cash included capital expenditures of 240 million on april 1 2004 we settled our swap which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our 4 notes this settlement resulted in an increase in cash of 109 million and in addition a transfer of 60 million from restricted cash to cash balances on june 7 2004 we repaid our 4 notes two years prior to maturity this repayment resulted in a cash outlay of 3030 million including a redemption premium of 30 million additionally we wrote off 34 million of unamortized offering expenses we had a deferred gain of 109 million recorded on the balance sheet in longterm debt and other longterm liabilities related to the swap as a result of the settlement of the swap and the redemption of the 4 notes we recorded a net gain of 45 million included in other income net in our statement of operations the net gain is comprised of the deferred gain noted above less the redemption premium writeoff of unamortized offering expenses and transactionrelated costs during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we signed a final settlement agreement with varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october 1993 under the terms of the settlement agreement varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation we agreed to pay varian 200 million in cash 50 million in december 2001 and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of 125 million over a threeyear period as of june 27 2004 a total amount of 175 million has been paid to varian and the total obligation remaining is 25 million through december 2004 cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 1571 million in fiscal 2004 which consisted of net income for the year of 830 million adjusted for noncash charges of 489 million and sources of working capital of 252 million noncash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization restructuring charges deferred income taxes and the net noncash gain recognized in fiscal 2004 as a result of the early retirement of our 4 notes significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year 2004 include an increase of 1384 million in accounts receivable due to increased sales volumes we have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain us dollardenominated accounts receivable these sales of accounts receivable are intended to accelerate the collection of cash we sold 1587 million of accounts receivable during fiscal 2004 deferred income taxes decreased by 109 million trade payables increased by 578 million due to increased expense levels as a result of improved business volumes and timing of payments accrued liabilities increased by 296 million primarily due to an increase in variable incentivebased compensation as well as a rise in income taxes payable as a result of the significant increase in profits deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue rose by 631 million reflecting significantly increased rates of shipments and the timing of customer acceptances cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2004 was 485 million we sold 669 million net of shortterm investments that contributed to the repayment of our 4 notes in june 2004 net capital expenditures were 240 million and focused on computer equipment and machinery net property and equipment was 424 million at june 27 2004 compared to 488 million at june 29 2003 this decrease is primarily due to 234 million of depreciation expense 38 million in writeoffs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities 24 32 

million in writeoffs related to our decision to cease investment in cmp systems development which together exceed the 240 million in capital expenditures discussed above cash flows from financing activities net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2004 was 2117 million and consisted primarily of the principal repayment of our 4 notes in the amount of 3000 million in connection with the settlement of our interest rate swap agreement we received proceeds of 109 million we also reissued 132 million from treasury stock through our employee stock purchase program and net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises totaled 642 million given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles based upon our current business outlook our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 27 2004 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products should additional funding be required we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities we believe that in the event of such requirements we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives however given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 33 

risk factors our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations our operating results may be adversely affected because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to                  further because a significant amount of our rd and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont california campus natural physical logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities including labor disruptions earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of highpriced systems system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems can typically range in price from approximately 04 million to 48 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems as a result the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues may be subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 34 

the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our financial results we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers suppliers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of our primary products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by      we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 35 

we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we have established longterm contracts with many of these suppliers these longterm contracts can take a variety of forms we may renew these contracts periodically in some cases these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers however several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in addition the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships andor have a negative effect on our operating results once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment we are subject to risks associated with our competitors’ strategic relationships and their introduction of new products and we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide in addition our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently or expect to offer they may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we 36 

may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows our future success depends on international sales and the management of global operations nonus sales as a percentage of total revenue accounted for approximately 82 in fiscal 2004 72 in fiscal 2003 and 71 in fiscal 2002 we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years we are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations and international sales are subject to risks including but not limited to         many of these challenges are applicable in china which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between china taiwan and the united states that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with china andor taiwan and perhaps the entire asiapacific region a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue and profits we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated assets and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities if we are unable to adjust the scale of our business in response to rapid changes in demand in the semiconductor equipment industry our operating results and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending on operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures and in training managing and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively if we do not adequately meet these challenges our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to 37 

meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies which no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows in addition any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock the market for our common stock is extremely volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions the market price for our common stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors including but not limited to the following           in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our common stock 38 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment to the extent that these information systems are under our control we have implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to address the outlined risks however security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business the potential antitakeover effects of our bylaws provisions and the rights plan we have in place may affect our stock price and inhibit a change of control desired by some of our stockholders in 1997 we adopted a rights plan the rights plan in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our common stock held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on january 31 1997 and thereafter in connection with the adoption of the rights plan our board of directors also adopted a number of amendments to our bylaws including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals our rights plan may have certain antitakeover effects our rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire lam in certain circumstances accordingly the existence of the rights plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers the rights plan however is not intended to prevent a takeover rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our board of directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation authorizes issuance of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock our board of directors without further stockholder approval may issue this preferred stock on such terms as the board of directors may determine which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of lam the issuance of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock including causing the loss of voting control moreover section 203 of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with “interested stockholders” as defined by that statute intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement unfair competition or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 39 

we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights which would affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise continuing our development of new systems increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers however we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications in addition the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages compliance with internal control attestation and outside audit firm independence pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we will be required beginning with our fiscal year ending june 26 2005 to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2005 furthermore our independent registered public accounting firm firm will be required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 26 2005 we have not yet completed our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control if we fail to timely complete this assessment or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our assessment we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control in addition any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the firm and the company that in the firm’s professional judgment might have a bearing on the firm’s independence with respect to the company if  for whatever reason our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of the company based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations 40 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and longterm debt obligations we maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk the table below presents principal amounts and related weightedaverage interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio longterm assets and longterm debt obligations at june 27 2004 and june 29 2003  

we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification we had no foreign exchange cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate 4 notes we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates for this reason we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our japanese yendenominated assets the changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income and expense in addition we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts we defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income on june 27 2004 the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was 481 million the unrealized gain on the contracts on june 27 2004 was 01 million a 15 appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of 85 million depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately 15 would result in an unrealized gain of 62 million 41

10k forms 10q and forms 8k and amendments to those reports on our corporate web site at httpwwwlamrccom as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the reports with or furnish them to the sec we design manufacture market and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major supplier of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits our etch and chemical mechanical planarization cmp products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer to create semiconductors we leverage our expertise in these areas to also develop 2 intellectual property ip for integrated processing solutions etch processes which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today our current range of etch systems employ lam’s tcp ® high density and dual frequency confined tm dfc tm  medium density plasma sources to etch device features at current generation geometries and smaller than 100 nanometers nm in size cmp products are used to planarize the surface of the wafer to prepare it for further processing our teres ® cmp products utilize a linear planarization technology for manufacturing complex integrated circuits with features 013 microns 130 nm and smaller with multiple metal layers our 200300mm cmp systems provide integrated polishing and postcmp cleaning solutions etch process the etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic features on integrated circuits plasma etching was developed to meet the demand for device geometries smaller than 3 microns plasma consists of ions and neutral species that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric metal or polysilicon material and produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of creating 013micron features for currentgeneration products and below 100 nm for future semiconductor products the trend toward feature sizes in the 100nm range accompanies a transition from aluminum to copper conductive lines for faster device processing speeds subsequent feature size reductions below 100 nm will begin to integrate more fragile insulating dielectric materials low k and porous low k in between conductive lines in addition to continually shrinking feature sizes advanced manufacturing facilities are now producing integrated circuits on 200mm 8inch silicon wafers as well as on wafer diameters of 300 mm 12 inch to accommodate these decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters semiconductor manufacturers will continue to require more precise control over the etching process several of our etch products are available as standalone one chamber systems or as clusters multichamber systems using the alliance ® or 2300 tm etch series platforms dielectric etch products   4520 series systems the 4520 system processes wafer sizes up to 200 mm   4520xl e tm system  the 4520xl e system introduced lam’s proprietary dfc plasma technology which reduces plasma volume and sidewall polymer accumulation for cleaner lowcost operation additionally it offers a wider process window than the 4520 system with capability to etch geometries below 018 microns   exelan ®  exelan ® high performance exelan ® hpt and 2300 exelan ® systems the exelan family of products extends dfc technology to create smaller feature sizes and mixes sequential etch process steps in the same chamber these integrated capabilities developed by lam improve productivity and lower the cost of ownership for our customers exelan was introduced in july 1999 to define the structures required for manufacturing copper conductive lines in semiconductors utilizing traditional insulating dielectric films exelan high performance introduced in 2001 extends exelan’s capabilities for etching newer low k insulating dielectric films exelan hpt introduced early in 2002 targets sub013 micron geometries the 2300 exelan system addresses process requirements down to sub65 nm for 200mm and 300mm wafer sizes  process chambers can be converted within our customers’ fabrication 3 facilities from 200 mm to 300 mm which has the advantage of providing greater flexibility and lowering costs this capability combined with an overall system footprint comparable to 200mm systems allows semiconductor manufacturers to develop integrated circuits using 200mm wafers instead of expensive 300mm wafers and later scale up to 300mm wafer processing conductor etch products   tcp ® 9400 and tcp ® 9600 series and 2300 versys tm series systems  the first tcp products were introduced in late 1992 they use lam’s patented transformer coupled plasma source technology a highdensity lowpressure plasma source that can etch features well below 100 nm for 200mm wafer sizes we offer the tcp ® 9400ptx and tcp ® 9400dfm for silicon etch applications and the tcp ® 9600ptx and tcp ® 9600dfm for metal etch applications these systems are used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices with feature sizes below 013 microns the 2300 versys system for etching silicon and metal films employs a scaled design of tcp technology to address leadingedge device structure requirements the 2300 versys system has the capability to process 200 or 300mm wafer sizes the 2300 versys star tm silicon etch system enables sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature which provides the critical dimension uniformity required for geometries down to sub65 nm cmp and cmp wafer cleaning processes with increasingly smaller geometries more layers are required to connect the individual devices of an integrated circuit each additional layer exaggerates the uneven topography of the previous ones this effect creates a depthoffocus problem for subsequent photolithographic steps which diminishes the precision of the linewidth dimensions the cmp process removes excess material from the wafer surface by a combination of chemical and abrasive actions to provide a flatter surface improving photolithography results additionally cmp processes are required for the creation of copper conductive lines removing the residue of the abrasive and chemical materials used in cmp requires special cleaning techniques following processing cmp with integrated clean products   teres and 200300mm cmp systems we offer 200mm teres and 200300mm cmp systems with integrated synergy tm based cleaning systems these tools target advanced copperlow k and shallow trench isolation sti applications as well as highproductivity interlayer dielectric ild processes the systems incorporate our linear planarization technology tm lpt tm  which uses a highspeed belt combined with patented airbearing platen capability these features achieve uniformity control across the wafer surface by changing the shape of the belt pad using air pressure independent zones can be adjusted to change the pad pressure instead of bending the wafer backside so that expensive 300mm wafers and fragile multilayer low k film stacks are not unnecessarily stressed during processing standalone clean products   synergy synergy products combine dss ® technology and chemical mechanical cleaning tm cmc tm  technology to perform mechanical and chemical cleaning in a singlestep process the synergy integra tm incorporates synergy’s cleaning technology with a platform that can be integrated with other suppliers’ polishing systems certain integrated systems in the industry are the result of development relationships between lam and other polishing vendors in addition to handling the clean step following cmp applications the synergy standalone clean system is used to clean wafers both before and after a range of semiconductor processing steps 4 lam 2300 4520xl e  chemical mechanical cleaning

extensive network of field service personnel in place throughout the united states europe japan and asia pacific we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace we have 37 sales and support centers around the world through which technical personnel sell andor service our products we provide standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer the warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to our published specifications the warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or likenew equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or nonconformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair we make comprehensive warranty packages on all released products available to our customers export sales export sales accounted for approximately 47 44 and 50 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively export sales consist of sales from any of our us operating subsidiaries to nonaffiliated customers outside the us as a result a significant portion of our sales and operations may be subject to certain risks including tariffs and other barriers difficulties 5 in staffing and managing nonus subsidiary and branch operations potentially adverse tax consequences exchange rate fluctuations and the potential for difficulty in accounts receivable collection there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows refer to note 20 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein for further information concerning export sales customers our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers in fiscal year 2003 revenues from samsung electronics company ltd accounted for approximately 15 of total revenues and in fiscal year 2001 revenues from stmicroelectronics accounted for approximately 15 of our total revenue no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in fiscal 2002 a material reduction in orders from several of our customers due to market or business conditions in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits beginning in the second half of fiscal 2001 a slowing us economy and worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and a severe contraction of the manufacturing equipment market our customers reduced their level of capital expenditures which caused a steep decline in demand for our products in fiscal 2002 and demand has remained relatively flat during fiscal 2003 due to our customers’ continuing cautious posture about their levels of capital expenditures backlog company backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect among other things customer delivery date changes as well as order cancellations we schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers’ delivery requirements included in our systems backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted prices have been agreed upon and shipment of systems is expected within one year the spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided where specific customer service and spare parts purchase contracts do not contain specific delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not exceeding 12 months in calculating backlog amounts as of june 29 2003 and june 30 2002 our backlog was approximately 239 million and 287 million respectively generally orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues for succeeding periods manufacturing our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components and modules that are then integrated into finished systems we are seeing the effects of our outsourcing programs as certain system assemblies and modules are now received by us from third 6 party providers to be incorporated by us into system builds most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments although infrequent prior to shipping a completed system customer representatives may perform system acceptance tests at our facility beginning in fiscal 2002 and continuing in fiscal 2003 we entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that entering into these outsourcing contracts will provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up and down in a more timely and cost effective manner enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and are securing their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in addition the expanded role of outsource providers has required us to implement changes to our existing supply chain management operations and to adopt new procedures to manage effectively the performance of those outsource providers we believe that we have implemented adequate oversight procedures even so any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes could adversely affect our customer relationships and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition refer to note 17 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments as is often the case in the high technology industry due to limited availability of suppliers of certain proprietary or patented technologies certain of the components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we believe that in many cases alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have an adverse shortterm effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships environmental matters we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our business we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities employees as of september 16 2003 we had approximately 2100 regular fulltime employees each of our employees signs an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information and most of our employees have stock or stock option arrangements with us that generally provide for the vesting of their options over multiple years in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the rd and customer support functions we believe that the ability to offer compensation in the form of stock options is an 7 important component of our keyemployee retention programs competition the semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world in order to compete effectively we must invest significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers globally and to develop enhanced product capabilities semiconductor manufacturers will evaluate equipment suppliers in many areas including but not limited to process performance productivity customer support defect control and overall cost of ownership which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design reliability software automation etc our ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new processing equipment into a semiconductor production line as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s tool set and qualified it for production the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s system we face significant competition with all of our products certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price performance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering etch or products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future our primary competitors in the etch market are applied materials inc and tokyo electron limited our cmp integrated polishing system faces significant competition from applied materials inc ebara corp and novellus systems inc patents and licenses our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we hold united states patents and corresponding nonus patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately 6 to 17 years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they will not alone determine our success which depends principally upon our engineering marketing support and delivery skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on acceptable terms or at all from time to time we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by our products in such cases it is our policy to defend the claims or if considered appropriate negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms however no assurance can be given that we will be able in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that any litigation resulting from 8 such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k other cautionary statements see the discussion of risks in

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations lam research corporation lam or the company is a major supplier of semiconductor capital equipment our product offerings include singlewafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications cmp and cmp wafer cleaning systems and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns over the past 3 business cycles their severity has increased and today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns are no more reliable than in prior years demand for our equipment can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions supply demand and price for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop and market competitive products for these and other reasons our results of operations for fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 16 total revenue  the sequential decrease in revenue for fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2002 compared to fiscal year 2001 reflects our customers’ response to excess capacity in the semiconductor industry which was significantly influenced by the continued retrenchment of the global economy and levels of enduser demand for products servicing telecommunications computer and consumer electronics markets semiconductor manufacturers have selectively invested in leadingedge technology equipment through fiscal 2003 and are in the early stages of ramping these new capabilities at production volumes overall demand has remained relatively flat during fiscal 2003 as reflected in the pattern of our quarterly revenues our current estimate for the september 2003 quarter is for revenues to be approximately at the same levels as the june 2003 quarter revenues the downturn that began in the second half of fiscal 2001 resulted in decreased revenues across nearly all product lines in fiscal 2002 the reduction in revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due to a worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits which resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and severe contraction in capital investments we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 effective june 26 2000 based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” refer to our discussion of “critical accounting policies” for additional information about our revenue recognition policy based on the guidance provided by sab 101 we generally recognize new systems revenue upon customer acceptance as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment to agreed standards and specifications after system installation systems revenue recognition generally occurs from two to seven months after the date of shipment spares revenues generally are recognized on the date of shipment and service revenues are recognized generally upon performance of the activities requested by the customer including training upgrades and extended warranty support regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows  the growth of asia pacific revenues reflects expanded foundry operations and investments by memory chip manufacturers to lower their operating costs by introducing latestgeneration manufacturing equipment 17 gross margin  the increase in gross margin as a percent of total revenues of 12 percentage points in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was accomplished with an approximate 20 percent reduction in revenues over the same periods we have focused on implementing strategies to outsource manufacturing activities in order to lower our breakeven point to approximately 180 million in quarterly revenues at the end of fiscal 2003 further outsourcing of manufacturing assembly activities was accomplished throughout fiscal 2003 continuing the trend toward achieving a more variable cost structure by establishing transactionbased pricing agreements with vendors and additionally enabling the elimination of infrastructure costs such as facilities the same strategy has provided opportunities to achieve lower material and assembly costs through improved systems design and leverage from a more focused supplier base the manufacturing assembly outsourcing model has required fundamental changes within the supply chain and within our business processes one objective of this strategy is to minimize certain costs related to holding inventories and managing product lifecycles specifically related to this point in fiscal 2002 we incurred incremental excess and obsolete inventory charges of 241 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2002 and in addition we incurred 59 million of inventory restructuring expenses contributing to approximately a 450 basis points improvement in the gross margin percentage compared to fiscal 2003 the charges in fiscal 2002 reflected the known and anticipated impact of the downturn on our business at that point in time the reduction in excess and obsolete inventory costs in fiscal 2003 reflects more stability in quarter onquarter business levels during the year and other inventory management efforts our current outlook for the september 2003 quarter is for essentially flat gross margin as a percentage of revenues compared to the june 2003 quarter approximately 500 basis points of the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2003 compared to the corresponding period a year ago is a result of 388 million of charges to cost of goods sold related to a patent litigation settlement in fiscal 2002 in the second fiscal quarter of 2002 we signed a final settlement agreement in connection with a patent infringement claim by varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian we agreed to pay varian 200 million in cash and issued varian a warrant to purchase 2000000 shares of our common stock with a fair value of 215 million in connection with this settlement we recorded a charge of 388 million and the remaining amount of the settlement 27 million represented the value of future licensed use of patents we received the 27 million relating to the license will continue to be amortized ratably over the subsequent 10 quarters as a charge to cost of goods sold accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal 2003 was 16 million additionally our restructuring plans combined with ongoing cost management activities have supported improved utilization rates in our manufacturing operations contributing to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 stems from 18 patent litigation settlement charges and obsolete inventory charges within cost of goods sold as well as unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower production volumes in the second fiscal quarter of 2002 we recorded a charge for excess and obsolete inventory of 241 million we recorded the charge based on the results of our customary quarterly analysis of inventories and their net realizable value based on current market conditions and forecasted customer demand for related products this analysis highlighted limited anticipated consumption of our older generation equipment due to accelerated technological and product design changes research and development  the reduction in absolute dollars in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 illustrates ongoing efforts to focus expenditures primarily on the development of critical nextgeneration products spending in fiscal 2003 decreased compared to fiscal 2002 and included a reduction in employeerelated expenses and supplies expenses of approximately 6 million and lower infrastructure costs principally reflected in reduced depreciation and amortization of another 6 million additionally rd expenses in fiscal 2002 of approximately 5 million related to impairment charges and writedowns in the value of selected laboratory equipment which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes the increase in rd expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is the result of the lower sales volume in fiscal 2003 the decrease in rd expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 results from alignment of spending on general rd programs with the downturn in the business cycle approximately 60 of fiscal 2003 systems revenues are derived from products introduced over the previous two years we believe that in order to remain competitive we must continue to invest substantially in engineering and technology development accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to these programs which will result in sizeable levels of investment in nextgeneration products and enhancement of existing products selling general and administrative  the reduction in selling general and administrative sga expenses in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior year reflects the structural change in the targeted administrative functions that have been outsourced reduced salaries and benefits and supply costs have been significantly substituted with variable largely transactionbased pricing from selected providers 19 infrastructure rationalization including reduced facilities has contributed the majority of the annual cost reduction from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 in addition sga expenses in fiscal 2002 included a 42 million impairment charge related to the writedown in value of certain demonstration equipment used in sales and marketing activities which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes in the quarter ended december 29 2002 we modified the contractual life of and added additional vesting requirements to one of our chairman and chief executive officer’s stock option awards as a result of the modification we recorded deferred stockbased compensation of 34 million which is being amortized ratably over the vesting period of the modified options or 16 quarters as of june 29 2003 approximately 28 million remained in deferred compensation within stockholders’ equity as modified the option award provided for accelerated vesting triggered when the nasdaq national market closing price of our common stock reaches or exceeds 2000 per share at such time when vesting is accelerated all unvested shares will immediately vest and become exercisable and all remaining deferred compensation would then be recognized as compensation expense within sga in the quarter ended september 2003 we modified the vesting requirements to this same option award by adding a second condition to the accelerated vesting provision refer to the subsequent event discussion included in this item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the decrease in absolute dollars of sga expenses in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was largely due to manpower reductions lower incentive payments to employees shutdown days and other cost reduction programs in response to the contraction in our levels of revenue the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of revenue for the same periods comparison was primarily the result of lower sales volume in fiscal 2002 restructuring charges we have developed and implemented restructuring plans in response to changes in business outlook with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels the frequency of our restructuring plans has been driven by the unpredictable and substantial changes in the semiconductor industry as a whole and the market for semiconductor processing equipment in particular these dynamic changes in the semiconductor industry and our business have required multiple integrated responses including those activities within our restructuring plans based on the best information and industryexpert forecasts available at that point in time although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan the extreme nature of our industry’s business cycles and the rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective the implementation of restructuring activities and recognition of their impact in our financial statements does not preclude similar but unrelated actions from being necessary in future periods we distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product facility or service 20 during fiscal 2003 we incurred 149 million of restructuring charges net associated with our fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 restructuring plans as of june 29 2003 the remaining restructuring reserve consisted of approximately 110 million related to restructurings implemented during fiscal 2003 and approximately 83 million related to restructurings implemented during fiscal 2002 fiscal 2003 restructuring activities we have developed programs and incurred restructuring charges in response to the depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry this situation has caused us to evaluate our revenue outlook and forecasts employment levels facilities utilization and outsourcing activities and the impact on manufacturing and administrative facilities based on these evaluations our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended june 29 2003 the june 2003 plan march 30 2003 the march 2003 plan and december 29 2002 the december 2002 plan prior to the end of the june 29 2003 march 30 2003 and december 29 2002 quarters management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective plans and communicated the severance packages to potentially impacted employees in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefits none of the severance payments were contingent on employee’s future service to the company the termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced the amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges are based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off as these items will have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned we applied the accounting provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” fas 146 to the fiscal 2003 restructuring activities as we earlyadopted fas 146 during the december 2002 quarter under the provisions of fas 146 the restructuring charges for the remaining contractual lease payments computed as the present value of remaining contractual payments less estimated sublease income on vacated facilities were recognized in the quarter in which the company ceased to use the facility as a result of the fiscal 2003 restructuring activities we expect quarterly savings in total expenses of approximately 10 million from the june 2003 plan 10 million from the march 2003 plan and 30 million from the december 2002 plan these estimated savings from the plans’ discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll facilities and depreciation expenses actual savings may vary from anticipated savings depending upon future events and circumstances such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts through june 29 2003 we believe actual savings are largely consistent with estimated savings however other activities and factors may significantly 21 influence our future cost structure and may offset savings from the plans june 2003 plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we reduced our workforce in north america and europe by approximately 30 people and vacated selected sales and office facilities located in north america europe and asia determined to be no longer critical to our operations the employees included in the plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the company with approximately 80 from north america and approximately 20 from our european locations we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately 76 million consisting of 08 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees 57 million of charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities a 10 million loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and 02 million for the writeoff of related leasehold improvements in june 2003 two lease agreements covering four properties were amended combined restated and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure one of the transferred leases covered one of our vacated facilities at our fremont california campus at the time of the amendment the leased facility’s fair value was less than its original cost by approximately 10 million accordingly this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the 67 million facilityrelated restructuring charge below is a table summarizing activity relating to the june 2003 plan  the remainder of the severance and benefits reserve balance of 04 million as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year the remainder of the reserve balance for lease payments on vacated facilities of 63 million as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2008 march 2003 plan during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we reduced our workforce in north america and europe by approximately 50 people and vacated selected sales and office facilities located in north america determined to be no longer critical to our operations the employees included in the plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the company with the majority of the reductions in north america we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately 47 million consisting of 16 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees 29 million of charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and 02 million for the writeoff of related leasehold improvements 22 below is a table summarizing activity relating to the march 2003 plan  the remainder of the severance and benefits reserve balance of 06 million as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year the remainder of the reserve balance for lease payments on vacated facilities of 22 million as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2007 december 2002 plan during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 we reduced our workforce in north america europe and asia by approximately 120 employees and vacated selected sales and office facilities located in north america europe and asia determined to be no longer critical to our operations the employees included in the plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the company with approximately 65 from north america and approximately 35 from

for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and 05 million for the writeoff of related leasehold improvements below is a table summarizing activity relating to the december 2002 plan  the remainder of the severance and benefits reserve balance of 01 million as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year the remainder of the reserve balance for lease payments on vacated facilities of 14 million as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of calendar year 2004 fiscal 2002 restructuring activities in response to the deterioration in semiconductor sales in the first half of fiscal 2002 which resulted in a contraction in outlook for the wafer fabrication equipment market and therefore in our revenues our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended december 30 2001 the december 2001 plan and september 23 2001 the september 2001 plan prior to the end of the december 30 2001 and september 23 2001 23 quarters management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions of the respective plans and communicated the severance packages to potentially impacted employees in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefits the termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plans of restructuring were announced lease payments on vacated facilities are based on management’s estimates using prevailing real estate market conditions we initially estimated under the plans that given prevailing real estate market conditions at that time it would take approximately 24 months to sublease our vacated facilities we revised the original estimates for lease payments on vacated facilities if prevailing real estate market conditions were different than the initial estimate leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets relating to the vacated buildings were written off as these items have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned december 2001 plan during the second fiscal quarter of 2002 we began implementing restructuring activities that included reducing our workforce by approximately 470 employees in north america europe and asia vacating selected office and warehouse facilities at our fremont california campus determined to be no longer critical to our operations and the closure of certain offices in asia the employees included in the plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the company with approximately 80 from north america and approximately 20 from asia and europe locations we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately 338 million consisting of 142 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees 96 million of charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and 99 million for the writeoff of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets during fiscal 2003 we recovered approximately 38 million of restructuring charges originally accrued under the december 2001 plan 21 million for benefits and services that were not utilized by the terminated employees and 17 million related to a revision to the net amount of lease payments remaining to be paid on the vacated facilities in addition during fiscal 2003 we recorded approximately 30 million of additional restructuring charges of which 25 million was due to revisions we made for the length of time required to sublease two of our vacated buildings in fremont california that were included in the december 2001 plan and approximately 01 million due to additional facility restoration costs incurred to fulfill our contractual obligations under the terms of a lease agreement additionally we revised our estimates related to employee termination costs and recorded 04 million of additional employee termination costs below is a table summarizing activity relating to the december 2001 plan  24 the remainder of the severance and benefits reserve balance as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year the remainder of the reserve balance for lease payments on vacated facilities of 75 million as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2008 september 2001 plan during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we began implementing restructuring activities which included a reduction of approximately 550 employees in north america europe and asia vacating selected facilities at our headquarters in fremont california determined to be no longer critical to our operations and discontinuance of the manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines the employees were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the company with approximately 85 from north america and 15 from asia and europe locations we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately 210 million consisting of 108 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees 17 million of charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities 76 million for discontinued inventory charges related to our decision to discontinue manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines and 09 million for the writeoff of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets in fiscal 2003 and 2002 we recovered approximately 17 million from unanticipated subsequent sales to our installed base of customers of certain portions of the inventory in addition in fiscal 2003 and 2002 we physically disposed of approximately 27 million of this inventory we plan to disposition the remaining quantities of this discontinued obsolete inventory by the end of the 2003 calendar year during fiscal 2002 we also recovered approximately 10 million of the september 2001 plan charge due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of 07 million and lower than estimated expenses relating to a vacated facility lease of 03 million during fiscal 2003 approximately 09 million was recovered due to 06 million of lower than previously estimated employee severance and termination costs and 03 million was recovered due to actual expenses being lower than estimated for vacated facility leases in addition during fiscal 2003 we recorded additional charges for the september 2001 plan based on a revision of our estimate of the length of time required to sublease one of our vacated buildings in fremont california based on prevailing market conditions we extended the accrual for lease payments to the end of the lease in june 2004 and recorded an additional 06 million relating to these remaining lease payments below is a table summarizing activity relating to the september 2001 plan 25  the remainder of the severance and benefits reserve balance of 02 million as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year the remainder of the reserve balance for lease payments on vacated facilities of 05 million as of june 29 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2004 fiscal 2001 restructuring activities during the quarter ended december 29 2002 we completed the restructuring activities associated with the june 2001 plan an additional 11 million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs purchased technology for research  development during the second quarter of fiscal 2001 we made an equity investment in and purchased a portfolio of cmp intellectual property rights and research and development technology from strasbaugh we recognized a onetime charge to income of 80 million for the purchase of inprocess research and development technology and recorded a 60 million investment in preferred stock and intangible assets our equity interest in strasbaugh representing approximately 20 of strasbaugh’s total capital stock is accounted for under the equity method and the intellectual property rights are being amortized ratably over five years based on our analysis of strasbaugh’s current and expected financial performance we determined in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 that the carrying value of our equity investment had experienced an otherthantemporary impairment and recorded a 20 million charge in other expense to write down the investment to its estimated fair value our equity in the income loss from strasbaugh as of the end of fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 was 08 million 08 million and 07 million respectively the income loss has not been material and therefore has been included in other income net but not presented as a separate caption on the accompanying statements of operations other income expense net other income expense net was 103 million 82 million and 151 million in fiscal year 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the change in net other expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the settlement of our equity derivative instruments indexed to lam stock and lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates partially offset by lower interest expense due to the redemption of our 5 300 million subordinated 26 debentures in september 2002 the increase in net other expense in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was driven by the nontaxable loss on our equity derivatives indexed to lam stock and smaller foreign currency exchange gains due to lower foreign currency balances on august 23 2002 we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts by purchasing approximately 35 million shares of lam common stock at an average price of 1119 per share for a total cash payment of 391 million by settling the equity derivative contracts we were able to repurchase the shares recording a life to date gain of 84 million 241 per share from their then market value resulting from this transaction we recognized an increase in treasury stock of 476 million based on the 1360 market price of our common stock at the contract settlement date august 23 2002 the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by 164 million to 84 million from their june 30 2002 fair value of 248 million this 164 million reduction in the equity derivative contracts’ fair value was recorded as a nontaxable loss in other expense in fiscal 2003 tax expense benefit our annual income tax expense benefit was 79 million 379 million and 605 million in fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the gains and losses in fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 resulting from the change in fair value of our equity derivatives indexed to our stock were nontaxable in april 2003 the internal revenue service irs closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended june 30 1998 resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to rd tax credits resulting in our recording a 249 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter in addition a tax expense of approximately 170 million associated with implementing strategies to in the longerterm limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 these tax strategies are structured to align the asset ownership and functions of our various legal entities around the world with our expectations of the level timing and sources of future revenues and profits in fiscal 2002 we recorded an income tax benefit of 379 million related to net losses incurred in addition in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we increased our tax benefit rate to 30 the increase resulted from the tax benefit of the rd credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pretax income and investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for rd tax benefits for fiscal year 2001 we recorded an income tax expense of 605 million which was 30 of income before taxes deferred tax assets we had gross deferred tax assets arising from nondeductible temporary differences net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards of 2875 million and 2904 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 the gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of 367 million and 522 million and deferred tax liabilities of 307 million and 267 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances if any outsourcing we define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these activities we have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products to market and sell what we develop and to service and 27 support directly what we sell most other activities in the company are in support of product development marketing and selling and customer service consequently in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties accordingly during fiscal 2002 we began to enter into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities management and information technology functions during fiscal 2003 we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional general and administrative functions we believe that entering into these outsourcing programs will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that occurs due to the cyclical nature of our business related party transactions during fiscal year 2001 our president and chief operating officer signed a promissory note with lam entitling him to borrow up to 10 million dollars at 675 simple interest at june 29 2003 the entire principal amount 10 million and accrued interest was outstanding the loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable in full together with accrued interest at any time but no later than may 8 2005 subsequent events during the quarter ending september 2003 we added a second condition to the accelerated vesting provision contained in one of our chairman and chief executive officer’s stock option awards that was previously modified in the december 2002 quarter when and if the vesting of the award is accelerated all unvested shares shall immediately become fully vested and exercisable and any remaining deferred compensation would then be recognized as compensation expense within sga the award now provides for accelerated vesting when each of the following conditions is met 1 the nasdaq national market closing price of lam common stock reaches or exceeds 2000 per share and 2 applying us generally accepted accounting principles lam’s fiscal quarter net income exceeds 25 million after deducting any incremental amortization expense that results from acceleration of these same options the two conditions need not be met simultaneously nor in a specific order critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluated them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ significantly from those estimates the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult complex and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant 28 judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and we have completed our system installation obligations received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the customer specifications revenue related to sales of spare parts system upgrade kits and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of performance of the services requested by a customer order revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount and a term more than one month is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 effective june 26 2000 based on guidance provided in sab 101   inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which approximate actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale when the terms of sale do not specify when title transfers we assume title transfers when we complete physical delivery of the products unless other customer practices prevail standard costs are generally reassessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts currently obtainable assembly and test labor and overhead for internally manufactured products manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes all intercompany profits related to the sale and purchase of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is writtendown to its estimated market value if less than cost inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological andor market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made   warranty typically marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we provide standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from 29 system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system customer geographic region and any known differences such as tool reliability improvements all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping actual warranty expenses are incurred on a systembysystem basis and may differ from our original estimates while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified accordingly actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred and at the same time additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems historically including the most recent 12 months ended june 29 2003 all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates in addition to the provision of standard warranties we offer customerpaid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount and a term of more than one month are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable   employee stock purchase plan and employee stock option plans we account for our employee stock purchase plan espp and stock option plans under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb 25 and interpretation no 44 “accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation — an interpretation of apb opinion no 25” fin 44 and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” fas 148 which amends statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” fas 123 our espp is a noncompensatory plan and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb 25 pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements are estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable in addition the blackscholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option because our stockbased awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in management’s opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stockbased awards to employees   deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized however ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed our current valuation allowance of 367 million covers the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options and foreign tax credits when the stock option tax benefits are realized a portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value when the foreign tax credits are realized the remaining portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed through the tax provision benefit in the statement of operations as a reduction of income tax expense 30 recent accounting pronouncements   costs associated with exit or disposal activities in july 2002 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas 146 fas 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” eitf 943 the principal difference between fas 146 and eitf 943 relates to fas 146’s requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity fas 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred under eitf 943 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan fas 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 with early adoption encouraged we earlyadopted fas 146 in the quarter ended december 29 2002 and applied its accounting provisions to the restructuring activities initiated during the quarters ended december 29 2002 march 30 2003 and june 29 2003 see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this form 10k no restructuring activities were initiated during the quarter ended september 29 2002   accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in november 2002 the fasb’s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf issue no 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” eitf 0021 eitf 0021 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables products services andor rights to use assets the provisions of eitf 0021 will be applicable for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of eitf 0021 is not currently anticipated to have a material affect on our financial position or results of operations   guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 fin 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued fin 45 also requires the guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee fin 45 also incorporates without change the guidance in fasb interpretation no 34 “disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” which is superseded by fin 45 fin 45’s disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements for periods ending after december 15 2002 the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december 31 2002 the provisions of fin 45 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this form 10k   accounting for stockbased compensation transition and disclosure in december 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensationtransition and disclosure” fas 148 which amends fas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” fas 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the “fair value” method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition fas 148 amends the disclosure requirements of fas 123 and requires prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on a company’s financial position and results of operations the transition guidance and annual 31 disclosure requirements of fas 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 we adopted the interim disclosure requirements of fas 148 for financial statements in our fiscal quarter ended march 30 2003 we intend to continue to account for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan under the provisions of apb 25 and fin 44 accordingly the adoption of fas 148 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations   consolidation of variable interest entities in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” fin 46 establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity vie sometimes formerly referred to as a special purpose entity in general a vie is a corporation partnership trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities fin 46 applies to any business enterprise both public and private that has a controlling interest contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie fin 46 provides guidance for determining when an entity the primary beneficiary should consolidate another entity a vie that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary fin 46 will require the consolidation of a vie by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the vie’s residual returns or both the effective date of the new rules under fin 46 on our existing operating leases was immediate on any new leases entered into after january 31 2003 which utilize vies or equivalent lease structures and otherwise effective the first quarter of fiscal 2004 fin 46 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations because we have transferred certain of our operating lease agreements to a new lessor that does not qualify as a vie see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this form 10k   amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities in april 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” fas 149 fas 149 amends statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” fas 133 for decisions made as part of the derivatives implementation group dig and changes financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly specifically fas 149 1 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in fas 133 2 clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that requires reporting as cash flows from financing activities in the statement of cash flows and 3 amends the definition of an “underlyingto include a variable such as the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event to correspond to the language in fin 45 these changes will result in more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that require separate accounting fas 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 however the provisions of fas 149 that codify the previous decisions made by the dig are already effective and should continue to be applied in accordance with their prior respective effective dates the adoption of fas 149 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations   accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and 32 equity” fas 150 fas 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas 150 represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that frequently are used in connection with share repurchase programs fas 150 generally requires liability classification for two broad classes of financial instruments 1 instruments that represent or indexed to an obligation to buy back the issuer’s shares regardless of whether the instrument is settled on a netcash or gross physical basis 2 obligations that can be settled in shares but meet one of the following conditions a derive their value predominately from some other underlying or b have a fixed value or have a value to the counterparty that moves in the opposite direction as the issuer’s shares many of the instruments within the scope of fas 150 were previously classified by the issuer as equity or temporary equity fas 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 the adoption of fas 150 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements consignment materials and outsourcing agreements in addition our offbalance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships for which we have an obligation under certain guarantee contracts our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table  debt and other longterm liabilities refer to “liquidity and capital resources” included in this item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for information concerning our debt and other longterm liabilities operating leases we lease most of our administrative rd and operating facilities regional salesservices offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through 2021 refer to note 17 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this form 10k for further information concerning our operating leases in march 2003 a lease agreement the agreement relating to two properties land and buildings at our fremont california campus was transferred to a new lessor and amended and restated the agreement replaces the former lease that was due to expire in march 2003 as 33 part of the agreement we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for approximately 544 million in addition we are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to 484 million at the end of the lease term in fiscal 2008 in the case that the lease is not renewed we do not exercise our purchase option and the lessor sells the property and the sale price is less than the lessor’s cost we maintain cash collateral of 544 million as of june 29 2003 in separate specified interestbearing accounts the lessor is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a vie as defined by fin 46 and therefore we do not consolidate its operations in june 2003 two lease agreements relating to four properties land and buildings at our fremont california campus were transferred to a new lessor and amended and restated the lease agreement in connection with this transaction the leases were combined and transferred from the existing lessors to a new lessor under a single lease structure as part of the lease agreement we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for approximately 580 million in addition the lease agreement requires that we guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to 503 million at the end of the lease term in fiscal 2008 in the case that the lease is not renewed we do not exercise our purchase option and the lessor sells the property and the sale price is less than the lessor’s cost additionally as part of the lease agreement we maintain cash collateral of approximately 580 million in separate specified interest bearing accounts the lessor is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a vie as defined by fin 46 and therefore we do not consolidate its operations purchase obligations during the second half of fiscal 2002 we began to enter into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities maintenance and information technology functions during fiscal 2003 we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional general and administrative functions we believe that these outsourced services will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business in addition to minimum spending commitments certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges including the potential assumption of leases assets and employees refer to note 17 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this form for additional information we have certain guaranteed purchase agreements in place that contractually obligate us to purchase a minimum amount of materials related to the manufacturing of our products at june 29 2003 our outstanding purchase obligation for these agreements was approximately 105 million consignment inventories which are owned by vendors but located in our discrete storage locations and warehouses are not reported as inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined at june 29 2003 vendor owned inventories held at lam and not reported as inventory were approximately 64 million guarantees the transferred lease agreements relating to various properties at our fremont california campus and discussed above under “operating leases” require us to guarantee residual values of the leased properties to the lessors at the end of the lease terms of up to 987 million the terms of these guarantees five years are equal to the remaining terms of the related lease agreements under the accounting provisions of fin 45 we recognized a liability of approximately 10 million for the related residual value guarantees under these leases this liability determined by computing the present value of estimated probability weighted cash flows to be paid by us over 34 the term of the guarantees was recorded as prepaid rent with the offset recorded as a liability and the amount is being amortized to rent expense for the prepaid rent and to income for the liability on a ratable basis over the fiveyear period of the leases refer to note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this form 10k for further information concerning our guaranteed residual values we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under certain of our operating lease agreements such as indemnification for certain environmental matters we have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications as of june 29 2003 we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees we have agreements with two financial institutions where our us operating company guarantees payment of our japanese subsidiary’s overdraft protection obligation the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these agreements at june 29 2003 is approximately 52 million the amount available under the overdraft protection agreement as of june 29 2003 our japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under this agreement we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these guarantees as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees we have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain us dollardenominated receivables generated from the sale of our systems subject to recourse provisions we insure these sold receivables for approximately 90 of their value and guarantee payment of the remaining uninsured receivable value in the event that the payment obligation is not satisfied based on historical payment patterns we have experienced negligible default on payment obligations and therefore believe the risk of loss from default is minimal the terms of these guarantees are from 90 days past the due date of the receivable until collected at june 29 2003 the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this agreement is approximately 28 million as of june 29 2003 we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these guarantees as we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees generally we indemnify our customers under predetermined conditions and limitations for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights by our products or services we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales prices of the products or services we do not believe based on information available that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this form 10k for discussion relating to our product warranty reserves liquidity and capital resources as of june 29 2003 we had 6259 million in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash compared with 9452 million at june 30 2002 net cash provided by operating activities was 692 million in fiscal 2003 which consists of a net loss for the year of 77 million adjusted for noncash charges of 703 million and sources of working capital of 66 million noncash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization restructuring charges deferred income taxes and the adjustment for the loss on equity derivative contracts in our stock 35 significant changes in current assets and liabilities include a 237 million improvement in accounts receivable resulting from continued improvement in accounts receivable turnover additionally our outsourcing strategy and asset management efforts contributed to reduction of inventory levels of approximately 635 million trade payables declined by 243 million due to reduced spending resulting from our cost containment activities and lower inventory purchases accrued liabilities declined by 349 million due in part to tax payments and lower interest payable resulting from the redemption of our 5 convertible subordinated notes deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue fell 184 million due to lower rates of shipments and the reduced cycle time in customer acceptances net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2003 was 2964 million we sold 3555 million net of shortterm investments that were primarily used to repay our 5 convertible subordinated notes 5 notes in september 2002 net capital expenditures were 123 million and our restricted cash increased 475 million primarily due to increased cash collateralization requirements under certain of our operating lease agreements net property and equipment was 488 million at june 29 2003 compared to 675 million at june 30 2002 the decrease in property and equipment in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily due to minimized expenditures for capital projects during fiscal 2003 and writeoffs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2003 was 3733 million and consisted primarily of the repayment of our 5 notes in the amount of 3098 million and repayment of our japanese subsidiary’s longterm loan for approximately 511 million in connection with the settlement of our equity derivative contract we repurchased approximately 35 million shares of our common stock for 391 million we also reissued 125 million from treasury stock through our employee stock purchase program net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises totaled 147 million during fiscal 2003 we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts that were recorded in other shortterm assets based on the market price of our common stock at the contract settlement date august 23 2002 the fair value of the equity derivative contracts decreased by 164 million to 84 million from their june 30 2002 fair value of 248 million currently outstanding debt obligations primarily consist of our 4 notes details of the 4 notes are  36  during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement the swap with a notional amount of 300 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our 4 notes attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate the transaction swapped 4 fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the london interbank offered rate libor resulting in interest expense savings of approximately 107 million for the fiscal year ended june 29 2003 should 6month libor interest rates rise above approximately 5 per annum in future periods we would incur incremental interest expense under the terms of the transaction we must provide collateral to match any unfavorable marktomarket exposure fair value on the swap the amount of collateral required totals a minimum of 60 million plus an amount equal to the unfavorable marktomarket exposure fair value on the swap therefore the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future will fluctuate from quarter to quarter commensurate with the marktomarket exposure fair value on the swap instrument generally the required collateral will rise as interest rates rise at the end of fiscal 2003 we have posted 60 million of collateral under this swap agreement which is included in restricted cash on our balance sheet classified as a longterm asset we have designated this swap as a fair value hedge under the provisions of fas 133 this discussion should be read in conjunction with note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10 k during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we signed a final settlement agreement with varian semiconductor equipment associates inc varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october 1993 under the terms of the settlement agreement varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation we agreed to pay varian 200 million in cash 50 million in december 2001 and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of 125 million over a threeyear period these payments began in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 as of june 29 2003 a total amount of 125 million had been paid to varian which included the initial 50 million in december 2001 and six additional quarterly installment payments of 125 million each totaling 75 million as of june 29 2003 the total obligation remaining as of june 29 2003 is 75 million which will be paid through december 2004 given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to ensure our ability to sustain levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles based upon our current business outlook our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 29 2003 combined with cash conservation activities are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months in the longer term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products 37 risk factors our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations our operating results may be adversely affected because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue andor the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to  38 further because a significant amount of our rd and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont california facility natural physical logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this facility including labor disruptions earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of highpriced systems system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue our systems can range in price from approximately 400000 to 4 million per unit and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems as a result the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns during calendar year 2001 and the first half of calendar year 2002 semiconductor manufacturers canceled or delayed delivery of orders as a result of overcapacity the resulting demand contraction had a negative impact on the level of system shipments during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 the semiconductor industry is experiencing a continued and prolonged downturn and as of the end of fiscal 2003 our customers continue to remain cautious about their levels of capital expenditures fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our financial results we depend on new products and processes for our success consequently we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and have new products manufactured successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace our 39 failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results in order to develop new products and processes we expect to continue to make significant investments in rd and to pursue joint development relationships with customers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of our primary products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by  we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue as a result the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict or prepare for similarly significant portions of our credit risk may at any given time be concentrated among a limited number of customers we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we have established longterm contracts with many of these suppliers these longterm contracts can take a variety of forms we may renew these contracts periodically in some cases these component suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative source suppliers however several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 40 we are expanding the roles that outsource providers play in our business we anticipate that these outsource providers will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in addition the expanded role of outsource providers has and will require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships andor have a negative effect on our operating results once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor’s equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment we are subject to risks associated with our competitors’ introduction of new products and we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our existing products we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process rd certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide in addition our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently or expect to offer they may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows 41 our future success depends on international sales nonus sales accounted for approximately 72 of our total revenue in fiscal 2003 71 in fiscal 2002 and 70 in fiscal 2001 we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years international sales are subject to risks including but not limited to  we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yendenominated assets and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities if we are unable to adjust the scale of our business in response to rapid changes in demand in the semiconductor equipment industry our operating results and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending on operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures on a timely basis and training managing and appropriately sizing our work force our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively if we do not adequately meet these challenges our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities as a result we may make acquisitions of 42 complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies which no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows in addition any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock the market for our common stock is extremely volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions the market price for our common stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors including but not limited to the following  in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations historically we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of stock many companies became the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert a management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the 43 price for our common stock we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business these information systems include telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet various computer hardware and software applications network communications and email these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties these information systems are subject to attacks failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses destructive or inadequate code power failures and physical damage to computers hard drives communication lines and networking equipment we have security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes that are believed to be adequate to cover the outlined risks however our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business risk associated with our interest rate swap agreement we aim to limit the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our interest rate sensitive investments and debt obligations to minimize the effect of the interest rate exposure associated with our 4 convertible subordinated notes we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 300 million we entered into the swap in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our 4 notes attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate by swapping 4 fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the libor based interest rate if 6month libor based interest rates remain at current levels or decrease we expect the swap will result in interest savings however a rise in 6month libor based interest rates above approximately 5 per annum in future periods would result in incremental levels of interest expense the potential antitakeover effects of our bylaws provisions and the rights plan we have in place may affect our stock price and inhibit a change of control desired by some of our stockholders in 1997 we adopted a rights plan the rights plan in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our common stock held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on january 31 1997 and thereafter in connection with the adoption of the rights plan our board of directors also adopted a number of amendments to our bylaws including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals our rights plan may have certain antitakeover effects our rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire lam in certain circumstances accordingly the existence of the rights plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers the rights plan however is not intended to prevent a takeover rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our board of directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation authorizes issuance of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock our board of directors without further stockholder approval may issue this preferred stock on such terms as the board of directors may determine which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of lam the issuance of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock including causing the loss of voting control moreover section 203 of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with “interested stockholders” as defined by that statute intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement unfair competition or other claims against us from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition our bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers directors and key employees provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other 44 parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights which would affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise continuing our development of new systems increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers however we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue pending applications in addition the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages 

 


 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and longterm debt obligations we maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk the table below presents principal amounts and related weightedaverage interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio longterm assets and longterm debt obligations at june 29 2003 and june 30 2002 45 

 we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification we have no foreign exchange cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate 3000 million convertible subordinated notes we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates for this reason we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our japanese yendenominated assets the changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income and expense in addition we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts we defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income on june 29 2003 the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was 22 million the unrealized loss on the contracts on june 29 2003 was 01 million a 15 appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of 04 million while depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately 15 would result in an unrealized gain of 03 million on june 29 2003 the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was 164 million the unrealized gain on the contracts on june 29 2003 was 03 million a 15 appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of 29 million depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of 46 approximately 15 would result in an unrealized gain of 21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 3000 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the company’s 4 notes attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate by swapping 4 fixed interest payments for variable interest rates payments based on libor at june 29 2003 the fair value of the swap 192 million was recorded in other longterm assets an increase in rates by 1 would result in a decline in the fair value of the swap of 77 million a decrease in rates by 1 would result in an increase in the fair value of the swap of 90 million

lam research corporation lam a delaware corporation was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in fremont california the mailing address for our principal executive offices is 4650 cushing parkway fremont california 94538 and our telephone number is 510 5720200 additional information about lam is available on our website at httpwwwlamrccom our form 10k is available online at the securities and exchange commissions website at httpwwwsecgov

we design manufacture market and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits we are recognized as a leading supplier of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits etch and chemical mechanical planarization cmp products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer to create an integrated circuit 

etch processes which are repeated numerous times during the fabrication cycle are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today our etch systems employ lams tcp Ò high density and dual frequency confined tm dfc tm  medium density plasma sources to etch device features as small as 100 nanometers nm or smaller in size

cmp is used to planarize the surface of the wafer to prepare it for further processing cmp is currently the planarization technology of choice for manufacturing integrated circuits with features 130nm and smaller with multiple metal layers our teres â cmp integrated systems provide fully integrated polishing and cleaning solutions

etch process

the etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic features on integrated circuits plasma etching was developed to meet the demand for device geometries smaller than three microns plasma consists of ions and neutral species that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric metal or polysilicon material and produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit

current generation advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems that create features of 013 micron 130nm and for future semiconductor products below 100nm the trend toward feature sizes in the 100nm range accompanies a transition from aluminum to copper conductive lines for faster device processing speeds subsequent feature size reductions below 100nm will begin to integrate more fragile dielectric materials low k and porous low k in addition to continually shrinking feature sizes advanced manufacturing facilities are now producing integrated circuits on 200mm 8inch silicon wafers and transitioning to wafer diameters of 300mm 12 inch to accommodate these decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters semiconductor manufacturers will increasingly require more precise control over the etch process

several of our etch products are available as standalone systems or as clusters used on the alliance â or 2300 tm etch multichamber platforms

dielectric etch products 

4520 series systems the 4520 system processes wafer sizes up to 200 mm and linewidths as small as 180nm 

4520xle tm system  the 4520xle ä system introduced lams proprietary dual frequency confined dfc plasma technology which reduces plasma volume and sidewall polymer accumulation for cleaner lowcost operation additionally it offers a wider process window than the 4520 system with capabilities below 180nm geometries

exelan â  exelan â high performance exelan â hpt and 2300 exelan â systems the exelan family of products extends dfc technology to create smaller feature sizes as well as to mix sequential etch processes in the same chamber which improves productivity and lowers cost of ownership exelan was introduced in july 1999 to define the structures required for manufacturing copper conductive lines in semiconductors exelan high performance introduced in 2001 extends exelans capabilities for etching newer low k insulating films exelan hpt introduced early in 2002 targets sub130nm geometries

the 2300 exelan â system addresses sub90nm requirements for 200mm and 300mm wafer sizes  process chambers are upgradable from 200mm to 300mm this capability combined with an overall system footprint comparable to 200mm systems has allowed semiconductor manufacturers to develop processes using 200mm wafers instead of more expensive 300mm wafers which can later be scaled up

conductor etch products

tcp Ò 9400 and tcp Ò 9600 series and 2300 versys tm systems  the first tcp products were introduced in late 1992 they utilize lams patented transformer coupled plasma ä source technology a highdensity lowpressure plasma source that can etch features well below 100nm for 200mm wafer sizes we offer the tcp Ò 9400se ii tcp Ò 9400ptx and tcp Ò 9400dfm addressing silicon etch applications and the tcp Ò 9600se ii tcp Ò 9600ptx and tcp Ò 9600dfm for metal etch applications these systems are used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices with feature sizes below 130nm

the 2300 versys system for silicon and metal films scale tcp technology to address leadingedge device structure requirements the 2300 versys systems have the capability to process 200 or 300mm wafer sizes the newly introduced 2300 versys star tm silicon etch system in production at several customer sites enables sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature this capability is targeted at sub90nm nextgeneration critical dimension uniformity requirements

cmp and postcmp wafer cleaning processes

cmp is a relatively new process step that was adopted by the semiconductor industry a few years ago with increasingly smaller geometries more layers are required to connect the individual devices of an integrated circuit each additional layer exaggerates the uneven topography of the previous ones creating a depth of focus problem for subsequent photolithographic steps which diminishes the precision of the linewidth dimensions the cmp process removes excess material from the wafer surface by a combination of chemical and abrasive actions to provide a flatter surface improving photolithography results additionally cmp processes are required for the creation of copper conductive lines removing the residue of the abrasive and chemical materials used in cmp requires special cleaning techniques following processing

cmp and postcmp clean products

teres ®  we offer 200mm teres cmp systems integrated with our synergy integra tm cleaning systems and 300mm systems integrated with a proprietary vertical brush cleaner these tools target advanced copperlow k and shallow trench isolation sti applications both systems incorporate our linear planarization technology tm lpt tm  which uses a highspeed belt combined with patented airbearing platen capability these features achieve uniformity control across the wafer surface by changing the shape of the belt pad using air pressure independent zones can be adjusted to change the pad pressure instead of bending the wafer backside so that fragile 300mm wafers and multilayer low k film stacks are not unnecessarily stressed during processing 

dss200 ®  the dss200 series of cleaning systems simultaneously scrub both sides of the wafer with top and bottom side brushes

synergy tm  synergy products combine dss technology and chemical mechanical cleaning tm cmc tm  technology to perform mechanical and chemical cleaning in a singlestep process the synergy integra incorporates synergys cleaning technology with a platform that can be integrated with other suppliers polishing systems certain integrated systems in the industry are the result of partnerships between lam and other polishing vendors

research and development

the market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation our ability to maintain competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to rd programs and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers and be responsive to their wafer processing needs 

our rd expenses during fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 were 1792 million 2272 million and 1769 million respectively and represented 190 150 and 144 of total revenue respectively expenditures are targeted at continued development of advanced etch cmp and postcmp clean applications and enhancements to our existing products including developing the technology necessary to support our customers transition to smaller feature sizes 90nm 65nm new materials copperbased devices and 300mm wafers 

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in rd to meet our customers product needs and enhance our competitive position 

marketing sales and service

our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers these efforts are supported by a team of product marketing professionals sales personnel as well as equipment and process engineers that work closely with individual customers to develop solutions to their processing needs aftersales support is an essential element of our marketing and sales programs we maintain ongoing support relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of field service personnel in place throughout the united states europe japan and asia pacific we believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining our competitiveness in the marketplace

we have approximately 40 sales and support centers around the world through which technical personnel sell andor service our products we provide our customers comprehensive warranty packages on all released products 

export sales

export sales accounted for approximately 44 50 and 52 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively export sales consist of sales from any of our us operating subsidiaries to nonaffiliated customers outside the us as a result a significant portion of our sales and operations will be subject to certain risks including tariffs and other barriers difficulties in staffing and managing nonus subsidiary and branch operations potentially adverse tax consequences exchange rate fluctuations and the potential for difficulty in accounts receivable collection there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and cash flows refer to note q of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein for further information concerning export sales

customers

our customers include many of the worlds leading semiconductor manufacturers no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in fiscal 2002 in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 revenue from stmicroelectronics accounted for approximately 15 of total revenue 

a material reduction in orders from several of our larger customers due to market or business conditions in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial conditions our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits in fiscal 2000 and the first half of fiscal 2001 we experienced strong demand for our systems driven by semiconductor manufacturers needs for additional capacity and new technology beginning in the second half of fiscal 2001 a slowing us economy and worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and a severe contraction of the manufacturing equipment market our customers reduced their level of capital expenditures which caused a steep decline in demand for our products in fiscal 2002 a modest recovery in our served market during the last half of fiscal 2002 supports our current outlook for slightly higher revenues in the first fiscal quarter of 2003 compared to the prior quarter 

backlog

company backlog includes orders for systems spares and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect customer delivery date changes as well as order cancellations we schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers delivery requirements included in our systems backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted prices agreed and shipment dates assigned the spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided where specific customer service and spares contracts do not contain specific delivery dates we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period not exceeding 12 months in calculating backlog amounts

as of june 30 2002 and june 24 2001 our backlog was approximately 287 million and 231 million respectively all orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers generally with limited penalties because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and because of possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues for succeeding periods

manufacturing

our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are then integrated into finished systems most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments prior to shipping a completed system customer representatives may perform acceptance tests at our facility after passing these acceptance tests the system is vacuumbagged in a cleanroom environment and prepared for shipment 

during fiscal 2002 we entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing production warehousing and logistics functions we believe that entering into these outsourcing contracts will provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up and down in a more timely and cost effective manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business we believe that we have selected reputable providers and are securing their performance on terms documented in written contracts however it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in addition the expanded role of outsource providers has required us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to effectively manage the performance of those outsource providers we believe that we have implemented adequate supervision procedures even so any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and have a negative effect on our operating results refer to note u of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments

certain of the components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we believe that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have an adverse shortterm effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships

environmental matters

we are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation fines lawsuits or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our business we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities

employees

as of september 3 2002 we had approximately 2500 regular fulltime employees 

each of our employees signs an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information and most of our employees have stock or stock option arrangements with us that provide for the vesting of their options over several years 

in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries competition for highly skilled employees is intense our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in rd and customer support functions 

competition

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive throughout the world our management believes that to compete effectively we must invest significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to develop enhanced product capabilities certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support organizations we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price performance characteristics if our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering etch cmp or postcmp clean products similar to those we sell our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected in addition semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate processing equipment into a semiconductor production line as a result once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular suppliers tool set the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application accordingly we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitors system there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to compete successfully on a worldwide basis 

we face significant competitive factors in the equipment market including quality repeatability process capability and flexibility and overall cost of ownership which may be affected by factors such as reliability software automation throughput customer support and system price although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to many of these factors our ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future our primary competitors in the etch market are applied materials inc and tokyo electron limited our teres cmp integrated polishing system faces significant competition from applied materials inc ebara corp and speedfamipec inc in cmp slurry removal and cleaning applications our competitors include dainippon screen manufacturing co ltd and verteq inc

patents and licenses

our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research engineering manufacturing and support activities we hold united states patents and nonus patents covering various aspects of our products and processes we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein our patents which cover material aspects of our past and present core products have current durations ranging from approximately seven to seventeen years we believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value they will not alone determine our success which depends principally upon our engineering marketing service and manufacturing skills however in the absence of patent protection we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products manufacturing techniques and processes in addition other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes the sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 

from time to time we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties patent or other intellectual property rights by our products in such cases it is our policy to defend the claims or if considered appropriate negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms however no assurance can be given that we will be able in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for further discussion of legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k

the information required by this item is incorporated by reference from item 6 selected financial data below




 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

results of operations

lam research corporation is a leading supplier of technically complex thin film selective removal equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits our product offerings include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications cmp and postcmp wafer cleaning systems and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers 

the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns over the past three business cycles the severity of the semiconductor business cycle has increased demand for our equipment can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including but not limited to economic conditions supply and demand for semiconductors customer capacity requirements and our ability to develop and market competitive new products for these and other reasons our results of operations for fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 

total revenue

our total revenues were 9431 million 15198 million and 12308 million for fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively total revenue of 15198 million in fiscal 2001 reflected the adoption of sab 101 as of the beginning of that year the decrease in revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is due to a worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits which resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and a severe contraction in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market during the third quarter of fiscal 2001 we began to see signs of a downturn excess inventory of telecommunication products diminished personal computer sales and a slowing economy caused semiconductor companies to sharply reduce capital expenditures and delay or cancel equipment orders these order reductions had a negative impact on the level of our systems shipments starting in the june 2001 quarter revenues decreased across nearly all product lines in fiscal 2002 while the overall industry slowed our customers continued to make selective purchases to support development of processes needed for smaller device feature sizes and for copper and new materials integration as well as the transition to 300mm size wafers 

revenue in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 reflected a period of expansion in our served markets driven by semiconductor manufacturers needs for increased capacity in addition our customers were transitioning to smaller geometries and new materials such as copper proportionally more of our revenue growth can be attributed to our etch family of products

we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 effective june 26 2000 based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements refer to our discussion of critical accounting policies for additional information about our revenue recognition policy

based on the guidance provided by sab 101 we generally recognize new systems revenue upon customer acceptance as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation systems revenue recognition generally occurs from two to seven months after the date of shipment

regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows 

 

year ended  june 30 june 24 june 25 2002 2001 2000    north america 29 30 29 europe 21 28 28 asia pacific 35 33 31 japan 15 9 12 a modest recovery in demand for wafer fabrication equipment during the last half of fiscal 2002 supports our current outlook for slightly higher revenues in the first fiscal quarter 2003 compared to the prior quarter as current manufacturing activity by our customers has improved 

gross margin

gross margin was 2661 million 6535 million and 5419 million in fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively as a percentage of total revenue gross margins were 282 430 and 440 in fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 stems from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower production volumes additionally inventory writedowns of approximately 241 million and a patent litigation settlement charge of 388 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2002 and inventory related net restructuring charges after recoveries of 59 million unfavorably impacted gross margins in fiscal 2002 the decrease in our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 resulted primarily from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs in the second half of fiscal 2001 due to the industry slowdown

during the last quarter of fiscal 2002 we experienced a favorable gross margin progression due to better capacity utilization of both our factory and field service resources and from the impact of cost reduction programs excluding restructuring reserve recovery gross margin for the june 2002 quarter was 359 of total revenue compared to 335 of total revenue in the march 2002 quarter our current outlook is for gross margin as a percent of revenue to rise sequentially in the first fiscal quarter 2003 due to higher revenues and increased production efficiencies 

research and development

rd expenses were 1792 million 2272 million and 1769 million in fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively as a percentage of total revenue rd expenses were 190 150 and 144 for fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in rd expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is primarily the result of lower sales volume the decrease in rd expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 results from controlled spending on general rd programs consistent with the downturn in the business cycle 

the increase in rd expenses in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by expanded levels of investment in advanced etch and cmpclean applications including developing the technology necessary to support smaller geometries new insulating materials copperbased devices and 300 mm size wafers 

we believe that in order to remain competitive we must continue to invest substantially in rd accordingly we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to these programs we expect to continue making sizeable investments in advanced etch and cmpclean applications and in enhancing our existing products during fiscal 2003

selling general and administrative

selling general and administrative sga expenses excluding restructuring chargesrecoveries were 1619 million 2189 million and 1613 million in fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively as a percentage of total revenue sga expenses excluding restructuring chargesrecoveries were 172 144 and 131 in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is largely due to manpower reductions lower incentive payments to employees shutdown days and other cost reduction programs the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2002 is primarily the result of lower sales volume the increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by infrastructure expansion needed to sustain higher sales marketing and administrative support for our expanding business in the first half of fiscal 2001 sga increased as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2001 largely due to the decline in sequential quarterly revenue starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001

restructuring charges

we have developed restructuring plans in response to changes in business outlook with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels expenses have been incurred associated with cost containment activities including downsizing and reorganizations and business exit activities related to discontinued product lines accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan the nature of our extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective the recognition of a restructuring event does not necessarily exclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods

in april 2001 we announced plans to reduce our global workforce up to 15 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 the june 2001 plan the reduction in force was driven by the then anticipated level of decline in our revenues due to the forecasted contraction of our served market from calendar year 2000 levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 the june 2001 plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan we began implementing the announced restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by approximately 11 prior to june 24 2001 we recorded a restructuring charge of 168 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees charges for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities and charges for inventories of an etch product line that has been discontinued in addition we consolidated our fremont manufacturing facilities and wroteoff the carrying cost of abandoned facility assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we determined that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered 14 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we also recovered 09 million from certain of our etch product line inventory previously segregated and writtenoff

below is a table summarizing activity relating to the june 2001 plan

lease payments on vacated facilities relates to the remainder of the lease term after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under longterm operating lease agreements we estimated given the prevailing real estate market conditions that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease our vacated buildings in fremont california when applicable anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for the remaining lease payments

we wroteoff all leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately 15 million as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned in addition certain demonstration equipment and etch product line inventory were abandoned and writtenoff 

other exit costs relate to customer accommodations for the discontinued product line and expenses associated with capital improvements to the vacated facilities 

our business outlook in mid to late summer of 2001 indicated further deterioration in semiconductor sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 resulting in a lower outlook for the wafer fabrication equipment market and therefore in our revenues consequently in august 2001 we announced a new plan the september 2001 plan to further reduce our fixed cost infrastructure including an approximate 10 reductioninforce during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 the september 2001 plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan we began implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduced our workforce by approximately 550 employees worldwide prior to september 23 2001 we recorded a restructuring charge of 210 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees writeoffs for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities and charges for inventories of selected older etch product lines that were discontinued during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we determined that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered 07 million of restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we also recovered 08 million from certain of our older etch inventories previously segregated and writtenoff and 03 million from facilities leases

lease payments on vacated facilities relates to 24 months of rent or the remainder of the lease term if less after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under longterm operating lease agreements we estimated given prevailing real estate market conditions that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease the vacated facilities in fremont california 

we wroteoff leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately 09 million as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned additionally we exited selected older etch product lines and wroteoff the related discontinued manufacturing inventory

the continued and severe degradation in the wafer fabrication equipment market in late calendar year 2001 and its impact on our nearterm financial forecast necessitated another restructuring plan the december 2001 plan in december 2001 we publicly announced our intention to reduce global employment by approximately 12 and further consolidate our facilities during the second fiscal quarter the december 2001 plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan we began implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduction of our workforce by approximately 470 employees worldwide prior to december 30 2001 we recorded a restructuring charge of 338 million relating to severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the writeoff of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets

below is a table summarizing activity relating to the december 2001 plan

lease payments on vacated facilities relates to 24 months of rent or the remainder of the lease term if less after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under longterm operating lease agreements we estimated given prevailing real estate market conditions that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease the vacated facilities in fremont california 

we wrote off leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately 88 million as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned additionally certain fixed assets of approximately 11 million associated with these facilities had no future economic benefit and have been abandoned and writtenoff

as summarized above restructuring activities have had a significant impact on our operating results as discussed under recent accounting pronouncements below the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 146  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  fas 146 had fas 146 been applicable when we undertook our restructuring activities the timing and amount of the charges recognized may have been different than those reported fas 146 is applicable to restructuring activities initiated on or after december 31 2002 with early adoption encouraged fas 146 does not apply to our previous restructuring activities 

asset impairment charges

during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we determined that the carrying value of certain laboratory and demonstration equipment to be disposed of exceeded its fair value less cost to sell fair value was assessed using the market values of similar used laboratory and demonstration equipment impairment occurred due to rapid technological changes brought about by the semiconductor industrys move to copper and 300mm applications in accordance with fas 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 95 million a 53 million writedown to fair value of certain laboratory tools is included in rd expenses and 42 million of writedowns to fair value of demonstration equipment are included in sga expenses remaining equipment with carrying values totaling 11 million is reviewed quarterly for incremental impairment and is anticipated to be disposed of within the next 12 months 

patent litigation settlement

on december 19 2001 we signed a final settlement agreement with varian semiconductor equipment associates inc in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october 1993 under the terms of the settlement agreement varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation we agreed to pay varian 200 million in cash 50 million in december 2001 and the balance of 150 million to be paid quarterly over the next 3 years and issued a warrant with a fair value of 215 million that entitled varian to purchase 2000000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 2130 per share as part of the full and final settlement varian and lam agreed to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims relating to the litigation

in connection with the settlement we recorded a charge of 388 million in the quarter ended december 30 2001 which represents approximately 93 of the total value of the settlement the remaining portion of the total value of the settlement relating to the future licensed use of the patents 27 million is being amortized ratably over 10 quarters

the imputed value of the warrant was determined using the blackscholes valuation model the key assumptions used in the valuation model were an expected life of 4 years anticipated stock price volatility of 61 and a riskfree interest rate of 45

purchased technology for research  development

during the second quarter of fiscal 2001 we made an equity investment in and purchased a portfolio of cmp intellectual property rights and research and development technology from strasbaugh we recognized a onetime charge to income of 80 million for the purchase of inprocess research and development technology and recorded a 60 million investment in preferred stock and intangible assets our equity interest in strasbaugh representing approximately 20 of strasbaughs total capital stock is accounted for under the equity method and the intellectual property rights are being amortized ratably over five years 

based on our analysis of strasbaughs current and expected financial performance we determined in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 that the carrying value of our equity investment had experienced an otherthantemporary impairment and recorded a 20 million charge in other expense to write down the investment to its estimated fair value

our equity in the income loss from strasbaugh as of the end of fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was 08 million and 07 million respectively the income loss has not been material and therefore has not been itemized in other income net on the accompanying statements of operations 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2000 we purchased intellectual property rights related to the semiconductor equipment industry from oliver design inc oliver we recognized an expense for the purchase of research and development technology of approximately 75 million and capitalized 15 million related to acquired patents which are being amortized ratably over their estimated useful life of five years the technology is being used in a next generation product development project and has no future alternative use

other income expense net

other income expense net was 82 million 151 million and 70 million in fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in net other expense in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was driven by lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates in fiscal 2002 the nontaxable loss on our equity derivatives indexed to lam stock and the decrease in foreign currency exchange gains due to lower foreign currency balances the increase in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by higher interest income on a substantially larger average investment portfolio

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we applied emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0019 in accounting for our equity derivatives indexed to our own stock in accordance with eitf 0019 we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of certain put and call options indexed to our own stock as an asset the cumulative change was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement if any will be nontaxable we adjust the carrying value of these derivative instruments to their fair value at the end of each reporting period with the change in fair value being recorded as a gain or lose in our statement of operations for additional information about our accounting for these equity derivatives refer to our discussion of investments in derivative financial instruments indexed to lam research corporation stock included in critical accounting polices in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

based on a june 28 2002 stock price of 1798 the fair value of the equity derivatives was 248 million which resulted in a nontaxable loss of 82 million for fiscal 2002

tax expense benefit 

our effective annual income tax rate was 317 excluding the loss on equity derivative contracts indexed to our stock in fiscal year 2002 and 300 and 135 in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 respectively the cumulative loss from the change in fair value of our equity derivatives indexed to our stock is nontaxable the fiscal year 2000 rate reflected the benefit of net operating losses and research and development tax credits carried over from prior periods during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 income tax benefit was recorded using a 100 tax rate estimate income tax benefit in subsequent fiscal 2002 quarters was recorded using a 300 tax benefit rate estimate the increase in the tax benefit rate results from the tax benefit of the rd credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pretax income and our continued and substantial investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for rd tax benefits

deferred tax assets

we had gross deferred tax assets arising from nondeductible temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards of 2904 million 2441 million and 2025 million in fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of 522 million 312 million and 947 million and deferred tax liabilities of 267 million 356 million and 190 million in fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively realization of the majority of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income and we believe that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized based on forecasted profitability however there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future income we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for additional valuation allowances if any 

outsourcing 

we define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these capabilities we have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products to market and sell what we develop and to service and support directly with our customers what we sell most other activities in the company are in support of product development marketing and selling and customer service consequently over the last 15 months we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties accordingly during fiscal 2002 we entered into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing warehousing facilities management and information technology functions we believe that entering into these outsourcing programs may provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up and down in a more timely and cost effective manner to respond to requirements generated by the cyclical nature of our business implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that occurs due to the cyclical nature of our business 

related party transactions

during fiscal year 2001 our president and chief operating officer signed a promissory note with lam entitling him to borrow up to 10 million dollars at 675 simple interest at june 30 2002 the entire principal amount 10 million and accrued interest was outstanding the loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable in full together with accrued interest at any time but no later than may 8 2005 

subsequent events 

the 5 convertible subordinated notes 5 notes matured on september 2 2002 and were repaid in full this resulted in a cash outlay of approximately 3098 million

at the end of august 2002 we repurchased approximately 35 million shares of our common stock with a market value of 476 million 1360 per share by physically settling certain put and call option contracts equity derivative contracts which gave us the right to repurchase the shares for 391 million 1119 per share from independent third parties by settling the equity derivative contracts we were able to repurchase the shares at a discount of 84 million 241 per share from their fair market value as a result of this transaction we recognized an increase in treasury stock of 476 million from june 30 2002 through the settlement date the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by 164 million to 84 million as a result of changes in the fair value of our common stock over the same period this reduction in the equity derivative contracts fair value will be included in our earnings for the quarter ending september 29 2002

critical accounting policies and estimates

use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and we have completed our system installation obligations and received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations in the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision we will recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the customer specifications revenue related to spare parts sales system upgrade kits and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract 

we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 effective june 26 2000 based on guidance provided in securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements prior to fiscal year 2001 the companys revenue recognition policy was generally to recognize revenue for sales of equipment at the time of shipment

as a result of our change in revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and the cumulative effect of the change on our financial statements the deferred revenue balance upon adopton of sab 101 as of june 26 2000 was 4330 million consisting of equipment that was shipped but had not yet been accepted as of june 25 2000 of this amount we recognized revenue of 291 million and 4010 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively at june 30 2002 the deferred revenue balance including 29 million attributable to the cumulative effect adjustment was approximately 1212 million 

investments in derivative financial instruments indexed to lam research corporation stock in november 2000 the fasbs emerging issues task force eitf reached final consensus on eitf issue no 0019 determination of whether share settlement is within the control of the issuer for the purposes of applying eitf issue no 9613 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock eitf 0019 eitf 9613 addresses accounting for equity derivative contracts indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock equity derivatives by providing guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity temporary equity and assets and liabilities under eitf 0019 equity derivatives that were issued prior to september 20 2000 and classified as permanent equity must meet certain criteria or be reclassified as assets or liabilities to qualify as permanent equity all the following criteria must be met the equity derivative contract must permit the company to settle in unregistered shares the company must have sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract the contract must contain an explicit limit on the number of shares to be delivered in a share settlement there can be no requirement in the contract to post collateral there can be no make whole provisions in the contract that require cash settlement and there can be no provisions in the contract that indicate the counterparty has rights that rank higher than those of a common shareholder equity derivative contracts accounted for as permanent equity are recorded at their initial fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized unless a change in the contract classification occurs equity derivative contracts not qualifying for permanent equity accounting are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with subsequent changes in fair value recognized through the statement of operations 

lam equity derivatives include certain put and call options indexed to our own stock application of eitf 0019 requires these instruments be recorded at their fair value at the end of each reporting period the change in fair value being recorded as a gain or loss on our statement of operations our equity derivatives are collateralized by restricted cash of 91 million and may not be settled in unregistered shares

in accordance with eitf 0019 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of these put and call options indexed to our own stock as an asset the june 24 2001 cumulative effect adjustment a gain of 331 million 025 per diluted share was based on a june 24 2001 stock price of 2850 the cumulative change in fair value was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement will be nontaxable

based on a june 28 2002 stock price of 1798 the 248 million fair value of the equity derivatives resulted in a nontaxable loss of 82 million for the year ended june 30 2002 the loss is recorded in other income expensein the june 2002 condensed consolidated statement of operations the fair value of the options is recorded in other current assets 

see subsequent events included herein item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfor information concerning the settlement of our equity derivatives

refer to item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for additional information about our investments in equity derivative financial instruments 

inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market using standard costs which approximate actual cost we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity onhand and standard cost for each product including purchased components subassemblies and finished goods we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer generally title transfer is documented in the terms of sale when the terms of sale do not specify when title transfers we assume title transfers when we complete physical delivery of the products 

standard costs are generally reassessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts and currently achievable assembly and test labor and overhead for manufactured products manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to fully absorb spending at average utilization volumes all intercompany profits related to the sale and purchase of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements

the assembly outsourcing initiative has and will continue to alter the composition of reported cost of sales over time proportionately more costs will comprise purchased materials and less will represent manufacturing labor and overhead reflecting the substitution of our assembly activities with the purchase of completed modules and integrated units from new outsource assembly vendors

management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials workinprocess finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months based on estimated customer product orders is writtendown to its estimated market value if less than cost inherent in the estimates of market value are managements estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules customer demand technological and or market obsolescence general semiconductor market conditions possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections additional inventory writedowns may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made

installation and warranty typically part of marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes installing and providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system we generally record actual labor and material expenses for installation activities to cost of sales upon equipment acceptance and revenue recognition we also provide a contractual performance warranty on our systems the period of which runs concurrent with the system installation process generally 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition the amount recorded is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system customer and geographic region modified for any known differences such as a new simpler installation process or the impact of system reliability improvements where customer and system specific installation and warranty reserves are established all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping

actual warranty expenses incurred on a systembysystem basis and overall may differ from our original estimates while we consistently monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified accordingly actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred and at the same time additional probable and estimable liabilities recorded

we do not maintain general or unspecified provisions or reserves all warranty reserves are related to specific systems historically including the most recent 12 months ended june 30 2002 all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates

in addition to the provision of standard warranties the company provides customer paid extended warranty services revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a term of more than one month are recognized on a prorated straightline basis over the term of the contract related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable

at june 30 2002 warranty reserves were 155 million compared to 283 million at june 24 2001

employee stock purchase plan and employee stock option plans we account for our stock purchase plan and stock option plans under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and make pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method under statement of financial accounting standard no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation fas 123 were followed our employee stock purchase plan is a noncompensatory plan and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb 25

pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable in addition the blackscholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option because our stockbased awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in managements opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stockbased awards to employees

deferred income taxes  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we have considered future estimated taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed our current valuation allowance covers the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options when these tax benefits are realized the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value

recent accounting pronouncements

impairment or disposals of longlived assets  in august 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 144 fas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 144 supersedes fas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of and applies to all longlived assets including discontinued operations we are required to adopt fas 144 at the beginning of fiscal 2003 fas 144 is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or operating results

costs associated with exit or disposal activities in july 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 146  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  fas 146 fas 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 943 the principal difference between fas 146 and eitf 943 relates to fas 146s requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity fas 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred under eitf 943 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan fas 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 with early adoption encouraged fas 146 is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of operations 

consolidation of certain specialpurpose entities  in june 2002 the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 51 consolidated financial statements consolidation of certain specialpurpose entitiesthe proposed interpretation or exposure draft that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of specialpurpose entities spe the proposed interpretation will apply to any business enterprise both public and private that has a controlling interest contractual relationship or other business relationship with an spe the exposure draft provides guidance for determining when an entity the primary beneficiary should consolidate another entity a spe that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary the proposed interpretation may result in our having to consolidate the operating results of a spe or similar entity which is a lessor under one of our operating lease agreements the fasb expects to issue the interpretation in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2002 the effective date of these proposed new rules on our current operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our fiscal quarter ending june 2003 and sooner on any new leases entered into after the new rules effective date which utilize spes or equivalent lease structures implementation of this exposure draft when and if it becomes a final accounting rule could require us to consolidate the activities of the spe and recognize the asset and related liability

guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others in may 2002 the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation that would require a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued the proposed interpretation would also require a company the guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee the proposed interpretation does not provide guidance on the subsequent measurement of the guarantors recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee the proposed interpretaton would also incorporate without change the guidance in fasb interpretation no 34 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded implementation of this exposure draft when and if it becomes a final accounting rule would be effective for financial statements for periods ending after december 25 2002 and would be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december 31 2002 the proposed interpretation is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of operations

liquidity and capital resources

as of june 30 2002 we had 9452 million in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash compared with 9254 million at june 24 2001

subsequent event the 5 notes principal amount of 3098 million matured on september 2 2002 and were redeemed in cash the proceeds we used to redeem the 5 notes came primarily from shortterm investments that had matured subsequent to june 30 2002

net cash provided by operating activities was 218 million in fiscal 2002 net loss for the year of 901 million adjusted for noncash charges of 1385 million resulted in positive cash flow of 484 million which was partially offset by uses of working capital totaling 266 million noncash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization patent litigation settlement restructuring charges deferred income taxes impairment charges and the adjustment for the loss on equity derivative contracts in company stock

significant changes in current assets and liabilities resulted from improved accounts receivable turnover and the continued use of programs to selectively sell accounts receivables which resulted in a 1182 million improvement additionally highly controlled purchasing processes combined with lower shipments and inventory writedowns for excess obsolete and older generation products reduced inventory by approximately 965 million accrued liabilities declined by 654 million due to reduced compensation and warranty liabilities deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue fell 1874 million in line with equipment delivery trends

net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2002 was 881 million down from 4275 million in 2001 significant uses of cash in fiscal 2002 included net purchases of shortterm investments of 654 million and limited capital expenditure projects of 106 million additionally restricted cash increased 105 million mostly due to collateral requirements of our interest rate swap agreement

net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2002 was 163 million net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock generated 194 million we repurchased 107 million of common stock and reissued 163 million of treasury stock through the employee stock purchase program principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations were 87 million 

property and equipment was 675 million at june 30 2002 compared to 1265 million at june 24 2001 the decrease in property and equipment in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is primarily due to minimum expenditures for capital projects during fiscal 2002 writeoffs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities and impairments of certain laboratory and demonstration equipment 

at june 30 2002 our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to our debt retirements lease payments other longterm liabilities and outsourced functions are as follow

 

debt and other outsourcing longterm operating and consignment liabilities leases contracts    in thousands through june 29 2003 1  315291  63553  34321 2004 through 2006 359691 86909 9586 2007 and thereafter  7687    total   674982  158149  43907    1 the 5 notes principal amount of 3098 million mature on september 2 2002 and are included in the current liabilities section of the balance sheet as of june 30 2002

debt financing includes two convertible subordinated notes and a yendenominated term loan details of the convertible notes are



during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we entered into a threeyear yendenominated term loan for approximately ¥60 billion 485 million at june 30 2002 with a syndicate of financial institutions in order to fund our japanese subsidiary operations the entire principal amount under the new term loan is due at maturity june 11 2004 and has a floating interest rate based on the tokyo interbank offered rate tibor which at june 30 2002 was 26 per annum 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 300 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the companys 4 notes attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate the transaction swapped 4 fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the london interbank offered rate libor based interest rate resulting in interest expense savings of approximately 35 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 should 6month libor interest rates rise above approximately 5 per annum in future periods incremental interest expense to the company may be incurred under the terms of the transaction we must provide collateral to match any marktomarket exposure on the swap the amount of collateral required totals a minimum of 60 million plus an amount equal to the marktomarket exposure on the swap therefore the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future will fluctuate from quarter to quarter commensurate with the marktomarket exposure on the swap instrument generally the required collateral will rise as interest rates rise at the end of fiscal 2002 we have 105 million in restricted cash on our balance sheet classified as a longterm asset related to this transaction 

the swap is accounted for as a fair value hedge under the provisions of fas 133 this discussion should be read in conjunction with note e of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k

on december 19 2001 we signed a final settlement agreement with varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october 1993 under the terms of the settlement agreement varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation we agreed to pay varian 200 million in cash 50 million in december 2001 and the balance of 150 million to be paid quarterly over the next 3 years the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above includes our cash obligations at june 30 2002 related to the varian settlement

we lease most of our administrative rd and manufacturing facilities regional salesservice offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through 2021 generally all of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont california headquarters and certain operating leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods certain of our other facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation 

lease agreements relating to certain buildings at our fremont california campus require us to provide guaranteed residual values totaling 971 million at the end of the respective lease terms which are reflected in the preceding table 444 million in 2003 252 million in 2005 and 275 million in 2006 the lessor associated with one of these lease agreements is a spe or equivalent structure presently we account for this lease as an operating lease while the spe owns and accounts for the leased assets and related liabilities the fasb has issued an exposure draft consolidation of certain special purpose entites  a proposed interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 51  consolidated financial statements that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of spes implementation of this exposure draft when and if it becomes a final accounting rule could require us to consolidate the activities of the spe and recognize the asset and related liability

additionally one of our lease agreements includes collateral restrictions that require us to maintain a certain amount of cash 514 million at june 30 2002 in restricted specified interest bearing accounts these restricted cash accounts must be maintained through march 2003 unless the agreement is otherwise terminated or the amount of required cash collateral is reduced as the underlying obligation is paid down by the lessor

during the second half of fiscal 2002 we entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing warehousing logistics facilities maintenance and information technology functions these outsourced services should provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum outsourcing obligations at june 30 2002 under these arrangements actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition to minimum spending commitments these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges including the assumption of leases assets and employees

consignment inventories which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses are not reported as inventory until title is transferred or our purchase obligation is determined at june 30 2002 vendor owned inventories held at lam and not reported as inventory were approximately 15 million

in fiscal 1999 we entered into certain option transactions with independent third parties the third parties for the purchase and sale of our common stock our board of directors authorized us to acquire from the third parties options to purchase up to 105 million shares of our common stock these call options were to be acquired to offset the anticipated dilutive effect of a potential conversion into common stock of the 5 convertible subordinated notes previously issued by us and which became due september 2 2002 as part of the program the board of directors also authorized us to enter into the sale of put options with the same third parties covering up to 1575 million shares of our common stock we anticipated that the premiums we would receive over the course of the program from the sale of the put options to the third parties would offset in full the premium cost of our purchase of the call options from those same third parties 

pursuant to the authorization described above as of june 30 2002 we have acquired call options to purchase 372 million shares of our common stock the weightedaverage exercise price of these options is 1129 the call options provide that our maximum benefit at expiration is 1797 per option share the difference between 2926 which is the conversion price of the 5 notes issued in august 1997 and the weighted average exercise price of the call options we also entered into put option contracts with these same third parties covering 558 million shares of our common stock giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 948 per share  on june 1 2002 all but one of these outstanding put option contracts expired as of june 30 2002 we have one remaining put option contract with a third party covering 304 million shares of our common stock giving the third party the right to sell to us shares of our common stock at a weightedaverage price of 932 per share

the call and put options are european style options exercisable upon expiration all of the options expire no later than september 3 2002 which is the business day following the date on which the 5 notes must either be converted or retired upon option exercise we have the ability at our discretion to permit the options to be physically settled ie shares would be delivered to us against payment of the exercise price settled in cash ie by a payment from one party to the other of the value of the option being exercised or net settled in shares ie by delivery of a number of shares of common stock having a value equal to the value of the option being exercised certain scenarios may require that we deliver cash to the counterparty to achieve full settlement under the terms of the instruments we can also terminate the options prior to expiration for a settlement value determined from time to time by the appropriate third party while the options are only exercisable at expiration the terms of the contracts with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of the options upon the occurrence of certain events in a form determined by us which includes net settlement of shares including without limitation our material breach of the agreement default on certain indebtedness or covenants relating to our financial condition reduction in our sp credit rating below b or a drop in the price of our common stock to less than 167 per share 

we account for these derivative financial instruments indexed and potentially settled in our stock under the provisions of eitf 0019 at june 30 2002 the instruments had a net fair value of 248 million and are included in other current assets 

if the average stock price is below 932 during any period the required number of shares to net settle the companys obligation under the put option agreement would be considered dilutive securities in our dilutive earnings per share eps calculation 

see subsequent events included herein item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information concerning the repayment of our 5 notes that matured september 2 2002 and the settlement of our equity derivatives

given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry we believe that maintenance of sufficient liquidity reserves is important to ensure our ability to sustain levels of investment in rd and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles based upon our current business outlook our levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 30 2002 combined with cash conservation activities are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations investments capital expenditures settlement in cash of our 5 notes which matured on september 2 2002 and settlement of equity derivative contracts through at least the end of calendar year 2003 

in the longerterm liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products

 

risk factors

our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors not all of which are in our control these factors include but are not limited to

economic conditions in the semiconductor industry generally and the equipment industry specifically the extent that customers use our products and services in their business customer acceptances of equipment the size and timing of orders from customers customer cancellations or delays in our shipments installations andor acceptances our ability in a timely manner to develop introduce and market new enhanced and competitive products our competitors introduction of new products legal or technical challenges to our products and technology new or modified accounting regulations changes in average selling prices and product mix changes in importexport regulations exchange rate fluctuations and exposure on interest rate swap agreements we manage our expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenues if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations our operating results may be adversely affected we derive our revenue primarily from the shipment and acceptance of a relatively small number of highpriced systems our systems can range in price from approximately 400000 to 4 million per unit because our operating expenses are based on anticipated future revenues and a high percentage of those expenses are relatively fixed a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter 

our operating results for a quarter may suffer substantially if

we ship fewer systems than we anticipate in any quarter 

our customers delay final acceptance of our shipments 

we do not receive anticipated purchase orders in time to enable shipment or acceptance of equipment during a given quarter 

one or more customers delays or cancels anticipated shipments andor installations 

shipments are delayed by procurement shortages or manufacturing or transportation difficulties or our suppliers or outsource vendors fail to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations further because most of our manufacturing and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont california facility natural physical logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this facility including labor disruptions earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance 

variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results

in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission issued sab no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 provides guidance on the recognition of revenue for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and product installation commitments prior to sab 101 we generally recognized new systems revenue on the date the equipment was shipped to customers under sab 101 we now generally recognize revenue for new equipment on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse as a result the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments 

our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns in late fiscal 1999 increased demand for our products drove revenue growth throughout fiscal 2000 and early fiscal 2001 in the later part of the december 2000 quarter we began to see signs that this upturn was slowing and that customers were considering reductions in equipment purchases during the first half of calendar year 2001 these signs were confirmed in calendar year 2001 as semiconductor manufacturers canceled or delayed delivery of orders as a result of overcapacity the resulting demand contraction had a negative impact on the level of system shipments during fiscal 2002 

fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers and pricing volatility are expected to continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments revenues and operating results we will continue to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at alignment of our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams which sometimes result in restructuring charges even during periods of reduced revenues we must continue to invest in product research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive which may temporarily harm our financial results

we depend on new products and processes for our success for this reason we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change

rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop manufacture and successfully introduce new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products we strive to accurately forecast demand for new products while managing the transition from older products if new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace which would materially and adversely affect our results from operations

we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to pursue joint development relationships with customers or other members of the industry we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products future technologies processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete leaving us with noncompetitive products or obsolete inventory or both we may be unable in a timely manner to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance in addition in connection with the development of new products we will invest in pilot production inventory our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in inventory obsolescence which would adversely affect our financial results

we are subject to risks associated with the introduction of new products

we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products which may affect our ability to sell our products furthermore our own introduction of new products represents significant investments of our resources and their success or lack thereof could have a material effect on our financial results 

we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term continued market acceptance of our primary products is therefore critical to our future success our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by

a decline in demand for our products 

a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products 

an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in 

technological change that we are unable to address with our products and 

a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 

we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers

we obtain certain components and subassemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers generally each of our key suppliers has a oneyear blanket purchase contract under which we may issue purchase orders we may renew these contracts periodically each of these component suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative source suppliers several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to lam where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources nevertheless a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships 

our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 

we are expanding the role that outsource providers play in our business we anticipate that these outsource providers will play keys roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts it is possible that one or more of these providers will fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business in addition the expanded role of outsource providers will require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and have a negative effect on our operating results

once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitors semiconductor manufacturing equipment the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitors equipment making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer

semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular suppliers processing equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitors equipment

we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share

we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry in addition there are smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies that may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently or expect to offer

we anticipate our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced performance characteristics if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop it could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers in addition competitors with higher levels of financial resources than we have may deeply discount or give away products similar to those we sell for these reasons we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide

our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements in particular while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive accordingly we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results financial condition andor cash flows

our future success depends on international sales

nonus sales accounted for approximately 71 of our total revenue in fiscal 2002 70 in fiscal 2001 and 71 in fiscal 2000 we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years international sales are subject to risks including but not limited to

foreign exchange risks 

changing importexport requirements 

foreign trade disputes and 

economic political banking and currency problems in the relevant region 

we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of exchange rate fluctuations on yendenominated sales and assets and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future

a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results

we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes nevertheless the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us suspension of production cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products these regulations could require us to alter our current operations to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations our failure to control the use sale transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities

our ability to manage potential growth or decline integration of potential acquisitions and potential disposition of product lines and technologies creates risks for us

current conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry challenges our management to control spending on operating activities if we experience rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services we may face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls management processes information systems and procedures on a timely basis and training managing and appropriately sizing our work force there can be no assurance that we will be able to perform such actions successfully 

in the future we may make acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies which no longer fit our longterm strategies managing an acquired business disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups diversion of managements attention to other business concerns amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others our success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such growth decline integration of potential acquisitions disposition of product lines or technologies or reduction in personnel or that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations any such inabilities or inadequacies would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products augment our market coverage and distribution ability or enhance our technological capabilities we may acquire additional businesses products or technologies in the future any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations andor the price of our common stock

the market for our common stock is extremely volatile which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions

the market price for our common stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors including but not limited to the following

general market semiconductor or semiconductor equipment industry conditions 

global economic fluctuations 

variations in our quarterly operating results 

variations in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast 

announcements of restructurings technological innovations reductions in force departure of key employees consolidations of operations or introduction of new products 

government regulations 

developments in or claims relating to patent or other proprietary rights 

disruptions with key customers or suppliers or 

political economic or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions 

in addition the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations recent volatility in the price of our common stock was tied in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following volatile periods in the price of stock many companies become the object of securities class action litigation if we are sued in a securities class action we could incur substantial costs and it could divert managements attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our common stock

risk associated with our interest rate swap agreement 

we aim to limit the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our interest rate sensitive investments and debt obligations to minimize the effect of the interest rate exposure associated with our 4 notes we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 300 million we entered into the swap in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our 4 notes attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate by swapping 4 fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the libor based interest rate

if 6month libor based interest rates remain at current levels or decrease we expect the swap will result in interest savings however a rise in 6month libor based interest rates above approximately 5  per annum in future periods could result in incremental levels of interest expense 

the potential antitakeover effects of our bylaws provisions and the rights plan we have in place may affect our stock price and inhibit a change of control desired by some of our stockholders 

in 1997 we adopted a rights plan the rights plan in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our common stock held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on january 31 1997 and thereafter in connection with the adoption of the rights plan our board of directors also adopted a number of amendments to our bylaws including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals

our rights plan may have certain antitakeover effects our rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire lam in certain circumstances accordingly the existence of the rights plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers the rights plan however is not intended to prevent a takeover rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our board of directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders

in addition our certificate of incorporation authorizes issuance of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock our board of directors without further stockholder approval may issue this preferred stock on such terms as the board of directors may determine which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of lam the issuance of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock including causing the loss of voting control moreover section 203 of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders as defined by that statute

intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability

third parties may assert infringement unfair competition or other claims against us additionally from time to time other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights in addition our bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers directors and key employees provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam in such cases it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results

in september 1999 tegal corporation sued us seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents tegal holds specifically tegal identified our 4520xle ä and exelan â products as infringing the patents tegal is asserting litigation is inherently uncertain and we may fail to prevail in this litigation however we believe that the tegal lawsuit will not materially adversely affect our operating results or financial position see part i item 3 of this form 10k for a discussion of the tegal lawsuit

we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights which would affect our business

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents copyrights and trade secret protection we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise continuing our development of new systems increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers however we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications however other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue pending applications in addition the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio and longterm debt obligations we maintain a conservative investment policy which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk the table below presents principal amounts and related weightedaverage interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and longterm debt obligations at june 30 2002 and june 24 2001

we have no cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate 3098 million and 3000 million convertible subordinated notes however we do have cash flow exposures on the interest expense related to our ¥60 billion 485 million at june 30 2002 yendenominated bank term loan because the lending rates under that term loan vary with tibor

we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies as such we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates for this reason we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our yendenominated assets the changes in the fair value of these contracts are adjusted to fair value and recorded in other income and expense in addition we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts we defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 

on june 30 2002 the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was 483 million the unrealized loss on the contracts on june 30 2002 was 08 million a 15 appreciation of the yen would result in an unrealized loss of 85 million while depreciation in the exchange rate of the yen of approximately 15 would result in an unrealized gain of 64 million

on june 30 2002 the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as balance sheet hedges was 137 million the unrealized loss on the contracts on june 30 2002 was 86 thousand a 15 appreciation of the yen would result in an unrealized gain of 24 million depreciation in the exchange rate of the yen of approximately 15 would result in an unrealized loss of 18 million

during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 3000 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the companys 4 notes attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate by swapping 4 fixed interest payments for variable interest rates payments based on the libor based interest rate at june 30 2002 the fair value of the swap 32 million is recorded in other longterm assets an increase in rates by 1 would result in an incremental loss of 99 million a decrease in rates by 1 would result in an incremental gain of 103 million 

during fiscal 1999 we entered into third party option transactions for the purchase and sale of our common stock in order to offset the dilutive effect of a potential conversion into common stock of the 3098 million 5 convertible subordinated notes due september 2 2002 as of june 30 2002 we acquired call options to purchase 372 million shares of our common stock the weightedaverage exercise price of these options is 1129 the call options provide that our maximum benefit at expiration is 1797 per option share the difference between 2926 which is the conversion price of the notes and the weighted average exercise price of the call options we also entered into put option contracts with these same third parties covering 558 million shares of our common stock giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 948 per share on june 1 2002 all but one of these outstanding put option contracts expired as of june 30 2002 we have one remaining put option contract with a third party covering 304 million shares of our common stock giving the third party the right to sell to us shares of our common stock at a weightedaverage price of 932 per share
