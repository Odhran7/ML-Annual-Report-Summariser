food with integrity 

serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to ensuring guests enjoy wholesome food at a great value in our chipotle restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that are raised in accordance with criteria we have established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare and without the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics or added growth hormones we brand these meats as “responsibly raised®” we also seek to use responsibly grown produce by which we mean produce grown by suppliers whose practices conform to our food with integrity standards and our priorities with respect to environmental considerations and employee welfare for more information about our sustainability and animal welfare initiatives see our biennial sustainability report and interim update report on our website wwwchipotlecomaboutussustainability 

purchasing 

maintaining the high levels of quality and safety we demand in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our 25 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality price availability and the suppliers’ understanding of and adherence to our mission we’ve also sought to increase where practical the number of suppliers for our ingredients to help mitigate pricing volatility and reduce our reliance on one or several suppliers which could create supply shortages in addition we closely monitor industry news trade tariffs weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients  certain cuts of beef tomatoes tortillas and adobo  are purchased from a small number of suppliers 

quality assurance and food safety 

we are committed to serving only safe high quality food our food safety and quality assurance teams work to ensure compliance with our food safety programs and practices components of which include 

 natural inhibitors to prevent microbial growth in ingredients 

 advanced technologies tools that reduce or eliminate pathogens while maintaining food quality 

 small grower support and training 

 enhanced restaurant procedures protocols for handling ingredients and sanitizing surfaces in our restaurants 

 food safety certifications 

 internal and thirdparty restaurant inspections 

 supplier interventions steps to mitigate food safety risks before ingredients reach chipotle and 

 ingredient traceability 

these and other food safety practices underscore our commitment to be a leader in food safety while continuing to serve high quality food that our guests love our food safety and quality assurance teams establish and monitor our quality and food safety programs and work closely with suppliers to ensure our high standards are met throughout the supply chain we maintain a limited list of approved suppliers  many of whom are among the top suppliers in the industry in addition we have a team approach where our training operations culinary legal and restaurant food safety and quality assurance departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality food preparation restaurant cleanliness employee health protocols and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also intended to ensure that we not only continue to comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations but also establish chipotle as an industry leader in food safety to help achieve this goal we have a food safety advisory council comprised of some of the nation’s foremost food safety authorities the food safety advisory council is charged with evaluating our programs and advising us on ways to elevate our already high standards for food safety our food safety and quality assurance team members hold board seats and participate in technical working groups with several associations this gives us the opportunity to learn and share our knowledge and expertise with other food safety professionals and regulatory agencies 

digital business 

our digital platform continues to be a strategic driver of our growth we have significantly upgraded our capabilities by digitizing almost all of our restaurant kitchens expanding our partnerships with thirdparty delivery services and building more chipotlanes which is our drive through format for customer pickup of digital orders digital sales which includes delivery and customer pickup represented 456 of our total revenue in 2021 compared to 462 of total revenue in 2020 our strong digital platform gave us a competitive advantage during the peaks of the covid19 pandemic as more guests preferred to eat their meals at home and inrestaurant dining was prohibited or restricted we have made digital ordering convenient with enhancements to the chipotle app and website such as unlimited customization contactless delivery and group ordering

total rewards 

the financial physical and mental wellness of our employees remains our top priority during 2021 we conducted an independent pay equity analysis of our us workforce to identify risks and pay gaps in our organization by gender and raceethnicity to support our commitment to pay our employees equally across gender and raceethnicity the results of the 2021 analysis did not identify preferential treatment to any class of employee however we identified several isolated discrepancies between actual compensation and our policies and we quickly made pay adjustments to close all identified gaps our commitment to pay equity is evidenced by our investment in our compensation packages and robust suite of benefit offerings such as 

 elig ible crew members who work at locations that meet team sales and output goals may qualify for a quarterly crew bonus equivalent to one week’s worth of pay on average in addition to quarterly performance bonuses fulltime crew members with at least one continuous year of service may be eligible for an annual bonus in 2021 we paid out 67 million across these bonus programs

competition 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste  price food quality and presentation service location convenience brand reputation cleanliness and ambience of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locallyowned restaurants as well as national and regional chains competition from food delivery services which offer meals from a wide variety of restaurants also has increased in recent years particularly during covid19 and is expected to continue to increase many of our competitors also offer dinein carryout online catering and delivery services among our main competitors are restaurant formats that claim to serve higher quality ingredients without artificial flavors colors and preservatives and that serve food quickly and at a reasonable price

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes if any of the risks and uncertainties described below actually occur or continue to occur our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies including but not limited to overall economic and industry conditions additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may arise or become material and may negatively impact our business reputation financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results operations and outlook for an extended period of time 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations during the peak of the pandemic in 2020 and during subsequent resurgences of the virus government restrictions have required us to close some of our restaurants close dining rooms and offer only takeout and delivery impose social distancing require proof of vaccinations and enforce the wearing of face coverings in addition the covid19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make difficult decisions about covid19 protective measures such as requiring employees and guests to be vaccinated andor wear face coverings which could impact our brand employee satisfaction hiring and retention and the willingness of guests to frequent our restaurants 

our restaurant operations have been and could continue to be disrupted by employees who are unable or unwilling to work whether because of illness quarantine fear of contracting covid19 or caring for family members impacted by covid19 the socalled “great resignation” trend that began in 2021 in which us employees voluntarily resigned from their jobs in large numbers has further strained our ability to keep our restaurants fully staffed and negatively impacted employee satisfaction 

the covid19 outbreak also has impacted and is likely to continue to impact our supply chain which could negatively impact our business these impacts could include but are not limited to disruptions in our ability to obtain ingredients packaging and cleaning supplies due to labor shortages at our suppliers and service providers transportation bottlenecks or increases in raw material and commodity costs if our suppliers do not fulfill their obligations to us we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our results of operations and sales could be adversely impacted 

we cannot predict the impact that resurgences of the covid19 virus and new variants of the virus will have on the overall economy and consumer behavior or how long those impacts may last so we cannot predict how long our results of operations and financial performance will be adversely impacted 

risks related to human capital 

if we are not able to hire train reward and retain qualified restaurant employees andor appropriately plan our workforce our growth plan and profitability could be adversely affected 

we rely on our restaurantlevel employees to consistently provide highquality food and positive experiences to our guests in addition our ability to continue to open new restaurants depends on us recruiting training and retaining highquality employees to manage and work in our restaurants maintaining appropriate staffing in our restaurants requires precise workforce planning which has become more complex due to predictive scheduling “fair workweek” or “secure scheduling” laws and “just cause” termination legislation in certain geographic areas where we operate and the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the socalled “great resignation” trend on relevant labor markets the market for qualified talent continues to be competitive and we must provide increasingly competitive wages benefits and workplace conditions to retain qualified employees we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in recruiting and retaining restaurant employees and in maintaining full restaurant staffing in various locations which has resulted in longer wait times for guest orders temporary closures of the digital make line and decreased employee satisfaction a shortage of qualified candidates who meet all legal work authorization requirements our failure to recruit and retain new restaurant employees in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels could affect our ability to open new restaurants grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives in addition failure to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization efforts which could negatively impact our ability to meet our growth targets 

  

  

if we fail to comply with applicable federal state and local employment and labor laws and regulations it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

various federal state and local employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees and similar laws and regulations apply to our operations outside of the us these laws and regulations relate to matters such as employment discrimination wage and hour laws predictive scheduling “fair workweek” and “just cause” termination laws requirements to provide and document meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules healthcare laws and antidiscrimination and antiharassment laws we incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations and noncompliance could expose us to significant liabilities for example previously a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee classification employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we incur legal costs to defend and we could incur losses from these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant 

in addition several jurisdictions including new york city philadelphia chicago seattle oregon san francisco and san jose have implemented fair workweek or “secure scheduling” legislation which impose complex requirements related to scheduling for certain restaurant and retail employees and additional jurisdictions are considering similar legislation several jurisdictions also have implemented sick paypaid time off legislation which requires employers to provide paid time off to employees and “just cause” termination legislation which restricts companies’ ability to terminate employees unless they can prove “just cause” or a “bona fide economic reason” for the termination all of these regulations impose additional obligations on us and our failure to comply with any of these regulations could subject us to penalties and other legal liabilities which could adversely affect our business and results of operations and potentially cause us to close or reduce operating hours of some restaurants in these jurisdictions for example we previously reported that a complaint has been filed against us alleging that we have violated new york city’s fair work week law and earned safe and sick time act at our restaurants in new york city we also have been subject to several audits of our compliance with employment law requirements in other cities 

difficulties in hiring qualified employees and increases in the cost of labor could adversely impact our business and profitability 

our business has been and could continue to be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs caused by factors such as federal state and local laws governing matters such as minimum wages meal and rest breaks and changes to eligibility for overtime pay regulations regarding scheduling and benefits increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs higher wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract hire and retain highquality employees with the right skill sets in a highly competitive job market and increased wages benefits and costs related to the covid19 pandemic our ability to offset higher labor costs by increasing menu prices depends on the willingness of our guests to pay the higher prices and the perceived value of our meals relative to competitors if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting higher labor costs by increased menu prices our profitability may decline 

additionally while our employees are not currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize our employees and those of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to unionize our labor costs could increase and it could negatively impact our culture reduce our flexibility and disrupt our business in addition our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact our reputation and dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants 

  

  

risks related to the nature of our business and the restaurant industry 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business by decreasing sales and increasing costs 

food safety is our top priority and we dedicate significant resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe highquality food products however even with strong preventative controls and interventions food safety risks cannot be completely eliminated in any restaurant and incidents of foodborne illnesses continue to occur in the restaurant industry incidents may result from the failure of restaurant employees or suppliers to follow our food safety policies and procedures or from employees or guests entering our restaurant while ill and contaminating ingredients or surfaces although we monitor and audit compliance with our program we cannot guarantee that each and every food item is safely and properly maintained from the start of the supply chain through guest consumption any report legitimate or otherwise of foodborne illness such as e coli hepatitis a norovirus or salmonella or other food safety issue such as food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect our reputation and have a negative impact on our sales in addition instances of foodborne illness or food safety issues that occur solely at competitors’ restaurants could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry and adversely impact our sales social media has dramatically increased the speed with which negative publicity including actual or perceived food safety incidents is disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to investigate respond and address an issue the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

we may be more susceptible than our competitors to incur significant negative consequences from food safety incidents due to several highly publicized food safety events that previously occurred in our restaurants from 2015 to 2018 illnesses caused by e coli and c perfringens bacteria and norovirus were connected to a number of our restaurants these incidents and the related negative publicity had a significant negative impact on our sales and profitability for those years because of consumer perceptions in the wake of these food safety incidents any future food safety incidents associated with our restaurants—even incidents that would be considered minor at other restaurants—may have a more significant negative impact on our sales and our ability to retain guests in addition we may be at a higher risk for food safety incidents than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh unprocessed produce handling of raw chicken in our restaurants our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation and our avoidance of frozen ingredients the risk of illnesses associated with our food also may increase due to the growth of our delivery or catering businesses in which our food is transported stored andor served in conditions that are not under our control all of these factors could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain guests which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 

our delivery business which accounted for a significant portion of our 2021 total revenue is subject to risks 

in 2021 456 of our total revenue was derived from digital orders which includes delivery and customer pickup inrestaurant and through our chipotlanes approximately 215 of our 2021 total revenue consisted of delivery orders for which we are reliant on thirdparty delivery companies depending on which ordering platform a guest uses – our platform or the platform of a thirdparty delivery service – the delivery fee we collect from the guest may be less than the actual delivery cost which has a negative impact on our profitability in 2021 we implemented several menu price increases to partially offset the increases in higher delivery labor and other costs however our higher menu prices may cause some guests to shift their purchases to other restaurants offered on the platform these delivery companies maintain control over data regarding our guests who use their platform and over the guest experience if a thirdparty delivery driver fails to make timely deliveries or fails to deliver the complete order our guests may attribute the bad customer experience to chipotle and could stop ordering from us the ordering and payment platforms used by these thirdparties or our mobile app or online ordering system could be interrupted by technological failures user errors cyberattacks or other factors which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our overall sales and reputation the thirdparty delivery business is intensely competitive with a number of players competing for market share online traffic capital and delivery drivers if the thirdparty delivery companies we utilize cease or curtail operations increase their fees or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted the delivery business has been consolidating and may continue to consolidate which may give thirdparty delivery companies more leverage in negotiating the terms and pricing of contracts which in turn could negatively impact our profits from this channel 

  

  

the restaurant industry is highly competitive if we are not able to compete successfully our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to taste preferences price food quality and selection customer service brand reputation digital engagement advertising and promotional initiatives and the location attractiveness and maintenance of restaurants we also compete with a number of nontraditional market participants such as convenience stores grocery stores coffee shops meal kit delivery services and “ghost” or “dark” kitchens where meals are prepared at separate takeaway premises rather than a restaurant competition from food delivery services which promote a wide variety of restaurant options on their sites also has increased in recent years particularly during the covid19 pandemic increased competition could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability and development plans if consumer or dietary preferences change if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other restaurant outlets our business could be adversely affected 

we continue to believe that our commitment to higherquality and responsibly sourced ingredients resonates with guests and gives us a competitive advantage however more competitors have made and continue to make claims related to the quality of their ingredients and lack of artificial flavors colors and preservatives the increasing use of these claims by competitors regardless of the accuracy of such claims may lessen our differentiation and make it more difficult for us to compete if we are unable to continue to maintain our distinctiveness and compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the immediacy of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

social media and internetbased communications including videosharing social networking and messaging platforms give users immediate access to a broad audience these platforms have dramatically increased the speed of dissemination and accessibility of information including negative publicity related to food safety incidents and negative guest and employee experiences accurate and inaccurate or misleading information can be widely disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond or address an issue as a result of our highly publicized food safety incidents in 2015  2018 negative social media posts about our business may generate a disproportionately negative response than would be experienced by other companies without a similar history it is impossible for us to fully predict or control social media backlash which could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy 

use of social media is an important element of our marketing efforts new social media platforms are developing rapidly and we need to continuously innovate and evolve our social media strategies to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives to reach our guests and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to us including our “chipotle rewards” national loyalty program these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased customer engagement or brand recognition other risks associated with our use of social media include association with influencers or online celebrities who become embroiled in controversy improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information the inappropriate use of social media by our guests or employees could lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

if w e do not continue to persuade consumers of the benefits of paying higher prices for our higher quality food our sales and results of operations could be hurt  

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade consumers that food made with ingredients that were raised or grown according to our food with integrity principles is worth paying a higher price relative to prices of some of our competitors particularly quickservice restaurant competitors under our food with integrity principles for example animals must be responsibly raised and the milk in our sour cream cheese and queso must come from cows that have not been treated with rbgh which practices typically are more costly than conventional farming if we are not able to successfully persuade consumers that consuming food made consistent with our food with integrity principles is better for them and the environment or if consumers are not willing to pay the prices we charge our sales could be adversely affected which would negatively impact our results of operations 

  

  

risks related to supply chain 

increases in the costs of ingredient and other materials including increases caused by the covid19 pandemic climate andor other sustainability risks could adversely affect our results of operations 

supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of ingredients and supplies that are critical to our restaurant operations the markets for some of our ingredients such as beef avocado and other produce are particularly volatile due to factors beyond our control such as limited sources seasonal shifts climate conditions and industry demand including as a result of animal disease outbreaks international commodity markets food safety concerns product recalls and government regulation in addition for certain of our ingredients and other materials we have a limited number of suppliers and distributors we remain in regular contact with our major suppliers and to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain however in the latter part of 2021 costs for certain supplies and ingredients such as packaging beef tortillas and freight increased materially and rapidly which inflationary pressures could continue andor spread to more categories as the impacts of covid19 continue across the global supply chain our efforts to mitigate future price risk through forward contracts careful planning and other activities may not fully insulate us from increases in commodity costs which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we also could be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our responsibly raised animal welfare criteria and ingredients grown in accordance with our food with integrity specifications the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for conventionally raised or grown ingredients any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef dairy for cheese and sour cream avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would have a particularly adverse effect on our operating results if the cost of one or more ingredients significantly increases we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items that use those ingredients such as guacamole or one of our proteins rather than pay the increased cost any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and could adversely impact our sales and brand 

shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients could adversely affect our operating results 

our business is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of ingredients that comply with our food with integrity specifications we may experience shortages delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants due to inclement weather natural disasters labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers distributors or transportation providers or other conditions beyond our control in addition we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients including certain cuts of beef tomatoes tortillas and adobo although we believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of ingredients shortages or interruptions in our supply of ingredients could adversely affect our financial results 

risks related to it systems cybersecurity and data privacy 

breaches or other unauthorized access theft modification or destruction of confidential guest employee and other material confidential information that is stored in our systems or by third parties on our behalf could adversely affect our business 

we could experience a cyber incident which generally refers to any intentional attack or an unintentional event that results in unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal or expose confidential information or intellectual property or a ransomware attack which is a type of malicious software that infects a computer and restricts users access to it until a ransom is paid to unlock it any such incident that compromises the information of our guests or employees could result in widespread negative publicity damage to our reputation a loss of guests disruption of our business and legal liabilities if any of our critical suppliers is the subject of a cyber or ransomware attack we could experience a significant disruption in our supply chain and possibly shortages of key ingredients in the past year a ransomware attack on one of our key suppliers required us to revert to a manual ordering and tracking process which resulted in some delays and reduced efficiencies 

as our reliance on technology has grown the scope and severity of risks posed to our systems from cyber threats has increased in addition as more business activities have shifted online and more people are working remotely including as a result of covid19 we have experienced an increase in cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse malware and other events that could have a security impact however there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective 

  

  

the majority of our restaurant sales are made by credit or debit cards and we also maintain personal information regarding our employees and confidential information about our guests and suppliers we segment our card data environment and employ a cyber security protection program that is based on proven industry frameworks including cyber security techniques tactics and procedures such as the deployment of a robust set of security controls continuous monitoring and detection programs network protections vendor selection criteria secure software development programs and ongoing employee training awareness and incident response preparedness in addition we continuously scan our environment for any vulnerabilities perform penetration testing engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our security measures and collaborate with members of the cyber security community however there are no assurances that such programs will be effective in detecting or preventing cybersecurity breaches 

from time to time we have been and likely will continue to be the target of cyber and other security threats for example some of our guests have experienced account takeover fraud in which guests use the same log in credentials on multiple websites and when a third party fraudulently obtains those credentials from one website they can gain unauthorized access to their accounts on our website and charge food orders to the credit card linked to the account without accessing credit card data we may in the future become subject to other legal proceedings or governmental investigations for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of data or if consumer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately any such claim or proceeding or any adverse publicity resulting from such an event may have a material adverse effect on our business and we may incur significant remediation costs 

we may incur increased costs to comply with privacy and data protection laws and if we fail to comply we could be subject to government enforcement actions private litigation and adverse publicity 

complex local state federal and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue additionally the california privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which became effective on january 1 2020 provides a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information of california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions further the california privacy rights act which was passed in november 2020 and is fully effective on january 1 2023 significantly modifies the ccpa these modifications will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply virginia and colorado recently enacted similar data privacy legislation that will take effect in 2023 and several other states and countries are considering expanding or passing privacy laws in the near term if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of our or a third party’s information technology systems or fail to properly respond to consumer requests under the ccpa we could experience reputational damage adverse publicity loss of consumer confidence reduced sales and profits complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk including criminal penalties or civil liabilities in july 2021 the european commission finalized recommendations in relation to crossborder data transfers and published new versions of the standard contractual clauses together with the finalization of brexit in april 2021 the new requirements will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in order to comply and may impact the transfer of personal data throughout our organization and to third parties 

compliance with the current and future privacy and data protection laws can be costly and timeconsuming and there is no assurance that our compliance efforts will be successful in preventing breaches or data loss our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals fines or damage to our brand reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business 

the regulatory environment related to privacy and data security is changing at an everincreasing pace with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business in addition many of the leading thirdparty tech platforms are moving away from thirdparty cookies such as ours and moving to their own required frameworks which may hinder our ability to target our marketing efforts along with newly developed laws and regulations the frameworks of these tech platforms are subject to change carry uncertain interpretations and may be inconsistent in application which may lead to a decline in guest engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs or modifications to our operations or business practices to comply 

  

  

we rely heavily on information technology systems and failures or interruptions in our it systems could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information technology systems including the pointofsale and payment processing system in our restaurants technologies supporting our digital and delivery business technologies that traceback ingredients to suppliers and growers and manage our supply chain our rewards program technologies that facilitate marketing initiatives employee engagement and payroll processing and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the procurement production distribution safety and sale of our products depends significantly on the availability reliability and security of these systems many of these critical systems are provided and managed by third parties and we are reliant on these thirdparty providers to implement protective measures that ensure the security and availability of their systems although we have operational safeguards in place these safeguards may not be effective in preventing the failure of these thirdparty systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events physical theft computer and network failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in thirdparty software or services errors or improper use by our employees or the thirdparty service providers if any of our critical it systems were to become unreliable unavailable compromised or otherwise fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner we could experience an interruption in our operations that could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 

our inability or failure to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan at our restaurant support centers following a disaster or force majeure event could have a material adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address crisislevel events including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information and the covid19 pandemic has provided a limited test of our ability to manage our business remotely however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims in addition these threats are constantly evolving which increases the difficulty of accurately and timely predicting planning for and protecting against the threat as a result our disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans security may not adequately address all threats we face or protect us from loss 

legal and regulatory risks 

a violation of chipotle’s deferred prosecution agreement could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in april 2020 chipotle signed a deferred prosecution agreement the “dpa” to settle an official criminal investigation conducted by the us attorney’s office for the central district of california in conjunction with the us food and drug administration’s office of criminal investigations collectively the “doj” into companywide food safety matters that occurred in our restaurants dating back to january 1 2013 pursuant to the dpa the doj filed a twocount class a misdemeanor information in the united states district court for the central district of california charging chipotle with adulterating and causing food to be adulterated within the meaning of the federal food drug and cosmetic act while such food was held for sale under the dpa chipotle paid a fine and is required to maintain a comprehensive compliance program that is designed to ensure chipotle complies with all applicable federal and state food safety laws the doj agreed that if chipotle is in full compliance with all of its obligations under the dpa at the conclusion of the threeyear deferred prosecution term the doj will move to dismiss the twocount information filed against chipotle full compliance with the dpa requires among other things chipotle to conduct a root cause analysis of the historic food safety matters maintain and annually update a comprehensive food safety plan and comply with applicable provisions of the fdca 

chipotle owns and operates over 2900 restaurants and we dedicate substantial resources to our food safety program however even with strong preventative controls and interventions food safety risks cannot be completely eliminated in any restaurant food safety risks may arise due to possible failures by restaurant employees or suppliers to follow food safety policies and procedures employees or guests coming to the restaurant while ill or serving contaminated food ingredients if chipotle is found to have breached the terms of the dpa the doj may elect to prosecute or bring a civil action against the company for conduct alleged in the dpa’s statement of facts which could result in additional fines penalties and have material adverse impacts on our results of operations in addition further action by the doj may significantly and adversely affect our brand and reputation especially in light of our highly publicized food safety incidents in 2015 – 2018 

  

  

we could be party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business results of operations and reputation 

we have been and likely will continue to be subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business these legal proceedings may involve claims brought by employees guests government agencies suppliers shareholders or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these legal proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour employment of minors discrimination harassment wrongful termination and vacation and family leave laws food safety issues including foodborne illness food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of our food products data security or privacy breaches guest discrimination personal injury in our restaurants trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns for example a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state employment laws including wage and hour claims and in 2020 we signed a dpa with the us attorney’s office for the central district of california referred to earlier we could be involved in similar or even more significant litigation and legal proceedings in the future even if the allegations against us in current or future legal matters are unfounded or we ultimately are not held liable the costs to defend ourselves may be significant and the litigation may subject us to substantial settlements fines penalties or judgments against us and may divert managements attention away from operating our business all of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations litigation also may generate negative publicity regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are liable which could damage our reputation and adversely impact our sales and our relationship with our employees and guests 

we are subject to extensive laws government regulation and other legal requirements and our failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could adversely affect our operational efficiencies ability to attract and retain talent and results of operations 

our business is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations including those relating to 

 preparation sale and labeling of food including regulations of the food and drug administration which oversees the safety of the entire food system including inspections and mandatory food recalls menu labeling and nutritional content 

 employment practices and working conditions including minimum wage rates wage and hour practices fair workweek and “just cause” legislation employment of minors discrimination harassment classification of employees paid and family leave workplace safety immigration and overtime among others 

 health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages 

 building and zoning requirements including state and local licensing and regulation governing the design and operation of facilities and land use 

 public accommodations and safety conditions including the americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas 

 data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information and payment card industry standards and requirements 

 environmental matters such as emissions and air quality water consumption the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances and local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants and 

 public company compliance disclosure and governance matters including accounting and tax regulations sec and nyse disclosure requirements 

compliance with these laws and regulations and future new laws or changes in these laws or regulations that impose additional requirements can be costly any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

  

  

risks related to our growth and business strategy 

if we are unable to meet our projections for new restaurant openings or efficiently maintain the attractiveness of our existing restaurants our profitability could suffer 

our growth depends on our ability to open new restaurants and operate them profitably since 2020 covid19 related disruptions in the global supply chain have increased the cost and decreased the availability of construction materials and restaurant equipment needed to open and operate our restaurants which can delay the openings of new restaurants in addition we incur substantial startup expenses each time we open a new restaurant and it can take up to 24 months to ramp up the sales and profitability of a new restaurant during which time costs may be higher as we train new employees and build up a customer base if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect or fail to overcome the higher startup expenses associated with new restaurants our new restaurants may not be as profitable as our existing restaurants our ability to open and profitably operate new restaurants also is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of desirable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease terms the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses and comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of capable contractors and subcontractors increases in the cost and decreases in the availability of labor and building material changes in weather natural disasters pandemics or other acts of god that could delay construction and adversely affect guest traffic our ability to hire and train qualified management and restaurant employees and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

in addition in an effort to increase samerestaurant sales and improve our operating performance we continue to improve our existing restaurants through remodels upgrades and regular upkeep if the costs associated with remodels upgrades or regular upkeep are higher than anticipated restaurants are closed for remodeling for longer periods than planned or remodeled restaurants do not perform as expected we may not realize our projected desired return on investment which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

substantially all of our restaurants operate in leased properties subject to longterm leases if we are unable to secure new leases on favorable terms terminate unfavorable leases or renew or extend favorable leases our profitability may suffer 

we operate substantially all of our restaurants in leased facilities it is becoming increasingly challenging to locate and secure favorable lease facilities for new restaurants as competition for restaurant sites in our target markets is intense development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors could negatively impact our ability to manage our occupancy costs which may adversely impact our profitability in addition any of these factors may be exacerbated by economic factors which may result in an increased demand for developers and contractors that could drive up our construction and leasing costs also as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our existing restaurant base will decline making it increasingly difficult to achieve levels of sales and profitability growth that we achieved in prior years 

from time to time we may close or relocate a restaurant if a current location becomes less profitable as a result of adverse economic conditions or local regulatory compliance in the area we may incur significant lease termination expenses when we close or relocate a restaurant and are often obligated to continue to pay rent and other leaserelated expenses after closing a restaurant we also may incur significant asset impairment and other charges in connection with closures and relocations if the lease termination cost is significant we may decide to keep underperforming restaurants open ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could decrease our results of operations in addition we may be unable to renew a lease without substantial additional cost at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks that may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

our failure to effectively manage and support our growth could have a negative adverse effect on our business and financial results 

as of december 31 2021 we owned and operated 2962 chipotle restaurants and we plan to open a significant number of new restaurants in the next several years our existing restaurant management systems back office technology systems and processes financial and management controls information systems and personnel may not be adequate to support our continued growth to effectively manage a larger number of restaurants we may need to upgrade and expand our infrastructure and information systems automate more processes that currently are manual or require manual intervention and hire train and retain restaurant employees and corporate support staff all of which may result in increased costs and at least temporary inefficiencies we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success and as we continue to grow it may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture our failure to sufficiently invest in our infrastructure and information systems and maintain our strong staffing and culture could harm our brand and operating results 

  

  

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic growth plans and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

our ability to continue to grow our business depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive leadership team and other key management personnel changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support our strategic initiatives or to build adequate bench strength with key skillsets required for seamless succession of leadership could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets if we are unable to attract develop retain and incentivize sufficiently experienced and capable management personnel our business and financial results may suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be more volatile than the market price of our peers 

we believe the market price of our common stock generally has traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most of our peer companies as well as the overall market which typically has reflected market expectations for higher future operating results at any given point in time our priceearnings ratio may trade at more than twice the priceearnings ratio of the sp 500 also the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times including as a result of adverse publicity events as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

general risk factors 

economic and business factors that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and the results of our operations 

restaurant dining generally is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending which may be affected by general economic conditions that are beyond our control for example increasing inflation international domestic and regional economic conditions consumer income levels financial market volatility a slow or stagnant pace of economic growth rising energy costs rising interest rates social unrest and governmental political and budget concerns or divisions may have a negative effect on consumer confidence and discretionary spending due to the covid19 pandemic we may experience a reduction andor increased volatility in sales due to among other things reduced customer traffic due to illness quarantine or government or selfimposed restrictions on our restaurant operations customer responses to government imposed mask and vaccine mandates and decreases in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and in discretionary spending the rapid rise in inflation may prompt consumers to decrease discretionary spending a significant decrease in our guest traffic or average transactions would negatively impact our financial performance the actual or perceived threat of a pandemic or communicable disease terrorist attack mass shooting heightened security requirements including cybersecurity or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could harm our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of the above factors or other unfavorable changes in business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or limit our ability to increase pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations these factors also could cause us to among other things reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings close restaurants or delay remodeling of our existing restaurant locations further poor economic conditions may force nearby businesses to shut down which could reduce traffic to our restaurants or cause our restaurant locations to be less attractive 

climate change and volatile adverse weather conditions could adversely affect our restaurant sales or results of operations 

there is growing concern that climate change and global warming has caused and may continue to cause more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations adverse weather conditions have in the past and may again impact guest traffic at our restaurants and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes wildfires or other natural disasters cause temporary restaurant closures all of which negatively impact our restaurant sales in addition our supply chain is subject to increased costs caused by the effects of climate change greenhouse gases and diminishing energy and water resources increasing weather volatility and changes in global weather patterns can reduce crop size and crop quality which could result in decreased availability or higher pricing for our produce and other ingredients these factors are beyond our control and in many instances unpredictable climate change and government regulation relating to climate change could result in construction delays for new restaurants and interruptions to the availability or increases in the cost of utilities the ongoing and longterm costs of these impacts related to climate change and other sustainability related issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we are not able to mitigate them 

  

  

our quarterly financial results may fluctuate significantly including due to factors that are not in our control 

our quarterly financial results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet investors’ expectations for various reasons including 

 neg ative publicity about the safety of our food employmentrelated issues litigation or other issues involving our restaurants 

 fluctuations in supply costs particularly for our most significant ingredients and our inability to offset the higher cost with price increases without adversely impacting guest traffic 

 labor availability and wages of restaurant management and employees 

 increases in marketing or promotional expenses 

 the timing of new restaurant openings and related revenues and expenses and the operating costs at newly opened restaurants 

 the impact of inclement weather and natural disasters such as freezes and droughts which could decrease guest traffic and increase the costs of ingredients 

 the amount and timing of stockbased compensation 

 litigation settlement costs and related legal expenses 

 tax expenses asset impairment charges and nonoperating costs and 

 variations in general economic conditions including the impact of declining interest rates on our interest income 

as a result of any of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease

overview 

as of december 31 2021 we operated 2918 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states 44 international chipotle restaurants and four nonchipotle restaurants we manage our us operations based on eight regions and have aggregated our operations to one reportable segment 

throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics which we believe will drive our financial results and longterm growth model w e believe these metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies 

 comparable restaurant sales 

 restaurant operating costs as a percentage of total revenue 

 new restaurant openings 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our operations and financial results for the foreseeable future we continue to follow guidance from health officials in determining the appropriate restrictions to put in place for each restaurant our restaurant operations have been and could continue to be disrupted by covid19 related employee absences or due to changes in the availability and cost of labor we remain in regular contact with our major suppliers and to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain however we have experienced inflationary pressures in freight and the costs of some of our ingredients and temporary shortages in equipment and other goods which could increase andor spread to more categories as the impacts of covid19 continue across the global supply chain we anticipate the restaurant wage increases implemented in june 2021 and any future wage increases in the us along with increased supply chain costs primarily related to inflationary pressures that began in the latter half of 2021 will have an impact on restaurant operating costs in 2022 however these should be offset to some extent by benefits from pricing actions leverage from revenue growth and supply chain initiatives 

2021 financial highlights 

sales trends average restaurant sales were 2641 million for the year ended december 31 2021 an increase from 2223 million for the year ended december 31 2020 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month food and beverage sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months 

total revenue was 75 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 an increase of 261 from 60 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was attributable to comparable restaurant sales and to a lesser extent new restaurant openings comparable restaurant sales increased 193 for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to a 103 increase in transactions and an 85 benefit from menu price increases implemented in late 2020 and during 2021 comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales or transactions for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months 

digital sales which includes delivery and customer pickup were 34 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 and represented 456 of total revenue compared to 462 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 higher volumes of instore transactions in 2021 contributed to the decrease in digital sales as a percentage of total revenue order ahead sales were 509 and 499 of digital sales for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

during 2021 we completed several company initiatives which we believe contributed to sales growth these initiatives included the launch of cauliflower rice in january 2021 digital launch of quesadillas in march 2021 and smoked brisket in september 2021 additionally in june 2021 we enhanced our loyalty program chipotle rewards by introducing new redemption options and personalized offers primarily targeted at new and atrisk customers 

  

  

restaurant operating costs  during the year ended december 31 2021 our restaurant operating costs food beverage and packaging labor occupancy and other operating costs were 774 of total revenue a decrease from 826 during the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was driven primarily by higher comparable restaurant sales partially offset by wage inflation higher commodity inflation primarily from freight and beef and to a lesser extent increased delivery fees 

diluted earnings per share during the year ended december 31 2021 our diluted earnings per share were 2290 an 829 increase from 1252 in 2020 

restaurant development for the full year 2021 we opened 215 new restaurants which included 174 restaurants with a chipotlane we expect to open approximately 235250 new restaurants in 2022 including five to 10 relocations of which we are targeting 80 with a chipotlane 

restaurant activity 

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 



results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of total revenue and periodoverperiod change are discussed in the following section 

revenue 



the significant factors contributing to the total revenue increase for the year ended december 31  2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 were comparable restaurant sales increases and new restaurant openings comparable restaurant sales increased 11282 million and total revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed 4341 million to the total revenue increase of which 2019 million was due to restaurants opened in 2021 

food beverage and packaging costs   



food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to sales leverage from menu price increases this decrease was partially offset by higher costs for freight and beef and to a lesser extent higher costs for avocados 

  

  

labor costs 



labor costs decreased as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to sales leverage and to a lesser extent lower covid19 related pay for restaurant employees this decrease was partially offset primarily by wage inflation from increasing restaurant wages to a 1500 national average hourly wage for our restaurant employees implemented across all restaurants by june 30 2021  

occupancy costs   



occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to sales leverage partially offset by increased rent expense associated with new restaurants 

other operating costs 



other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs delivery expense bank and credit card processing fees restaurant utilities and maintenance costs other operating costs decreased as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to sales leverage and to a lesser extent lower marketing and promotional expense these decreases were partially offset by higher delivery and technology expense 

general and administrative expenses 



general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to the following a 928 million increase in stockbased compensation primarily attributable to the december 2020 modification of 2018 performance awards related to covid19 a 232 million increase in outside services expense related to corporate initiatives an 118 million increase in performance bonuses and a 96 million increase in employee wages primarily due to headcount growth these increases were partially offset by a 171 million decrease in estimated loss contingencies related to legal matters in 2021 compared to 2020 

  

  

depreciation and amortization 



depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to sales leverage 

impairment closure costs and asset disposals 



impairment closure costs and asset disposals decreased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to a comparison against elevated impairments of operating lease assets and leasehold improvements in 2020 these elevated impairments in 2020 were primarily the result of the covid19 pandemic negatively impacting our nearterm restaurant level cash flow forecasts 

benefitprovision for income taxes 



the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 was higher than the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to comparing against the federal net operating loss for tax year 2020 which had a statutory federal income tax rate of 21 that was carried back to tax years 20152017 which had a statutory federal income tax rate of 35 there is a further increase in the effective income tax rate due to the proportionality of the excess tax benefits from equity vesting and exercises relative to profit before tax in each respective year this was partially offset by a net reduction in the 2021 effective income tax rate primarily related to the writeoff of uncertain tax positions reserves for the year ended december 31 2021 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way worldwide health pandemics fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases or promotional activities and other marketing initiatives the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results although on an overall annual basis changes in trading days do not have a significant impact 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of non cash stockbased compensation expense and related tax rate impacts litigation settlement costs and related legal expenses impairment charges and nonoperating costs timing of marketing or promotional expenses the number and timing of new restaurants opened in a quarter and closure of restaurants new restaurants typically have higher operating costs following opening because of the expenses associated with their opening and operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2021 we had a cash and marketable investments balance of 13 billion excluding restricted cash of 309 million and nonmarketable investments of 432 million after funding the current operations in our restaurants and support centers the first planned use of our cash flow from operations is to provide capital for the continued investment in new restaurant construction in addition to continuing to invest in our restaurant expansion we expect to utilize cash flow from operations to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions invest in maintain and refurbish our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2021 2409 million remained available for repurchases of shares of our common stock which includes the 2000 million additional authorization approved by our board of directors and announced on february 8 2022 under the remaining repurchase authorizations shares may be purchased in open market transactions subject to market conditions additionally as of december 31 2021 we had 5000 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under a line of credit facility 

we believe that cash from operations together with our cash and investment balances will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future assuming no significant declines in comparable restaurant sales we expect we will generate positive cash flow for the foreseeable future should our business deteriorate due to changing conditions there are actions we can take to further conserve liquidity 

we have not required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverages and supplies sometime after the receipt of those items within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

our total capital expenditures for 2021 were 4425 million in 2021 we spent on average about 11 million in development and construction costs per new restaurant or about 10 million net of landlord reimbursements of 01 million in 2022 we expect to incur about 450 million in total capital expenditures we expect approximately 260 million in capital expenditures related to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements for new restaurants to be opened in 2022 we anticipate average development costs will remain consistent with 2021 due to a significant portion including chipotlanes we expect approximately 150 million in capital expenditures related to investments in existing restaurants including new equipment and hardware technology to optimize efficiencies remodeling and similar improvements finally we expect a portion of our incurred capital expenditures to be for additional corporate initiatives including investments in technology for support centers to boost innovation enhance the customer experience and improve operations 

the following table summarizes current and longterm material cash requirements as of december 31 2021 which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows  



1 see note 10 “leases” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” this includes commitments related to reasonably certain renewal periods 

2 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty the majority of our purchase obligations relate to amounts owed for produce and other ingredients and supplies orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction and planned remodels information technology and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships 

the above table does not include income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments additionally we have excluded our estimated loss contingencies due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of payment see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors 

leases 

we determine if a contract contains a lease at inception our material operating leases consist of restaurant locations and office space our leases generally have remaining terms of 120 years and most include options to extend the leases for additional 5year periods generally the lease term is the minimum of the noncancelable period of the lease or the lease term inclusive of reasonably certain renewal periods up to a term of 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably certain lease term was changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at time of lease inception operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid we made the policy election to combine lease and nonlease components we also consider fixed common area maintenance “cam” part of our fixed future lease payments fixed cam is also included in our operating lease liability operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments initial direct costs lease incentives and impairment of operating lease assets to determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid we estimate incremental borrowing rates corresponding to the reasonably certain lease term as we have no outstanding debt nor committed credit facilities secured or otherwise we estimate this rate based on prevailing financial market conditions comparable company and credit analysis and management judgment if the estimate of our incremental borrowing rate was changed our operating lease assets and liabilities could differ materially 

chipotle rewards 

eligible customers who enroll in the chipotle rewards loyalty program generally earn points for every dollar spent after accumulating the required number of points the customer may select a reward earned rewards generally expire one to two months after they are issued and points generally expire if an account is inactive for a period of six months 

the estimation of the standalone selling price of points and other rewards issued to customers involves several assumptions primarily the estimated value of product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed and the probability that the points or reward will expire our estimate of points and other rewards we expect to be redeemed is based on historical company specific data these inputs are subject to change over time due to factors such as menu price increases changes in point redemption options and changes in customer behavior increasing our estimated ultimate redemption rate for estimated future redemptions by 100 basis points would have resulted in a reduction of food and beverage revenue on our consolidated statement of income of approximately 04 million for the year ended december 31 2021 

gift cards 

we sell gift cards which do not have expiration dates and we do not deduct nonusage fees from outstanding gift card balances gift card balances are initially recorded as unearned revenue we recognize revenue from gift cards when the gift card is redeemed by the customer historically the majority of gift cards are redeemed within one year in addition a portion of gift cards are not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as breakage over time in proportion to gift card redemptions “gift card breakage rate”  the gift card breakage rate is based on company and program specific information including historical redemption patterns and expected remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws if applicable   we evaluate our gift card breakage rate estimate annually or more frequently as circumstances warrant and apply that rate to gift card redemptions decreasing our gift card breakage rate by 50 basis points would have resulted in a reduction of food and beverage revenue on our consolidated statement of income of approximately 51 million for the year ended december 31 2021 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets to be held and used for potential impairment assets are grouped together at the market level or in the case of a potential relocation or closure at the restaurant level we manage our restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities as such an individual restaurant’s cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market 

  

  

the fair value measurement for asset impairment is based on level 3 inputs we first compare the carrying value of the asset or asset group referred interchangeably throughout as asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value the estimated fair value of the asset is generally determined using the income approach to measure the fair value which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows key inputs to the income approach for restaurant assets include the discount rate projected revenue and expenses and sublease income if we are closing the restaurant in certain cases management uses other market information when available to estimate the fair value of an asset the impairment charges represent the excess of each asset’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value and are allocated among the longlived asset or assets of the group 

our estimates of future revenues and expenses are highly subjective judgments based on internal projections and knowledge of our operations historical performance and trends in sales and restaurant operating costs and can be significantly impacted by changes in our business or economic conditions the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment and utilizes valuation techniques including discounting estimated future cash flows and marketbased analyses to determine fair value if our estimates or underlying assumptions including discount rate and sublease income change in the future our operating results may be materially impacted 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the requisite service period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights “sosars” and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards is based in part on the estimated probability of achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions including but not limited to growth in comparable restaurant sales and average restaurant level margin and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or if we changed our assumptions regarding the probability of achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations may be materially different as a result of changing our assumptions for the estimated payout of our various performance base awards during the year ended december 31 2021 relative to these estimated payouts as of december 31 2020 we incurred an additional 211 million of stockbased compensation expense during the year ended december 31 2021 

insurance liability 

we are selfinsured for a significant portion of our employee health benefits programs we carry significant retentions for risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers’ compensation general liability property and auto damage employment practices liability cyber liability and directors’ and officers’ liability predetermined loss limits have been arranged with thirdparty insurance companies to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business we record an accrual for legal contingencies when we determine that it is probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows 

  

  

income taxes 

our benefitprovision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance requires the use of estimates based on our management’s interpretation and application of complex tax laws and accounting guidance we are primarily subject to income taxes in the united states we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the measurement and recognition of the item we may adjust these reserves when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available and will be reflected in the period in which the new information is available or due to the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations while we believe that our reserves are adequate issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related reserve and could materially increase or decrease our income tax provision in future periods ‎ 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

commodity price risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials and utilities to run our restaurants are ingredients or commodities that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices and range forward protocols under which we agree on a price range for the duration of that protocol generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 24 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in some cases we have minimum purchase obligations we have tried to increase where practical the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance we also could experience shortages of key ingredients if our suppliers need to close or restrict operations due to the impact of the covid19 outbreak or due to industrywide shipping and freight delays 

changing interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments as of december 31 2021 we had 14 billion in cash and cash equivalents current and longterm investments and restricted cash nearly all of which are interest bearing changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date

business strategy 

we are a brand with a demonstrated purpose of cultivating a better world our mission is to win today while creating a bright future by focusing on five key fundamental strategies 

 making the brand more visible and loved 

 utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation 

 leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access convenience and engagement 

 engaging with customers through our loyalty program and 

 running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional inrestaurant and digital experiences 

food with integrity 

serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to ensuring guests enjoy wholesome food at a great value in all of our chipotle restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that are raised in accordance with criteria we have established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare and without the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones we brand these meats as “responsibly raised®” one of our primary goals is for all of chipotle restaurants to serve meats raised to our standards but we have and expect to continue to face challenges in doing so for example some of our restaurants periodically serve conventionally raised chicken or beef due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised brand meats or stop 

  

  

serving one or more menu items due to additional supply constraints when we become aware of such an issue we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that guests can adjust their orders if they choose to do so we also seek to use responsibly grown produce by which we mean produce grown by suppliers whose practices conform to our priorities with respect to environmental considerations and employee welfare some of the beans we serve are organically grown or grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown we call these beans “transitional” some of the other produce items we serve are organically grown as well as we continue our commitment to find high quality ingredients 

purchasing 

maintaining the high levels of quality and safety we demand in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our 24 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality price availability and the suppliers’ understanding and adherence of our mission we’ve also sought to increase where practical the number of suppliers for our ingredients to help mitigate pricing volatility and reduce our reliance on one or several suppliers which could create supply shortages in addition we closely monitor industry news trade tariffs weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients  certain cuts of beef tomatoes tortillas and adobo  are purchased from a small number of suppliers 

quality assurance and food safety 

we are committed to serving only safe high quality food our food safety and quality assurance teams work to ensure compliance with our food safety programs and practices components of which include 

 supplier interventions steps to mitigate food safety risks before ingredients reach chipotle 

 advanced technologies tools that reduce or eliminate pathogens while maintaining food quality 

 small grower support and training 

 enhanced restaurant procedures protocols for handling ingredients and sanitizing surfaces in our restaurants 

 food safety certifications 

 internal and thirdparty restaurant inspections and 

 ingredient traceability 

these and other food safety practices underscore our commitment to be a leader in food safety while continuing to serve high quality food that our guests love our food safety and quality assurance teams establish and monitor our quality and food safety programs and work closely with suppliers to ensure our high standards are met throughout the supply chain we maintain a limited list of approved suppliers  many of whom are among the top suppliers in the industry in addition we have a team approach where our training operations culinary legal and safety security and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality food preparation restaurant cleanliness employee health protocols and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also intended to ensure that we not only continue to comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations but also establish chipotle as an industry leader in food safety to help achieve this goal we have a food safety advisory council comprised of some of the nation’s foremost food safety authorities the food safety advisory council is charged with evaluating our programs both in practice and implementation and advising us on ways to elevate our already high standards for food safety our food safety and quality assurance team members hold board seats and participate in technical working groups with several associations this gives us the opportunity to learn and share our knowledge and expertise with other food safety professionals and regulatory agencies 

digital business 

our digital platform continues to be a strategic driver of our growth in the past year we significantly upgraded our capabilities by digitizing almost all of our restaurant digitalmake lines expanding our partnerships with thirdparty delivery services and building more chipotlanes which is our drive through format for customer pickup of digital orders digital sales which includes delivery and customer pickup accounted for 462 of our total sales in 2020 compared to 109 of total sales in 2019 our strong digital platform gave us a competitive advantage during the covid19 pandemic as more guests prefer to eat their meals at home and inrestaurant dining was prohibited or restricted we have made digital ordering convenient with enhancements to the chipotle app and website such as unlimited customization contactless delivery and group ordering

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including the management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes if any of the risks and uncertainties described below actually occur or continue to occur our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies including but not limited to overall economic and industry conditions and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may arise or become material and may negatively impact our business reputation financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to the nature of our restaurant business and operating in the restaurant industry 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business by decreasing sales and increasing costs 

food safety is our top priority and we dedicate appropriate resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe highquality food products even with strong preventative controls and interventions foodborne illnesses continue to occur in the restaurant industry because food safety risks cannot be completely eliminated in any restaurant incidents may result from the failure of restaurant crew members or suppliers to follow our food safety policies and procedures or from employees or guests entering our restaurant while ill and contaminating food ingredients or surfaces although we monitor and audit all of our programs we cannot guarantee that each and every individual food item is safely and properly maintained during distribution throughout the supply chain regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illness such as e coli hepatitis a norovirus or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect our reputation and have a negative impact on our sales in addition instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination that occur solely at competitors’ restaurants could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry and adversely impact our sales social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity including actual or perceived food safety incidents can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to investigate respond and address an issue the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

we may be more susceptible than our competitors to significant adverse consequences arising from food safety incidents due to several highly publicized food safety events in our restaurants and failure to adhere to our food safety standards from 2015 to 2017 illnesses caused by e coli bacteria and norovirus were connected to a number of our restaurants and in 2018 illnesses believed to be caused by c perfringens bacteria were connected to the food in one of our restaurants as a result of these incidents and the related negative publicity our sales and profitability were severely impacted throughout 2016 and from time to time through 2018 because of consumer perceptions in the wake of these food safety incidents any future food safety incidents associated with our restaurants—even incidents that would be considered minor at other restaurants— may have a more significant negative impact on our sales and our ability to regain guests in addition we may be at a higher risk for food safety incidents than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh unprocessed produce handling of raw chicken our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation and our avoidance of frozen ingredients the risk of illnesses associated with our food also may increase due to the growth of our delivery or catering businesses in which our food is transported andor served in transportation conditions that are not under our control all of these factors could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain guests which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 

the restaurant industry is highly competitive if we are not able to compete successfully our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to taste preferences price food quality and selection customer service brand reputation digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives and the location attractiveness and maintenance of restaurants we also compete with a number of nontraditional market participants such as convenience stores grocery stores coffee shops meal kit delivery services and “ghost” or dark kitchens where meals are prepared at separate takeaway premises rather than a restaurant competition from food delivery services has also increased in recent years particularly during covid19 and is expected to continue to increase increased competition could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability and development plans if consumer or dietary preferences change if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other restaurant outlets our business could be adversely affected 

we continue to believe that our commitment to higherquality and responsibly sourced ingredients gives us a competitive advantage however more competitors have made claims related to the quality of their ingredients and lack of artificial flavors colors and preservatives the increasing use of these claims by competitors regardless of the accuracy of such claims may lessen our differentiation and make it more difficult for us to compete if we are unable to continue to maintain our distinctiveness and compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

  

our digital business which accounted for almost half of revenues in 2020 is subject to risks 

in 2020 462 of our revenue was derived from digital orders which includes delivery and customer pickup compared to 18 of our revenues in 2019 the growth in digital orders is attributable to more guests dining at home due to covid19 our expanded partnerships with multiple thirdparty delivery services and our expansion of chipotlanes which is our drive through format for digital order pickups depending on which ordering platform a digital order is placed  our platform or the platform of a thirdparty delivery service – the delivery fee we collect from the guest may be less than the actual delivery cost which has a negative impact on our profitability in the fall of 2020 we implemented a menu price increase to partially offset higher delivery costs however our higher menu prices may cause some guests to shift their purchases to other restaurants offered on the platform as our digital business grows we are increasingly reliant on thirdparty delivery companies which maintain control over data regarding guests that use their platform and over the customer experience if a thirdparty delivery company driver fails to make timely deliveries or fails to deliver the complete order our guests may attribute the bad customer experience to chipotle and could stop ordering from us the ordering and payment platforms used by these thirdparties or our mobile app or online ordering system could be interrupted by technological failures user errors cyberattacks or other factors which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our overall sales and reputation the thirdparty delivery business is intensely competitive with a number of players competing for market share online traffic capital and delivery drivers if the thirdparty delivery companies we utilize cease or curtail operations increase their fees or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted the delivery business has been consolidating and may continue to consolidate and fewer thirdparty delivery companies may give them more leverage in negotiating the terms and pricing of contracts which could negatively impact our profits from delivery orders 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

social media and internetbased communications including videosharing social networking and messaging platforms give users immediate access to a broad audience these platforms have dramatically increased the speed of dissemination and accessibility of information including negative publicity related to food safety incidents and negative guest and employee experiences accurate and inaccurate or misleading information can be widely disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond or address an issue as a result of our highly publicized food safety incidents in 2015  2018 negative social media posts about our business may generate a disproportionately negative response than would be the results at other companies without a similar history it is impossible to for us to fully predict or control social media backlash to potential issues which could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy 

use of social media platforms is an important element of our marketing efforts and became increasingly more important during the covid19 pandemic new social media platforms are developing rapidly and we need to continuously innovate and evolve our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives to reach our guests and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to us including our national loyalty program called chipotle rewards these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information the inappropriate use of social media by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

if w e do not continue to persuade consumers of the benefits of paying higher prices for our higher quality food our sales and results of operations could be hurt  

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade consumers that food made with ingredients that were raised or grown in accordance with our food with integrity principles is worth paying a higher price at our restaurants relative to prices of some of our competitors particularly quickservice restaurant competitors under our food with integrity principles for example animals must be responsibly raised and the milk in our sour cream cheese and queso must come from cows that have not been treated with rbgh which practices typically are more costly than conventional farming if we are not able to successfully persuade consumers that consuming food made consistent with our food with integrity principles is better for them and the environment or if consumers are not willing to pay the prices we charge our sales could be adversely affected which would negatively impact our results of operations 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results operations and outlook for an extended period of time 

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic and restrictions imposed by federal state and local governments in response to the outbreak have disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business during 2020 individuals in many areas where we operate our 

  

  

restaurants were required to practice social distancing restricted from gathering in groups andor mandated to “stay home” except for “essential” purposes in response to the covid19 outbreak and government restrictions we were required to close some of our restaurants close many of our dining rooms and offer only takeout and delivery andor implement modified work hours the mobility restrictions fear of contracting the coronavirus and the sharp increase in unemployment caused by the closure of businesses in response to the covid19 outbreak have adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our guest traffic which in turn adversely impacts our liquidity financial condition or results of operations even as and when the mobility restrictions are loosened or lifted guests may still be reluctant to return to inrestaurant dining and the impact of lost wages due to covid19 related unemployment may dampen consumer spending for the foreseeable future 

our restaurant operations have been and could continue to be disrupted by employees who are unable or unwilling to work whether because of illness quarantine fear of contracting covid19 or caring for family members due to covid19 disruptions or illness restaurant closures limited service options or modified hours of operation due to staffing shortages could materially adversely affect our liquidity financial condition or results of operations to protect the health and safety of our employees and guests we provide face coverings for all restaurant employees offer enhanced health and welfare benefits provided temporary wage increases during the initial onset of the pandemic provide 14 days of paid emergency leave for covidrelated concerns paid discretionary bonuses to restaurant employees purchased additional sanitation supplies and personal protective materials implemented a tamper evident packaging seal for all digital orders and created a new steward role to sanitize hightraffic restaurant areas these measures have increased our operating costs and adversely affected our liquidity 

the covid19 outbreak also has affected and may continue to adversely affect the ability of certain of our suppliers to fulfill their obligations to us which may negatively affect our restaurant operations these suppliers include third parties that supply andor prepare our ingredients packaging paper and cleaning products and other necessary operating materials distribution centers and logistics and transportation services providers if our suppliers are unable to fulfill their obligations to us we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted 

we also modified our plans for opening new restaurants and remodeling existing restaurants due to the covid19 outbreak to preserve liquidity we delayed new restaurant construction and restaurant remodels that were scheduled to begin during the first half of the year and we limited restaurant remodels to restaurants that do not have a digital make line or chipotlane these changes may materially adversely affect our ability to grow our business particularly if these construction projects are delayed for a significant amount of time 

we cannot predict how long the covid19 outbreak will last or if it will reoccur even after the vaccines are widely administered when government restrictions and mandates will be imposed or lifted or how quickly if at all guests will return to their precovid19 purchasing behaviors so we cannot predict how long our results of operations and financial performance will be adversely impacted 

risks related to labor and supply chain 

increase in ingredient and other operating costs including those caused by climate andor other sustainability risks could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs including ingredients paper supplies fuel utilities and distribution and other operating costs including leasing costs and labor any volatility in key commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability the markets for some of the ingredients we use such as beef avocado and chicken are particularly volatile due to factors such as limited sources seasonal shifts climate conditions industry demand including as a result of animal disease outbreaks in other parts of the world international commodity markets food safety concerns product recalls and government regulation increasing weather volatility or other longterm changes in global weather patterns including related to global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients these factors are beyond our control and in many instances unpredictable volatility in prices or disruptions in supply also may result from governmental actions such as changes in traderelated tariffs or controls sanctions and counter sanctions governmentmandated closure of our suppliers’ operations and asset seizures the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries whether or not they have merit or the impact of these other measures may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm 

in addition our supply chain is subject to increased costs arising from the effects of climate change greenhouse gases and diminishing energy and water resources the ongoing and longterm costs of these impacts related to climate change and other sustainability related issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if not properly mitigated 

we also could be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and animal welfare criteria and ingredients grown in accordance with our food with integrity specifications the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for conventionally raised or grown ingredients any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef dairy for cheese and sour cream avocados beans rice tomatoes and 

  

  

pork would have a particularly adverse effect on our operating results if the cost of one or more ingredients significantly increases we may choose to temporarily suspend serving the menu items that use those ingredients such as guacamole or one of our proteins rather than pay the increased cost any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and could adversely impact our sales and brand we can only partially address future price risk through forward contracts careful planning and other activities and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients could adversely affect our operating results 

our business is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of ingredients that comply with our food with integrity specifications we may experience shortages delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants due to inclement weather natural disasters labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers distributors or transportation providers or other conditions beyond our control in addition we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients including certain cuts of beef tomatoes tortillas and adobo although we believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of ingredients shortages or interruptions in our supply of ingredients could adversely affect our financial results 

if we fail to comply with various applicable federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

various federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees and similar laws and regulations apply to our operations outside of the us these laws and regulations relate to matters such as employment discrimination wage and hour laws predictive scheduling “fair workweek” and “just cause” termination laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules healthcare laws and antidiscrimination and antiharassment laws complying with these laws and regulations subjects us to substantial expense and noncompliance could expose us to significant liabilities for example previously a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee classification employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we incur legal costs to defend and we could suffer losses from these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant in addition several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases changes to eligibility for overtime pay paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements these changes have increased our labor costs and may have a further negative impact on our labor costs in the future 

in addition several jurisdictions including new york city philadelphia chicago seattle oregon san francisco and san jose have implemented fair workweek legislation which impose complex requirements related to scheduling for certain restaurant and retail employees other jurisdictions where we operate are considering enacting similar legislation several jurisdictions also have implemented sick paypaid time off legislation which requires employers to provide paid time off to employees and “just cause” termination legislation which restricts companies’ ability to terminate employees unless they can prove “just cause” or a “bona fide economic reason” for the termination all of these regulations impose additional obligations on us and could increase our costs of doing business our failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could lead to higher employee turnover and negative publicity and subject us to penalties and other legal liabilities which could adversely affect our business and results of operations and potentially cause us to close some restaurants in these jurisdictions 

in addition a significant number of our restaurant crew are paid at rates impacted by the applicable minimum wage to the extent implemented federal state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters could to the extent implemented materially increase our labor and other costs several states in which we operate have approved minimum wage increases that are above the federal minimum as more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases we expect our labor costs will continue to increase our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices depends on willingness of our guests to pay the higher prices and our perceived value relative to competitors our distributors and suppliers could also be affected by higher minimum wage benefit standards and compliance costs which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us 

additionally while our employees are not currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize our employees and those of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to become covered by collective bargaining agreements our labor costs could increase and it could negatively impact our culture and reduce our flexibility to attract and retain top performing employees labor unions have attempted and likely will continue to attempt to attract media attention to their organizing efforts in our restaurants and their organizing efforts include claims that chipotle mistreats or undervalues its employees despite our efforts to provide more accurate information about our policies and practices these messages may dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants 

  

  

if we are not able to hire train reward and retain qualified restaurant crew andor if we are not able to appropriately plan our workforce our growth plan and profitability could be adversely affected 

we rely on our restaurantlevel employees to consistently provide highquality food and positive experiences to our guests in addition our ability to continue to open new restaurants depends on our ability to recruit train and retain highquality crew members to manage and work in our restaurants maintaining appropriate staffing in our existing restaurants and hiring and training staff for our new restaurants requires precise workforce planning which has become more complex due to predictive scheduling “fair workweek” laws and “just cause” termination legislation if we fail to appropriately plan our workforce it could adversely impact guest satisfaction operational efficiency and restaurant profitability in addition if we fail to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction it could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization efforts the covid19 pandemic has exacerbated staffing complexities for us and other restaurant operators and during 2020 we were forced to temporarily close some restaurants or limit operating hours due to employee illnesses fear of contracting covid or caregiving responsibilities among our restaurant crew covid19 has also resulted in aggressive competition for talent wage inflation and pressure to improve benefits and workplace conditions to remain competitive our failure to recruit and retain new restaurant crew members in a timely manner or higher employee turnover levels all could affect our ability to open new restaurants and grow sales at existing restaurants and we may experience higher than projected labor costs 

risks related to it systems cybersecurity and data privacy 

cybersecurity breaches or other privacy or data security incidents could result in unauthorized access theft modification or destruction of confidential guest personal employee and other material confidential information that is stored in our systems or by third parties on our behalf which may adversely affect our business 

a cyber incident generally refers to any intentional attack or an unintentional event that results in unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal or expose confidential information or intellectual property a cyber incident that compromises the information of our guests or employees could result in widespread negative publicity damage to our reputation a loss of guests disruption of our business and legal liabilities as our reliance on technology has grown the scope and severity of risks posed to our systems from cyber threats has increased in addition as more business activities have shifted online and more people are working remotely including as a result of covid19 we have experienced an increase in cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse malware and other events that could have a security impact however there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective 

the majority of our restaurant sales are made by credit or debit cards and we also maintain personal information regarding our employees and confidential information about our guests and suppliers we segment our card data environment and employ a cyber security protection program that is based on proven industry frameworks this program includes but is not limited to cyber security techniques tactics and procedures including the deployment of a robust set of security controls continuous monitoring and detection programs network protections vendor selection criteria secure software development programs and ongoing employee training awareness and incident response preparedness in addition we continuously scan our environment for any vulnerabilities perform penetration testing engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our security measures and collaborate with members of the cyber security community however there are no assurances that such programs will prevent or detect cyber security breaches 

from time to time we have been and likely will continue to be the target of cyber and other security threats for example some of our guests have experienced account takeover fraud in which guests use the same log in credentials on multiple websites and when a third party fraudulently obtains those credentials they can gain unauthorized access to their accounts and charge food orders to the credit card linked to the account without accessing credit card data we may in the future become subject to other legal proceedings or governmental investigations for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our consumers’ credit or debit card information or if consumer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately any such claim or proceeding or any adverse publicity resulting from such an event may have a material adverse effect on our business and we may incur significant remediation costs 

cybersecurity breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue additionally the california privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which became effective on january 1 2020 provides a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and the right for consumers to request deletion of 

  

  

personal information subject to certain exceptions  if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems or fail to properly respond to consumer requests under the ccpa we could experience reputational damage adverse publicity loss of consumer confidence reduced sales and profits complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk including criminal penalties or civil liabilities 

compliance with the gdpr the ccpa and other current and future applicable international and us privacy cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and timeconsuming we make significant investments in technology thirdparty services and internal personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss in addition media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our thirdparty business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred 

we may incur increased costs to comply with privacy and data protection laws and if we fail to comply we could be subject to government enforcement actions private litigation and adverse publicity 

the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is changing at an everincreasing pace with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business complying with newly developed laws and regulations which are subject to change and uncertain interpretations and may be inconsistent from state to state or country to country may lead to a decline in guest engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs or modifications to our operations or business practices to comply 

we are subject to the european union’s gdpr which requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue additionally in july 2020 the european court of justice’s invalidation of crossborder data transfer mechanisms such as the useu privacy shield and the standard contractual clauses has imposed new uncertainty in privacy compliance and an adverse impact on operational efficiency with our thirdparty vendors 

the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data maintaining our compliance with those requirements may limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a more personalized guest experience the ccpa provides a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices allows consumers to optout of certain data sharing with third parties and gives consumers the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions  if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems or fail to properly respond to consumer requests under the ccpa we could experience regulatory fines reputational damage adverse publicity loss of consumer confidence reduced sales and profits complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk including criminal penalties or civil liabilities 

we rely heavily on information technology systems and failures or interruptions in our it systems could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information technology systems including the pointofsale and payment processing system in our restaurants technologies supporting our online ordering digital and delivery business technologies that traceback ingredients to suppliers and growers and manage our supply chain our rewards program technologies that facilitate marketing initiatives employee engagement and payroll processing and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the procurement production distribution safety and sale of our products depends significantly on the availability reliability and security of these systems many of these critical systems are provided and managed by third parties and we are reliant on these thirdparty providers to implement protective measures that ensure the security and availability of their systems although we have operational safeguards in place these safeguards may not be effective in preventing the failure of these thirdparty systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events physical theft computer and network failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in thirdparty software or services errors or improper use by our employees or the thirdparty service providers if any of our critical it systems were to become unreliable unavailable compromised or otherwise fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner we could experience an interruption in our operations that could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 

  

  

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan at our restaurant support centers following a disaster or force majeure event could have a material adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address crisislevel events including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information and the covid19 pandemic has provided a limited test of our ability to manage our business remotely however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims in addition these threats are constantly evolving which increases the difficulty of accurately and timely predicting planning for and protecting against the threat as a result our disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans security may not adequately address all threats we face or protect us from loss 

legal and regulatory risks 

a violation of chipotle’s deferred prosecution agreement could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in april 2020 chipotle signed a deferred prosecution agreement the “dpa” which was filed in the us district court for the central district of california to settle an official criminal investigation conducted by the us attorney’s office for the central district of california in conjunction with the us food and drug administration’s office of criminal investigations collectively the “doj” into companywide food safety matters that occurred in our restaurants dating back to january 1 2013 pursuant to the dpa the doj filed a twocount class a misdemeanor information in the united states district court for the central district of california charging chipotle with adulterating and causing food to be adulterated within the meaning of the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdca” while such food was held for sale under the dpa chipotle paid a 25 million fine and is required to enhance and maintain a comprehensive compliance program that is designed to ensure chipotle complies with all applicable federal and state food safety laws the doj agreed that if chipotle is in full compliance with all of its obligations under the dpa at the conclusion of the threeyear deferred prosecution term the doj will move to dismiss the twocount information filed against chipotle full compliance with the dpa requires among other things chipotle to conduct a root cause analysis of the historic food safety matters maintain and annually update a comprehensive food safety plan and comply with applicable provisions of the fdca 

chipotle owns and operates over 2700 restaurants and we dedicate substantial resources to our food safety program however even with strong preventative controls and interventions food safety risks cannot be completely eliminated in any restaurant food safety risks may arise due to possible failures by restaurant crew or suppliers to follow food safety policies and procedures employees or guests coming to the restaurant while ill or serving contaminated food ingredients if chipotle is found to have breached the terms of the dpa the doj may elect to prosecute or bring a civil action against the company for conduct alleged in the dpa’s statement of facts which could result in additional fines penalties and have material adverse impacts on our results of operations in addition further action by the doj may significantly and adversely affect our brand and reputation especially in light of our highly publicized food safety incidents in 2015 – 2017 

we could be party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business results of operations and reputation 

we have been and in the future we likely will be subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business these legal proceedings may involve claims brought by employees guests government agencies suppliers shareholders or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these legal proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour employment of minors discrimination wrongful termination and vacation and family leave laws food safety issues including foodborne illness food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of our food products data security or privacy breaches guest discrimination personal injury in our restaurants trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns for example a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state employment laws including wage and hour claims and in 2020 we settled an official criminal investigation by the us attorney’s office for the central district of california in conjunction with the us food and drug administration’s office of criminal investigations related to companywide food safety matters dating back to 2013 we could be involved in similar or even more significant litigation and legal proceedings in the future even if the allegations against us in current or future legal matters are unfounded or we ultimately are not held liable the costs to defend ourselves may be significant and the litigation may subject us to substantial settlements fines penalties or judgments against us and may divert managements attention away from operating our business all of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations litigation also may generate negative publicity regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are liable which could damage our reputation and adversely impact our sales and our relationship with our employees and guests 

  

  

we are subject to extensive laws government regulation and other legal requirements and our failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could adversely affect our operational efficiencies ability to attract and retain talent and results of operations 

our business is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations including those relating to 

 preparation sale and labeling of food including regulations of the food and drug administration which oversees the safety of the entire food system including inspections and mandatory food recalls menu labeling and nutritional content

risks related to our growth and business strategy 

if we are unable to meet our projections for new restaurant openings or efficiently maintain the attractiveness of our existing restaurants our profitability could suffer 

our growth strategy depends on our ability to continue to open new restaurants and operate them profitably historically it can take up to 24 months to ramp up the sales and profitability of a new restaurant during the rampup phase the restaurant’s sales and income are below the levels at which we expect them to normalize and costs may be higher as we train new employees and adjust our food deliveries and preparation to sales trends if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect or overcome the initial higher costs associated with new restaurants our new restaurants may not be as profitable as our existing restaurants our ability to open and profitably operate new restaurants also is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease terms the ability to operate with a chipotlane the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses and to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of capable contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage labor activities that could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

in addition in an effort to increase samerestaurant sales and improve our operating performance we continue to improve our existing restaurants through remodels upgrades and regular upkeep if the costs associated with remodels upgrades or regular upkeep are higher than anticipated restaurants are closed for remodeling for longer periods than planned or remodeled restaurants do not perform as expected we may not realize our projected desired return on investment which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

  

  

substantially all of our restaurants operate in leased properties subject to longterm leases if we are unable to secure new leases on favorable terms terminate unfavorable leases or renew or extend favorable leases our profitability may suffer 

we operate substantially all of our restaurants in leased facilities it is becoming increasing challenging to locate and secure favorable lease facilities for new restaurants as competition for restaurant sites in our target markets is intense development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors could negatively impact our ability to manage our occupancy costs which may adversely impact our profitability in addition any of these factors may be exacerbated by economic factors which may result in an increased demand for developers and contractors that could drive up our construction and leasing costs also as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our existing restaurant base will decline making it increasingly difficult to achieve levels of sales and profitability growth that we achieved in prior years 

from time to time we may close or relocate a restaurant if a current location becomes less profitable as a result of adverse economic conditions or local regulatory compliance in the area we also have closed some restaurants where the impact of covid19 was severe if the closures continue for a long period of time we may not be able to recover our investment due to the high rental rates because substantially all of our restaurants operate in leased facilities we may incur significant lease termination expenses when we close or relocate a restaurant and are often obligated to continue rent and other lease related payments after restaurant closure we also may incur significant asset impairment and other charges in connection with closures and relocations if the lease termination cost is significant we may decide to keep underperforming restaurants open ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could decrease our results of operations in addition we may be unable to renew a lease without substantial additional cost at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks that may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

our failure to effectively manage our growth could have a negative adverse effect on our business and financial results 

as of december 31 2020 we owned and operated 2764 chipotle restaurants and we plan to open a significant number of new restaurants in the next several years our existing restaurant management systems back office technology systems and processes financial and management controls information systems and personnel may not be adequate to support our continued growth to effectively manage a larger number of restaurants we may need to upgrade and expand our infrastructure and information systems automate more processes that currently are manual or require manual intervention and hire train and retain restaurant crew and corporate support staff all of which may result in increased costs and at least temporary inefficiencies we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success and as we continue to grow it may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture our failure to sufficiently invest in our infrastructure and information systems and maintain our strong staffing and culture could harm our brand and operating results 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic growth plans and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

our ability to continue to grow our business depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive leadership team and other key management personnel changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support our strategic initiatives or to build adequate bench strength with key skillsets required for seamless succession of leadership could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets if we are unable to attract develop retain and incentivize sufficiently experienced and capable management personnel our business and financial results may suffer 

the market price of our common stock may be more volatile than the market price of our peers 

we believe the market price of our common stock generally has traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most of our peer companies as well as the overall market which typically has reflected market expectations for higher future operating results at any given point in time our priceearnings ratio may trade at more than twice the priceearnings ratio of the sp 500 also the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times including as a result of adverse publicity events as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

general risk factors 

economic and business factors that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and the results of our operations 

restaurant dining generally is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending which may be affected by general economic conditions that are beyond our control for example international domestic and regional economic conditions consumer income levels financial market volatility a slow or stagnant pace of economic growth rising energy costs rising interest rates social unrest and governmental political and budget concerns or divisions may have a negative effect on consumer confidence and discretionary 

  

  

spending in addition a new presidential and legislative administration recently took office and it is not yet known what changes the new administration will make to economic or tax policies and how those policies will impact the economy or consumer discretionary spending any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average transactions would negatively impact our financial performance any actual or perceived threat of a pandemic or communicable disease terrorist attack mass shooting heightened security requirements including cybersecurity or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could harm our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of the above factors or other unfavorable changes in business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or limit our ability to increase pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations these factors also could cause us to among other things reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings close restaurants or delay remodeling of our existing restaurant locations further poor economic conditions may force nearby businesses to shut down which could reduce traffic to our restaurants or cause our restaurant locations to be less attractive 

our quarterly financial results may fluctuate significantly including due to factors that are not in our control 

our quarterly financial results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet investors’ expectations for various reasons including 

 neg ative publicity about the safety of our food employmentrelated issues litigation or other issues involving our restaurants 

 fluctuations in supply costs particularly for our most significant ingredients and our inability to offset the higher cost with price increases without adversely impacting guest traffic 

 labor availability and wages of restaurant management and crew 

 increases in marketing or promotional expenses 

 the timing of new restaurant openings and related revenues and expenses and the operating costs at newly opened restaurants 

 the impact of inclement weather and natural disasters such as freezes and droughts which could decrease guest traffic and increase the costs of ingredients 

 the amount and timing of stockbased compensation 

 litigation settlement costs and related legal expenses 

 tax expenses asset impairment charges and nonoperating costs and 

 variations in general economic conditions including the impact of declining interest rates on our interest income 

as a result of any of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease

overview 

as of december 31 2020 we operated 2724 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states 40 international chipotle restaurants and four nonchipotle restaurants we are committed to making good food more accessible to everyone while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose 

overview of the impact of covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our operations and financial results for the foreseeable future in response to covid19 we temporarily closed some restaurants and dining rooms in our restaurants we continue to follow guidance from health officials in determining the appropriate restrictions to put in place for each restaurant as of december 31 2020 the majority of our restaurants have been reopened for dinein with restrictions such as social distancing and mask requirements for all customers to ensure the health and safety of our guests and employees certain restaurants only offer takeout digital order ahead and delivery services in accordance with local guidance and regulations for a further discussion of the impacts that covid19 has had on our financial results refer to the “results of operations” 

we remain in regular contact with our major suppliers and while to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain we could see future disruptions should the impacts of covid19 extend for a considerable amount of time within our restaurants we have taken a number of steps to enhance our robust food safety protocols including the creation of the steward role which is focused on sanitization in hightouch and hightraffic areas providing masks for all employees and having a tamper evident packaging seal for all digital orders to support our employees we have eliminated nonessential travel implemented work from home for our support centers and significantly expanded employee benefits we remain focused on reducing nonessential controllable costs and judiciously spending on return generating projects to preserve liquidity we suspended our stock buyback program during the first quarter of 2020 if our business continues to improve and the economy continues to stabilize we may begin buying again in the first or second quarter of 2021 

2020 financial highlights 

 tot al revenue increased 71 to 60 billion in 2020 compared to 56 billion in 2019 

 comparable restaurant sales increased 18 

 diluted earnings per share “diluted eps” for 2020 increased to 1252 which included an income tax benefit of 379 offset by a 200 aftertax impact from expenses related to legal corporate restructuring restaurant closure costs and certain other costs a 11 increase from 1238 in 2019 

sales trends average restaurant sales were 2223 million for the year ended december 31 2020 an increase from 2205 million for the year ended december 31 2019 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month food and beverage sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months 

total revenue was 60 billion in 2020 an increase of 71 from 56 billion in 2019 the increase was attributable to new restaurant openings and increased comparable restaurant sales comparable restaurant sales increased 18 for the full year 2020 comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales or transactions for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months 

we continue to invest in improving our digital platforms and have significantly upgraded our capabilities by digitizing almost all of our digitalmake lines expanding our partnerships with multiple thirdparty delivery services and building more chipotlanes which is our drive through format for digital order pickups digital sales which includes delivery and customer pickup increased 1741 year over year and accounted for 462 of 2020 sales compared to 109 of 2019 sales the shift to digital sales accelerated in march 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

  

  

restaurant operating costs  during the year ended december 31 2020 our restaurant operating costs food beverage and packaging labor occupancy and other operating costs were 826 of total revenue an increase from 795 in 2019 the increase was driven primarily by covid19 related impacts including increased delivery expenses assistance and exclusion pay elevated beef prices increased incidence of steak and fewer sales of high margin beverages the increase was partially offset by benefits from menu price increases lower avocado pricing and improved labor efficiency realized from digital enhancements to the restaurants 

restaurant development for the full year 2020 we opened 161 new restaurants which included 100 restaurants with a chipotlane we expect to open approximately 200 new restaurants in 2021 

restaurant activity 

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 



results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of total revenue and periodoverperiod change are discussed in the following section 

revenue 



the significant factors contributing to the total revenue increase in 2020 were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases comparable restaurant sales increased 777 million and revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed 3199 million to the total revenue increase of which 1264 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2020 

food beverage and packaging costs   



food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of total revenue in 2020 primarily due to menu price increases taken in the second half of 2020 favorable avocado pricing and better waste control these benefits were partially offset by fewer sales of high margin beverages covid19 related mix shifts elevated beef pricing due to plant shutdowns in the summer of 2020 and higher dairy pricing 

  

  

labor costs 



labor costs increased as a percentage of total revenue in 2020 primarily due to covid19 related labor costs which included assistance pay for restaurant employees and expansion of our emergency leave benefits to accommodate those directly affected by covid19 our assistance pay program ended on june 7 2020 while the expansion of emergency leave benefits remains in place as of december 31 2020 these covid19 related increases were partially offset by the benefits of menu price increases taken in the second half of 2020 and improved labor efficiency realized from digital enhancements to the restaurants 

occupancy costs   



occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenue remained consistent in 2020 as compared to 2019 covid19 had an immaterial impact on occupancy costs for the year ended december 31 2020 

other operating costs 



other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs delivery expenses bank and credit card processing fees and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs other operating costs increased as a percentage of total revenue in 2020 primarily due to increased delivery expenses caused by the significant increase in delivery sales in 2020 

as a result of covid19 we are adapting our restaurant operations to the changing environment and are reducing nonessential controllable costs sales shifted towards delivery after we temporarily closed our dining rooms to help control the spread of covid19 we reprioritized marketing efforts by offering free delivery several times in 2020 

general and administrative expenses 



general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms in 2020 primarily due to the following a 201 million increase in outside service expense related to company initiatives to support digital and restaurant growth a 158 million increase in wages and benefits primarily due to headcount increase and 38 million increase of lease costs primarily related to our previous corporate headquarters these increases were partially offset by a 107 million decrease in noncash stockbased compensation expense primarily related to performance share awards and a 71 million decrease in travel expense related to our decision to halt nonessential employee travel due to the covid19 pandemic 

  

  

other than the impact on travel expenses and stockbased compensation discussed above covid19 had a minimal impact on general and administrative expenses we will continue to assess additional planned general and administrative investments as we better understand the length and severity of the covid19 impacts 

depreciation and amortization 



depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of total revenue in 2020 due to accelerated depreciation associated with our website mobile app and other technology new restaurant openings and equipment upgrades in the restaurants primarily to support the growth in our digital business this increase was partially offset by sales leverage on a partially fixedcost base 

impairment closure costs and asset disposals 



impairment closure costs and asset disposals increased in dollar terms in 2020 primarily due to impairments of leasehold improvements property and equipment and operating lease assets covid19 had a negative impact on our assumptions for future nearterm restaurant level cash flows which resulted in elevated impairment charges 

benefitprovision for income taxes 



the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 was lower than the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to the federal net operating loss that is estimated for tax year 2020 which we expect to carryback to tax years 20152017 the tax benefit is due to the federal income tax rate differential between the 2020 statutory federal income tax rate of 21 and the 20152017 statutory federal income tax rate of 35 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

see note 15 “quarterly financial data unaudited” for a table presenting data from the consolidated statements of income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2020 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way worldwide health pandemics fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases or promotional activities and other marketing initiatives the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results although on an overall annual basis changes in trading days do not have a significant impact 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of non cash stockbased compensation expense and related tax rate impacts litigation settlement costs and related legal expenses impairment charges and nonoperating costs timing of marketing or promotional expenses the number and timing of new restaurants opened in a quarter and closure of restaurants new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening because of the expenses associated with their opening 

  

  

and operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction initiatives to improve the guest experience in our restaurants working capital and general corporate needs as of december 31 2020 we had a cash and marketable investments balance of 11 billion excluding restricted cash of 278 million we expect to utilize cash flow from operations to continue investments in new restaurant construction remodels primarily for restaurants that do not have a digital make line or chipotlane and technology additionally as of december 31 2020 we had 6000 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under a line of credit facility which expires in may 2021 

as sales fell quickly from the impact of covid19 we proactively implemented several actions to reduce cash outlays and expenses as part of our cash preservation strategy in march 2020 we temporarily suspended our stock buyback program in our restaurants we are working to minimize waste effectively schedule labor hours and reduce nonessential controllable costs we halted all nonessential travel and expenses we believe that cash from operations together with our cash and investment balances will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future assuming no significant declines in comparable restaurant sales we expect that we will generate positive cash flow through the foreseeable future should our business deteriorate due to changing conditions there are other actions we can take to further conserve liquidity 

we have not required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverages and supplies sometime after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

our total capital expenditures for 2020 were 3734 million in 2020 we spent on average about 11 million in development and construction costs per new restaurant or about 10 million net of landlord reimbursements of 01 million in 2021 we expect to incur about 390 million in total capital expenditures we expect approximately 220 million in capital expenditures related to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements for new restaurants to be opened in 2021 we anticipate average development costs will remain higher than the historical average due to a significant portion including chipotlanes we expect approximately 120 million in capital expenditures related to investments in existing restaurants including updated equipment technology remodeling and similar improvements finally we expect a portion of our capital expenditures for the year to be incurred for additional corporate initiatives including building corporate offices upgrading our mobile app and other projects 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 were as follows 



1 see note 10 “leases” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” this includes commitments related to reasonably certain renewal periods 

2 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty the majority of our purchase obligations relate to amounts owed for produce and other ingredients and supplies orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction and planned remodels information technology and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships 

the above table does not include income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments additionally we have excluded our estimated loss contingencies due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of payment see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor rent healthcare costs fuel utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level additionally many of our leases require us to pay property taxes maintenance and utilities all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases if we do raise menu prices in the future general competitive pressures or negative consumer responses may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors 

leases 

we determine if a contract contains a lease at inception our material operating leases consist of restaurant locations and office space our leases generally have remaining terms of 120 years and most include options to extend the leases for additional 5year periods generally the lease term is the minimum of the noncancelable period of the lease or the lease term inclusive of reasonably certain renewal periods up to a term of 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably certain lease term was changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at time of lease inception operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments initial direct costs lease incentives and impairment of operating lease assets to determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid we estimate incremental borrowing rates corresponding to the reasonably certain lease term as we have no outstanding debt nor committed credit facilities secured or otherwise we estimate this rate based on prevailing financial market conditions comparable company and credit analysis and management judgment if the estimate of our incremental borrowing rate was changed our operating lease assets and liabilities could differ materially 

chipotle rewards loyalty program 

eligible customers who enroll in the chipotle rewards loyalty program generally earn points for every dollar spent after accumulating a certain number of points the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for a free entrée earned rewards generally expire one to two months after they are issued and points generally expire if an account is inactive for a period of six months 

the estimation of the standalone selling price of points and other rewards issued to customers involves several assumptions primarily the estimated value of product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed and the probability that the points or reward will expire our estimate of points and other rewards we expect to be redeemed is based on historical company specific data these inputs are subject to change over time due to factors such as menu price increases changes in point redemption options and changes in customer behavior 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets to be held and used for potential impairment assets are grouped together at the market level or in the case of a potential relocation or closure at the restaurant level we manage our restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities as such an individual restaurant’s cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market 

the fair value measurement for asset impairment is based on level 3 inputs we first compare the carrying value of the asset or asset group referred interchangeably throughout as asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated 

  

  

undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value the estimated fair value of the asset is generally determined using the income approach to measure the fair value which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows key inputs to the income approach for restaurant assets include the discount rate projected revenue and expenses and sublease income if we are closing the restaurant in certain cases management uses other market information when available to estimate the fair value of an asset the impairment charges represent the excess of each asset’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value and are allocated among the longlived asset or assets of the group 

our estimates of future revenues and expenses are highly subjective judgments based on internal projections and knowledge of our operations historical performance and trends in sales and restaurant operating costs and can be significantly impacted by changes in our business or economic conditions the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment and utilizes valuation techniques including discounting estimated future cash flows and marketbased analyses to determine fair value if our estimates or underlying assumptions including discount rate and sublease income change in the future our operating results may be materially impacted 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the requisite service period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights “sosars” and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards is based in part on the estimated probability of achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions including but not limited to growth in comparable restaurant sales and average restaurant level margin and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or if we changed our assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations may be materially different 

insurance liability 

we are selfinsured for a significant portion of our employee health benefits programs and carry significant retentions for risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers’ compensation general liability property and auto damage employment practices liability cyber liability and directors and officer’s liability predetermined loss limits have been arranged with thirdparty insurance companies to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business we record an accrual for legal contingencies when we determine that it is probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows

our benefitprovision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities including valuation allowance requires the use of estimates based on our management’s interpretation and application of complex tax laws and accounting guidance we are primarily subject to income taxes in the united states we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions for material known tax exposures in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the measurement and recognition of the item we may adjust these reserves when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available and will be reflected in the period in which the new information is available while we believe that our reserves are adequate issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related reserve and could materially increase or decrease our income tax provision in future periods ‎ 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

commodity price risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials and utilities to run our restaurants are ingredients or commodities that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices and range forward protocols under which we agree on a price range for the duration of that protocol generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 36 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in some cases we have minimum purchase obligations we have tried to increase where practical the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance we also could experience shortages of key ingredients if our suppliers need to close or restrict operations due to the impact of the covid19 outbreak 

changing interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2020 we had 10 billion in investments and interestbearing cash accounts including insurancerelated restricted trust accounts classified in restricted cash and 597 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest and other income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 020 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date

 item 1 business 

general 

chipotle mexican grill inc a delaware corporation together with its subsidiaries “chipotle” “we” “us” or “our” operates chipotle mexican grill restaurants which feature a relevant menu of burritos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla tacos and salads we are cultivating a better world by serving responsibly sourced classically cooked real food with wholesome ingredients without artificial colors flavors or preservatives we are passionate about providing a great guest experience and making our food more accessible to everyone while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose steve ells founder and executive chairman first opened chipotle with a single restaurant in denver colorado in 1993 over 25 years later our devotion to seeking out the very best ingredients raised with respect for animals farmers and the environment remains at the core of our commitment to food with integrity as of december 31 2019 we operated 2580 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states 39 international chipotle restaurants and three nonchipotle restaurants 

business strategy 

we are a brand with a demonstrated purpose of cultivating a better world our mission is to win today while creating a bright future by focusing on five key fundamental strategies 

 making the brand more visible and loved 

 creating innovation utilizing a stagegate process 

 leveraging our digitalmake line to expand access and convenience 

 engaging with customers through our loyalty program 

 and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food hospitality throughput and economics 

relevant menu our restaurants feature a relevant menu of burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads in preparing our food we employ classic cooking methods and use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice our restaurants do not have microwaves or freezers our proteins include chicken steak carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy braised and shredded beef sofritas organic braised tofu and vegetarian pinto and black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice freshly chopped cilantro and a pinch of salt as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce and sautéed peppers and onions to our entrees depending on each guest’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also serve tortilla chips that are fried twice a day in each restaurant and seasoned with fresh lime juice and salt with sides of hand mashed guacamole salsas or queso in addition to sodas fruit and tea drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a 

  

  

selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch some in our restaurants and some with the same fresh ingredients in larger batches in commissaries 

food with integrity serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to ensuring guests enjoy wholesome food at a great value we respect our environment and insist on preparing cooking and serving nutritious food made from natural ingredients and animals that are raised or grown with care we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised we concentrate on the sourcing of each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve the food we serve our food is made from ingredients that everyone can both recognize and pronounce were all about simple fresh food without the use of artificial colors or flavors typically found in fast food—just genuine real ingredients and their individual delectable flavors 

in all of our chipotle restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that are raised in accordance with criteria we have established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare and without the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones we brand these meats as “responsibly raised ® ” one of our primary goals is for all of chipotle restaurants to serve meats raised to our standards but we have and expect to continue to face challenges in doing so for example some of our restaurants periodically serve conventionally raised chicken or beef due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised brand meats or stop serving one or more menu items due to additional supply constraints when we become aware of such an issue we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that guests can adjust their orders if they choose to do so 

we also seek to use responsibly grown produce by which we mean produce grown by suppliers whose practices conform to our priorities with respect to environmental considerations and employee welfare some of the beans we serve are organically grown or grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown we call these beans “transitional” some of the other produce items we serve are organically grown as well in 2019 we increased the percentage of organic cilantro rice and beans purchased as we continue our commitment to find high quality ingredients 

purchasing and food safety 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality and safety we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our 23 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and the suppliers’ understanding and adherence of our mission we work closely with our suppliers and seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we use a mix of forward fixed formula and range forward pricing protocols and our distribution centers purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with suppliers we’ve also sought to increase where practical the number of suppliers for our ingredients to help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages in addition we closely monitor industry news trade tariffs weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas are purchased from a small number of suppliers 

quality assurance and food safety we are committed to serving safe high quality food our food safety and quality assurance teams work to ensure compliance with our food safety programs and practices components of which include 

 supplier interventions steps to avoid food safety risks before ingredients reach chipotle 

 advanced technologies tools that reduce or eliminate pathogens while maintaining food quality 

 small grower support and training 

 enhanced restaurant procedures protocols for handling ingredients and sanitizing surfaces in our restaurants 

 food safety certifications 

 internal and thirdparty restaurant inspections and 

 ingredient traceability 

  

  

these and other food safety practices underscore our commitment to be a leader in food safety while continuing to serve high quality food that our guests love our food safety and quality assurance teams establish and monitor our quality and food safety programs and work closely with suppliers to ensure our high standards are met throughout the supply chain we maintain a limited list of approved suppliers many of whom are among the top suppliers in the industry in addition we have a team approach where our training operations culinary legal and safety security and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness employee health protocols and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also intended to ensure that we not only continue to comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations but also establish chipotle as an industry leader in food safety to help achieve this goal we have a food safety advisory council comprised of some of the nation’s foremost food safety authorities the food safety advisory council is charged with evaluating our programs both in practice and implementation and advising us on ways to elevate our already high standards for food safety our food safety and quality assurance team members hold board seats and participate in technical working groups with several associations this gives us the opportunity to learn and share our knowledge and expertise with other food safety professionals and regulatory agencies 

guest experience and operations 

serving delicious food with great service in a safe quick clean and happy environment is always our highest priority and we take pride in making the chipotle experience exceptional we invest in training to consistently deliver an outstanding guest experience and in our facilities to improve the appearance of our restaurants and modernize tools we are also focused on making progress in throughput and getting our guests quality food quickly 

restaurant team we believe creating an excellent guest experience starts with hiring great leaders and creating great teams each restaurant typically has a general manager or restaurateur a highperforming general manager an apprentice manager in a majority of our restaurants two or three service managers one or two kitchen managers and an average of 26 full and parttime crew members though our busier restaurants tend to have slightly more employees we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees in addition to the employees serving our guests at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes field leaders and team directors as well as executive team directors who report to our chief restaurant officer 

innovation  we are prioritizing the development of technological and other innovations such as digitalmobile ordering platforms digital order pickup lanes we call “chipotlanes” delivery and catering that allow our guests to engage with us in whatever fashion is most convenient for them by allowing our guests to order and receive their food in a variety of ways we believe we can attract more guests and encourage them to choose us more frequently during 2019 we completed the installation of mobile order pickup shelves as well as digital make lines in almost all of our restaurants which allows us to fulfill catering or digitalmobile orders without disrupting throughput on our main service line additionally we have enhanced our data capabilities to allow us to better identify individual guests and their unique frequency patterns and to target our marketing and promotional efforts at the individual level we are also testing new menu items we have built a stagegate process around innovation where we test learn and iterate so that when we roll out a new initiative we are highly confident in the probability of success 

marketing 

our marketing programs are designed to increase transactions and grow sales by driving culture driving a difference and ultimately driving purchases our ultimate marketing mission is to make chipotle not just a food brand but also a purpose driven lifestyle brand that is more visible more engaging and more relevant 

in 2019 we made our brand more visible with culturally relevant marketing campaigns and initiatives this included the behind the foil advertising campaign which showcased our real ingredients fresh food and the culinary skills of our team members in action we also launched a new loyalty program chipotle rewards that currently has more than 8 million members and provides us with customer information that can be used to incent behaviors and engage with our customers on a more personal level 

our marketing efforts this year were elevated by our stagegate innovation process that identifies and validates new initiatives and menu items in test markets before they are rolled out more widely we rolled out several successful menu items including our digital only lifestyle bowls which help our guests reach or maintain their health and wellness goals and carne asada a premium seasoned steak 

we utilize multiple marketing channels including national television digital marketing social media fundraising events and sponsorships to make our brand more visible we have invested and will continue to invest in extensive customer research that will give us insight into our consumers in order to inform our business decisions media messaging and innovation pipeline 

  

  

competition 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location convenience brand reputation cleanliness and ambience of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locallyowned restaurants as well as national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout online catering and delivery services among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally in recent years competition has increased significantly from restaurant formats like ours that serve higher quality food quickly and at a reasonable price  

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who seek higherquality food as well as from convenience stores cafeterias and other dining outlets meal kit delivery companies and other eatathome options also present some degree of competition for our restaurants 

competition has made it more challenging to maintain or increase the frequency of customer visits however we believe that we can differentiate ourselves with our fresh ingredients and our purpose of cultivating a better world 

restaurant site selection 

we believe restaurant site selection is critical to our longterm success and growth strategy as a result we devote substantial time and effort to carefully evaluate each potential new restaurant location our site selection process is led by our internal team of real estate managers and includes external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets as well as support from an internal real estate strategy and research group we thoroughly assess the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and available information on competitors and other restaurants based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment for each potential restaurant site we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as in line or endcap locations in strip or power centers in regional malls and downtown business districts freestanding buildings food courts outlet centers airports military bases and train stations 

other restaurant concepts 

although in 2020 our focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based – sourcing better ingredients preparing them using classic techniques in front of our guests and serving them in an interactive format with great teams dedicated to providing an excellent dining experience – can be adapted to cuisines other than the food served at chipotle we have invested in innovative concepts such as pizzeria locale a fastcasual pizza restaurant that has three restaurants in denver colorado 

information systems and cyber security 

we use a variety of applications and systems to securely manage the flow of information within each of our restaurants and centralized corporate infrastructure the services available within our systems and applications include restaurant operations supply chain inventory scheduling training human capital management financial tools and data protection services our digital ordering system allows guests to place orders online or through our mobile app and enables delivery by thirdparty services with which we have entered into delivery agreements we also continue to modernize and make investments in our information technology networks and infrastructure specifically in our physical and technological security measures to anticipate cyberattacks in order to combat breaches as well as provide improved control security and scalability

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including the management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes if any of the risks and uncertainties described below actually occur or continue to occur our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies including but not limited to overall economic and industry conditions and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may arise or become material and may negatively impact our business reputation financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to our business and industry 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business by decreasing sales and increasing costs 

food safety is our top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe highquality food products even with strong preventative controls and interventions food safety incidents continue to occur in the food service industry because food safety risks cannot be completely eliminated in any restaurant including as a result of possible failures by restaurant crew or suppliers to follow food safety policies and procedures although we test and audit these activities we cannot guarantee that all food items are safely and properly maintained during transport or distribution throughout the supply chain regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a norovirus or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect our reputation and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination that occur solely at competitors’ restaurants could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity including as it relates to food safety incidents can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond or address an issue the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

sev er al highly publicized food safety incidents in our restaurants and our food with integrity business principles may make us more susceptible than our competitors to significant adverse consequences arising from food safety incidents from 2015 to 2017 illnesses caused by e coli bacteria and norovirus were connected to a number of our restaurants and in 2018 illnesses believed to be caused by c perfringens bacteria were connected to the food in one of our restaurants as a result of these incidents and the related negative publicity our sales and profitability were severely impacted throughout 2016 and from time to time through 2018 because of consumer perceptions in the wake of these food safety incidents any future food safety incidents associated with our restaurants—even incidents that may be considered minor at other restaurants—may have a more significant negative impact on our sales and our ability to regain guests in addition we may be at a higher risk for food safety incidents than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh unprocessed produce and meats our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation and our avoidance of frozen ingredients the risk of illnesses associated with our food also may increase due to the growth of our delivery or catering businesses in which our food is transported andor served in transportation conditions that we cannot control all of these factors could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain guests which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 

information technology system failures or interruptions could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information technology systems including the pointofsale and payment processing system in our restaurants technologies supporting our digital and delivery businesses technologies that facilitate ecommerce marketing programs employee engagement and payroll processing management of our supply chain and various other processes and transactions o ur ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the procurement production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the availability reliability security and capacity of these systems despite the implementation of protective measures these technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage disability or failures due to theft fire power loss telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events we also are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system which will significantly impact our financial reporting control environment if we fail to successfully implement the new system and effectively train our employees and update our processes we could experience disruptions or delays in processing financial and business information our increasing reliance on systems operated by third parties including delivery aggregators and payment processors also present the risks faced by the thirdparty’s business including the operational security and credit risks of those parties if those systems were to become unreliable unavailable compromised or otherwise fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner we could experience an interruption in our operations that could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 

  

  

cyber security breaches or other privacy or data security incidents that expose confidential guest personal employee and other material confidential information may adversely affect our business 

a cyber incident generally refers to any intentional attack or an unintentional event that results in unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal or expose confidential information or intellectual property a cyber incident that compromises the information of our guests or employees could result in widespread negative publicity damage to our reputation a loss of guests disruption of our business and legal liabilities in recent years as our reliance on technology has increased so have the scope and severity of risks posed to our systems from cyber threats the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse malware and other events that could have a security impact however there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective 

the majority of our restaurant sales are made by credit or debit cards we also maintain certain personal information regarding our employees and confidential information about our guests and suppliers we segment our card data environment and employ a cyber security protection program that is based on proven industry frameworks this program includes but is not limited to cyber security techniques tactics and procedures including the deployment of a robust set of security controls continuous monitoring and detection programs network protections vendor selection criteria secure software development programs and ongoing employee training awareness and incident response preparedness in addition we continuously scan our environment for any vulnerabilities perform penetration testing engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our security measures and collaborate with members of the cyber security community however there are no assurances that such programs will prevent or detect cyber security breaches 

from time to time we have been and likely will continue to be the target of cyber and other security threats in april 2017 malware was detected in our payment processing network that was designed to access payment card data from cards used at pointofsale devices at most of our restaurants we removed the malware from our systems and enhanced our security measures however we incurred significant costs and legal liabilities in connection with this incident see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to our financial statements for a description of this incident some of our guests also have experienced account takeover fraud in which guests use the same log in credentials on multiple websites and when a third party obtains those credentials they can gain unauthorized access to their accounts and charge food orders to the credit card linked to the account without accessing credit card data we may in the future become subject to other legal proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our consumers’ credit or debit card information or if consumer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately any such claim or proceeding or any adverse publicity resulting from such an event may have a material adverse effect on our business and the potential of incurring significant remediation costs 

security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability for example the european union adopted a regulation that became effective in may 2018 called the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations additionally the california privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which became effective on january 1 2020 provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems or fail to properly respond to consumer requests under the ccpa we could experience reputational damage adverse publicity loss of consumer confidence reduced sales and profits complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk including criminal penalties or civil liabilities 

compliance with the gdpr the ccpa and other current and future applicable international and us privacy cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and timeconsuming we make significant investments in technology thirdparty services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss in addition media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our thirdparty business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred 

  

  

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive if we are not able to compete successfully our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to taste price food quality and selection customer service brand reputation digital engagement advertising levels and promotional initiatives and the location attractiveness and maintenance of restaurants we also compete with a number of nontraditional market participants such as convenience stores grocery stores coffee shops and meal kit delivery services competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years particularly in urbanized areas and is expected to continue to increase increased competition could have an adverse effect on our sales profitability and development plans if consumer or dietary preferences change if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets our business could be adversely affected 

we continue to believe that our commitment to higherquality and responsibly sourced ingredients gives us a competitive advantage however more competitors have made claims related to the quality of their ingredients and lack of artificial flavors colors and preservatives the increasing use of these claims by competitors regardless of the accuracy of such claims may lessen our differentiation and make it more difficult for us to compete if we are unable to continue to maintain our distinctiveness and compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we are not able to hire train reward and retain qualified restaurant crew andor if we are not able to appropriately plan our workforce our growth plan and profitability could be adversely affected 

we rely on our restaurantlevel employees to consistently provide highquality food and experiences to our guests in addition our ability to continue to open new restaurants depends on our ability to recruit train and retain highquality crew members to manage and work in our restaurants maintaining appropriate staffing in our existing restaurants and hiring and training staff for our new restaurants requires precise workforce planning if we fail to appropriately plan our workforce it could adversely impact guest satisfaction operational efficiency and restaurant profitability in addition if we fail to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction it could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization efforts the low level of unemployment in the united states is resulting in aggressive competition for talent wage inflation and pressure to improve benefits and workplace conditions to remain competitive a shortage of quality candidates who meet legal citizenship or work authorization requirements our failure to recruit and retain new restaurant crew members in a timely manner or higher employee turnover levels all could affect our ability to open new restaurants and grow sales at existing restaurants and we may experience higher than projected labor costs 

substantially all of our restaurants operate in leased properties subject to longterm leases if we are unable to secure new leases on favorable terms terminate unfavorable leases or renew or extend favorable leases our profitability may suffer 

substantially all of our restaurants operate in leased facilities l ocating and securing suitable lease facilities for new restaurants is becoming increasing challenging as competition for restaurant sites in our target markets is intense development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors could negatively impact our ability to manage our occupancy costs which may adversely impact our profitability in addition any of these factors may be exacerbated by economic factors which may result in an increased demand for developers and contractors that could drive up our construction and leasing costs also as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our existing restaurant base will decline making it increasingly difficult to achieve levels of sales and profitability growth that we achieved in prior years 

from time to time we close or relocate a restaurant as a result of adverse economic conditions in an area if a current location becomes less profitable because substantially all of our restaurants operate in leased facilities we may incur significant lease termination expenses when we close or relocate a restaurant and are often obligated to continue rent and other lease related payments after restaurant closure we also may incur significant asset impairment and other charges in connection with closures and relocations if the lease termination cost is significant we may decide to keep underperforming restaurants open ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could decrease our results of operations in addition we may be unable to renew a lease or be unable to renew a lease without substantial additional cost at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks that may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

  

  

if we are unable to meet our projections for new restaurant openings or efficiently maintain the attractiveness of our existing restaurants our profitability could suffer 

our growth strategy depends on our ability to continue to open new restaurants and operate them profitably historically it could take up to 24 months to ramp up a new restaurant during which the restaurant generates sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize and during which costs may be higher as we train new employees and adjust our food deliveries and preparation to sales trends if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect or overcome the initial higher fixed costs associated with new restaurants our new restaurants may not be as profitable as our existing restaurants our ability to open and profitably operate new restaurants also is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease terms the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses and to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of capable contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage labor activities that could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

in addition in an effort to increase samerestaurant sales and improve our operating performance we continue to improve our existing restaurants through our remodels and upgrades if the costs associated with remodels or upgrades are higher than anticipated restaurants are closed for remodeled for longer periods than planned or remodeled restaurants do not perform as expected we may not realize our projected desired return on investment which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

there has been a marked increase in the use of social media and similar platforms including blogs microblogs videosharing and messaging platforms and other forms of internetbased communications that allow immediate access to a broad audience these platforms have dramatically increased the speed of dissemination and accessibility of information including negative publicity related to food safety incidents and guest experience information whether accurate or inaccurate can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond or address an issue the dissemination of information via social media could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on social media platforms to attract and retain guests new social media platforms are rapidly being developed potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to us these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information the inappropriate use of social media by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

our failure to comply with various applicable federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business 

various federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees and similar laws and regulations apply to our operations outside of the us these laws and regulations relate to matters such as employment discrimination wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules healthcare laws scheduling notification requirements and antidiscrimination and antiharassment laws complying with these laws and regulations subjects us to substantial expense and noncompliance could expose us to significant liabilities for example a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee classification employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we incur legal costs to defend and we could suffer losses from these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant in addition several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases changes to eligibility for overtime pay paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements these changes have increased our labor costs and may have a further negative impact on our labor costs in the future 

  

  

in addition several jurisdictions including new york city have implemented fair workweek or secure scheduling legislation which impose complex requirements related to scheduling for certain restaurant and retail employee and sick paypaid time off legislation which requires employers to provide paid time off to employees other jurisdictions where we operate are considering enacting similar legislation   all of these regulations impose additional obligations on us and could increase our costs of doing business our failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could lead to higher employee turnover and negative publicity and subject us to penalties and other legal liabilities which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in addition a significant number of our restaurant crew are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage federal state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters could to the extent implemented materially increase our labor and other costs several states in which we operate have approved minimum wage increases that are above the federal minimum as more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases we expect our labor costs will continue to increase our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices depends on willingness of our guests to pay the higher prices and our perceived value relative to competitors our distributors and suppliers could also be affected by higher minimum wage benefit standards and compliance costs which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us 

additionally while our employees are not currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize our employees and those of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to become covered by collective bargaining agreements our labor costs could increase and it could negatively impact our culture and reduce our flexibility to attract and retain top performing employees 

increase in ingredient and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs including ingredients paper supplies fuel utilities and distribution and other operating costs including leasing costs and labor any volatility in key commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability the markets for some of the ingredients we use such as beef avocado and chicken are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts climate conditions industry demand including as a result of animal disease outbreaks in other parts of the world international commodity markets food safety concerns product recalls and government regulation increasing weather volatility or other longterm changes in global weather patterns including any changes associated with global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients these factors are beyond our control and in many instances unpredictable volatility in prices or disruptions in supply also may result from governmental actions such as changes in traderelated tariffs or controls sanctions and counter sanctions governmentmandated closure of our suppliers’ operations and asset seizures the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries whether or not they have merit or the impact of these other measures may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm 

we also could be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and animal welfare criteria or other ingredients grown in accordance with our food with integrity specifications the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for conventionally raised or grown ingredients any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef dairy for cheese and sour cream avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would have a particularly adverse effect on our operating results alternatively in the event the cost of one or more ingredients significantly increases we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as guacamole or one of our proteins that use those ingredients rather than pay the increased cost any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and could adversely impact our sales and brand we can only partially address future price risk through forward contracts careful planning and other activities and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of ingredients could adversely affect our operating results 

our business is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of ingredients that comply with our food with integrity specifications shortages delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers distributors or transportation providers or other conditions beyond our control in addition we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients including certain cuts of beef tomatoes and adobo although we believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of ingredients shortages or interruptions in our supply of ingredients could adversely affect our financial results 

  

  

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane earthquake or manmade disaster including fire or terrorism at our restaurant support centers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims in addition these threats are constantly evolving which increases the difficulty of accurately and timely predicting planning for and protecting against the threat as a result our disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans security may not adequately address all threats we face or protect us from loss 

our failure to effectively manage our growth could have a negative adverse effect on our business and financial results 

as of december 31 2019 we operated 2619 chipotle restaurants and we plan to open a significant number of new restaurants in the next few years our existing restaurant management systems back office technology systems and processes financial and management controls information systems and personnel may not be adequate to support our continued growth to effectively manage our growth we may need to upgrade expand or enhance our infrastructure and information systems as well as hire train and retain restaurant crew and corporate support staff which may result in increased costs or inefficiencies we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we continue to grow it may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture our failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business and operating results 

the increasing impact of and focus on sustainability and climate change could increase our costs harm our reputation and adversely affect our financial results 

there has been increasing public focus by investors environmental activists the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on social and environmental sustainability matters including packaging and waste animal health and welfare human rights carbon footprints deforestation and land use in addition we and our supply chain are subject to increased costs arising from the effects of climate change greenhouse gases and diminishing energy and water resources as a result we have experienced increased pressure to make commitments relating to social and environmental sustainability set sciencebased targets related to climate change and establish specific strategic initiatives relating to sustainability if we are not effective in addressing social and environmental sustainability matters or set and meet achievable sustainability goals consumer trust in our brand may suffer in addition the costs to achieve our sustainability goals and the increased costs in our supply chain resulting from the impact of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

if w e do not continue to persuade consumers of the benefits of paying higher prices for our higher quality food our sales and results of operations could be hurt  

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade consumers that food made with ingredients that were raised or grown in accordance with our food with integrity principles is worth paying a higher price at our restaurants relative to prices of some of our competitors particularly quickservice restaurant competitors under our food with integrity principles for example animals must be responsibly raised and the milk in our sour cream cheese and queso must come from cows that have not been treated with rbgh which practices typically are more costly than traditional farming if we are not able to successfully persuade consumers that consuming food made consistent with our food with integrity principles is better for them and the environment or if consumers are not willing to pay the prices we charge our sales could be adversely affected which would negatively impact our results of operations 

  

  

we could be party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business results of operations and reputation 

we have been and in the future could be subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business these legal proceedings may involve claims brought by employees guests government agencies suppliers shareholders or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these legal proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour vacation and family leave laws discrimination and wrongful termination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of our food products data security or privacy breaches guest discrimination personal injury in our restaurants trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns for example several lawsuits were filed against us in connection with malware that we detected in our payment processing network in 2017 alleging among other things that we negligently failed to provide adequate security to protect the payment card information of our customers a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state employment laws including wage and hour claims and we are the subject of an official criminal investigation being conducted by the us attorney’s office for the central district of california in conjunction with the us food and drug administration’s office of criminal investigations related to companywide food safety matters dating back to january 1 2013 see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to our financial statements for a description of potential liabilities in connection with these matters   we could be involved in similar or even more significant litigation and legal proceedings in the future even if the allegations against us in current or future legal matters are unfounded or we ultimately are not held liable the costs to defend ourselves may be significant and the litigation may subject us to substantial settlements fines penalties or judgments against us and may divert managements attention away from operating our business all of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations litigation also may generate negative publicity regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are liable which could damage our reputation and adversely impact our sales and our relationship with our employees 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic growth plans and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

our ability to continue to grow our business depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive leadership team and other key management personnel changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support our strategic initiatives or to build adequate bench strength with key skillsets required for seamless succession of leadership could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets if we are unable to attract develop retain and incentivize sufficiently experienced and capable management personnel our business and financial results may suffer 

our digital business which has become an increasing significant part of our business is subject to risks 

in 2019 18 of our revenue was derived from digital orders which includes delivery and customer pickup we have implemented technology targeted advertising and promotions and remodeled our restaurants including adding chipotlanes to accommodate the growth of our digital business if we do not continue to grow our digital business it may be difficult for us to achieve our planned sales growth we rely on thirdparty delivery services to fulfill delivery orders and the ordering and payment platforms used by these thirdparties or our mobile app or online ordering system could be interrupted by technological failures user errors cyberattacks or other factors which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation additionally our delivery partners are responsible for order fulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries could cause guests to stop ordering from us the thirdparty restaurant delivery business is intensely competitive with a number of players competing for market share online traffic capital and delivery drivers if the thirdparty delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail operations increase their fees or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted 

general business and regulatory risks 

we are subject to extensive laws government regulation and other legal requirements and our failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could adversely affect our operational efficiencies ability to attract and retain talent and results of operations 

our business is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations including those relating to 

 preparation sale and labeling of food including regulations of the food and drug administration which oversees the safety of the entire food system including inspections and mandatory food recalls menu labeling and nutritional content 

 employment practices and working conditions including minimum wage rates wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety immigration overtime discrimination and harassment among others 

  

  

  

 health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages 

 building and zoning requirements including state and local licensing and regulation governing the design and operation of facilities and land use 

 public accommodations and safety conditions including the americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas 

 environmental matters such as animal health and welfare climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases water consumption the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances and local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants 

 public company compliance disclosure and governance matters including accounting and tax regulations sec and nyse disclosure requirements 

 data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information and payment card industry standards and requirements 

compliance with these laws and regulations and future new laws or changes in these laws or regulations that impose additional requirements can be costly any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

economic and business factors that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and the results of our operations 

restaurant dining generally is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending which may be affected by general economic conditions that are largely beyond our control for example international domestic and regional economic conditions consumer income levels financial market volatility a slow or stagnant pace of economic growth rising energy costs rising interest rates social unrest and governmental political and budget concerns may have a negative effect on consumer confidence and discretionary spending any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average transactions would negatively impact our financial performance any actual or perceived threat of a pandemic or communicable disease terrorist attack mass shooting heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could harm our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of the above factors or other unfavorable changes in business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or limit our ability to increase pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations these factors also could cause us to among other things reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings close restaurants or delay remodeling of our existing restaurant locations further poor economic conditions may force nearby businesses to shut down which could reduce traffic to our restaurants or cause our restaurant locations to be less attractive 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly including due to factors that are not in our control 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet investors’ expectations for various reasons including 

 negative publicity about the safety of our food employmentrelated issues litigation or other issues involving our restaurants 

 fluctuations in supply costs particularly for our most significant ingredients and our inability to offset the higher cost with price increases without adversely impacting guest traffic 

 labor availability and wages of restaurant management and crew 

 increases in marketing or promotional expenses 

 the timing of new restaurant openings and related revenues and expenses and the operating costs at newly opened restaurants 

 the impact of inclement weather and natural disasters such as freezes and droughts which could decrease guest traffic and increase the costs of ingredients 

  

  

  

 the amount and timing of stockbased compensation 

 litigation settlement costs and related legal expenses 

 tax expenses impairment charges and nonoperating costs and 

 variations in general economic conditions including the impact of declining interest rates on our interest income 

as a result of any of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease 

the market price of our common stock may be more volatile than the market price of our peers 

we believe the market price of our common stock generally has traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most of our peer companies which typically has reflected market expectations for higher future operating results the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times as well including during the recent past as a result of adverse publicity events as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of chipotle which could adversely affect the price of our common stock  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of chipotle without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between chipotle and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders which could adversely affect the price of our common stock

overview 

as of december 31 2019 we operated 2580 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states 39 international chipotle restaurants and three nonchipotle restaurants we are committed to making good food more accessible to everyone while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose 

2019 financial highlights 

 revenue increased 148 to 56 billion in 2019 compared to 49 billion in 2018

sales trends average restaurant sales were 22 million for the year ended december 31 2019 an increase from 20 million for the year ended december 31 2018 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months 

comparable restaurant sales increased 111 for the full year 2019 which included a 7 increase in comparable restaurant transactions comparable restaurant sales and comparable restaurant transactions represent the change in periodoverperiod sales or transactions for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months we expect our full year 2020 comparable restaurant sales to be in the midsingle digit range 

we continue to invest in improving our digital platforms and have significantly upgraded our capabilities by completing the rollout of digital pickup shelves digitizing almost all of our digitalmake lines and expanding our delivery capabilities to over 98 of our store base digital sales from outofrestaurant orders including delivery orders increased 71 to 180 of revenue for the full year 2019 an increase from 109 of revenue for the full year 2018 

restaurant operating costs  during the full year 2019 our restaurant operating costs food beverage and packaging labor occupancy and other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased 180 basis points to 795 compared to 813 for the full year 2018 the decrease was primarily due to comparable restaurant sales increases partially offset by higher food costs across many items and food expenses related to the launch of chipotle rewards as well as wage inflation and increased delivery expenses 

corporate restructuring in 2018 we opened a new headquarters office in newport beach california consolidated certain corporate administrative functions into our existing office in columbus ohio closed a corporate office in new york new york and commenced the closure of our previous headquarters office in denver colorado all affected employees were either offered an opportunity to continue in the new organization or were offered a severance package in total we recognized corporate restructuring activities of 568 million of which 142 million was recognized during the full year 2019 we do not expect any other material costs to be incurred in connection with the corporate restructuring for additional information please see note 5 “corporate restructuring” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

restaurant closures  in june 2018 we announced planned restaurant closures of approximately 55 to 65 restaurants beginning in the second quarter of 2018 and continuing over the next several quarters we have closed or relocated 51 chipotle restaurants and five pizzeria locale restaurants in connection with this initiative in total we recognized restaurant exit costs of approximately 365 million of which 08 million was recognized during the full year 2019 we do not expect any other material costs to be incurred in connection with the planned restaurant closures for additional information please see note 6 “restaurant closure costs” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

restaurant development for the full year 2019 we opened 140 new restaurants which included 56 restaurants with a chipotlane we expect to open between 150 to 165 new restaurants in 2020 with a heavier weighting of openings towards the second half of the year 

restaurant activity 

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 



results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod change are discussed in the following section 

revenue 



the significant factors contributing to the revenue increase in 2019 were comparable restaurant sales increases and new restaurant openings comparable restaurant sales increased 4987 million and revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed 2227 million to the revenue increase of which 766 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2019 in 2019 comparable restaurant sales increased 111 as a result of a 70 increase in comparable restaurant transactions and a 41 increase in average check the increase in average check includes a 24 benefit from menu price increases that were implemented at the end of 2018 and a 02 benefit from menu price increases implemented at the end of 2019 

food beverage and packaging costs   



food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2019 primarily due to higher protein costs food expenses related to the launch of chipotle rewards in march of 2019 and to a lesser extent higher costs of cheese avocados and beverages these increases were partially offset by the menu price increases taken at the end of 2018 

labor costs   



  

  

labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2019 primarily due to sales leverage partially offset by wage inflation 

occupancy costs   



occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2019 and 2018 primarily due to sales leverage on a largely fixedcost base 

other operating costs   



other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs bank and credit card processing fees restaurant utilities and maintenance costs and delivery expense other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2019 primarily due to sales leverage and to a lesser extent elevated store repairs and maintenance in 2018 this was partially offset by increased delivery expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 as we launched delivery during the middle of 2018 and delivery sales or transactions grew substantially in 2019 

general and administrative expenses   



general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms in 2019 primarily due to the following a 416 million increase in estimated loss contingencies related to a number of legal matters 292 million increase in wage and payroll tax expense which includes increased expense for performance bonuses and increased payroll tax expense from stockbased compensation 250 million in noncash stockbased compensation expense which includes increased expense for performance shares in the current year 95 million to support our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and increased legal expense of 28 million these increases were partially offset by a 146 million reduction in restructuring expense an 114 million reduction in estimated charges related to the data security incident and a reduction of 73 million primarily associated with the biennial all managers’ conference that was held in september 2018 

depreciation and amortization   



depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2019 due to sales leverage on a partially fixedcost base partially offset by increased depreciation associated with our website and mobile app and upgrading equipment in the restaurants primarily to support the growth in our digital business 

  

  

impairment closure costs and asset disposals 



impairment closure costs and asset disposals during 2019 consisted primarily of charges related to the replacement of certain kitchen equipment and leasehold improvements and to a lesser extent impairments on equipment restaurants and offices 

provision for income tax 



the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 was lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to net excess benefits from stockbased compensation and a net year over year decrease in tax expense related to equity award expirations partially offset by current year increases in nondeductible executive compensation 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

see note 14 “quarterly financial data unaudited” for a table presenting data from the consolidated statements of income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2019 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases or promotional activities and other marketing initiatives the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results although on an overall annual basis changes in trading days do not have a significant impact 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of non cash stockbased compensation expense and related tax rate impacts litigation settlement costs and related legal expenses impairment charges and nonoperating costs timing of marketing or promotional expenses the number and timing of new restaurants opened in a quarter and closure of restaurants new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with their opening and operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction initiatives to improve the guest experience in our restaurants working capital and general corporate expenses as of december 31 2019 we had a cash and shortterm investment balance of 8808 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital in support of the growth of our business to invest in maintain and refurbish our existing restaurants to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions and for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2019 1694 million remained available for repurchases of shares of our common stock repurchase authorizations under the remaining repurchase authorizations shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions subject to market conditions we believe that cash from operations together with our cash and investment balances will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 

  

  

we have not required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverages and supplies sometime after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

our total capital expenditures for 2019 were 3339 million in 2019 we spent on average about 10 million in development and construction costs per new restaurant or about 09 million net of landlord reimbursements of 01 million in 2020 we expect to incur about 350 million in total capital expenditures we expect approximately 160 million in capital expenditures related to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements for new restaurants to be opened in 2020 we anticipate average development costs will increase due to strategic initiatives planned in new restaurants such as design updates or the addition of chipotlanes we expect approximately 140 million in capital expenditures related to investments in existing restaurants including updated equipment technology remodeling and similar improvements and upgrading our digital make lines and other restaurant equipment finally we expect a portion of our capital expenditures for the year to be incurred for additional corporate initiatives including building corporate offices a culinary and training center rebuilding our mobile app and other projects 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 were as follows 



1 see note 11 “leases” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” this includes commitments related to reasonably certain renewal periods 

2 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty the majority of our purchase obligations relate to amounts owed for produce and other ingredients and supplies chicken orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction and planned remodels information technology and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships 

the above table does not include income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments additionally we have excluded our estimated loss contingencies due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of payment see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor rent healthcare costs fuel utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level additionally many of our leases require us to pay property taxes maintenance and utilities all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases if we do raise menu prices in the future general competitive pressures or negative consumer responses may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors 

leases 

we determine if a contract contains a lease at inception our material operating leases consist of restaurant locations and office space our leases generally have remaining terms of 120 years and most include options to extend the leases for additional 5year periods generally the lease term is the minimum of the noncancelable period of the lease or the lease term inclusive of reasonably certain renewal periods up to a term of 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably certain lease term was changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments initial direct costs lease incentives and impairment of operating lease assets to determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid we estimate incremental borrowing rates corresponding to the reasonably certain lease term as we have no outstanding debt nor committed credit facilities secured or otherwise we estimate this rate based on prevailing financial market conditions comparable company and credit analysis and management judgment if the estimate of our incremental borrowing rate was changed our operating lease assets and liabilities could differ materially 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets to be held and used for potential impairment assets are grouped together at the market level or in the case of a potential relocation or closure at the restaurant level we manage our restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities as such an individual restaurant’s cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market 

the fair value measurement for asset impairment is based on level 3 inputs we first compare the carrying value of the asset or asset group referred interchangeably throughout as asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value the estimated fair value of the asset is generally determined using the income approach to measure the fair value which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows key inputs to the income approach for restaurant assets include the discount rate projected restaurant cash flows and sublease income if we are closing the restaurant in certain cases management uses other market information when available to estimate the fair value of an asset the impairment charges represent the excess of each asset’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value and are allocated among the longlived asset or assets of the group 

our estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on internal projections and knowledge of our operations historical performance and trends in sales and restaurant operating costs and can be significantly impacted by changes in our business or economic conditions the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment and utilizes valuation techniques including discounting estimated future cash flows and marketbased analyses to determine fair value if our estimates or underlying assumptions including discount rate and sublease income change in the future our operating results may be materially impacted 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the requisite service period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights or “sosars” and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards and sosars with performancebased vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are 

  

  

based on a number of assumptions including but not limited to growth in comparable restaurant sales and average restaurant level margin and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or if we changed our assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations may be materially different   

insurance liability 

we are selfinsured for a significant portion of our employee health benefits programs and carry significant retentions for risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers’ compensation general liability property and auto damage employment practices liability cyber liability and directors and officer’s liability predetermined loss limits have been arranged with third party insurance companies to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business we record an accrual for legal contingencies when we determine that it is probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities including valuation allowance requires the use of estimates based on our management’s interpretation and application of complex tax laws and accounting guidance we are primarily subject to income taxes in the united states we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions for material known tax exposures in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the measurement and recognition of the item we may adjust these reserves when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available and will be reflected in the period in which the new information is available while we believe that our reserves are adequate issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related reserve and could materially increase or decrease our income tax provision in future periods ‎ 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

commodity price risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials and utilities to run our restaurants are ingredients or commodities that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices and range forward protocols under which we agree on a price range for the duration of that protocol generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 36 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where practical the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance 

changing interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2019 we had 8248 million in investments and interestbearing cash accounts including insurancerelated restricted trust accounts classified in restricted cash and 607 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest and other income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 175 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date

 item 1  business 

general 

chipotle mexican grill inc a delaware corporation together with its subsidiaries “chipotle” “we” “us” or “our” operates chipotle mexican grill restaurants which feature a relevant menu of burritos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla tacos and salads we are passionate about serving great food and providing a great guest experience and we are a longtime leader and innovator in the food industry when steve ells founder and executive chairman first opened chipotle starting with a single restaurant in denver colorado in 1993 the idea was simple show that food served fast didnt have to be a typical “fastfood” experience using highquality real ingredients classic cooking techniques and distinctive interior design we brought features from the realm of fine dining to the world of quickservice restaurants over 25 years later our devotion to seeking out the very best ingredients raised with respect for animals farmers and the environment remains at the core of our commitment to food with integrity as of december 31 2018 we operated 2452 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states 37 international chipotle restaurants and two nonchipotle restaurants 

business strategy 

we are committed to making our food more accessible to everyone while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose of cultivating a better world our strategy is to win today and cultivate the future by focusing on five key pillars which include 











﻿ 

relevant menu our restaurants feature a relevant menu of burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads in preparing our food we employ classic cooking methods and use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice our restaurants do not have microwaves or freezers our proteins include chicken steak carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy braised and 

  

 

  

shredded beef sofritas organic braised tofu and vegetarian pinto and black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice freshly chopped cilantro and a pinch of salt as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce and sautéed peppers and onions to our entrees depending on each guest’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also serve tortilla chips that are fried twice a day in each restaurant and seasoned with fresh lime juice and salt with sides of hand mashed guacamole salsas or queso in addition to sodas fruit and tea drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch some in our restaurants and some with the same fresh ingredients in larger batches in commissaries 

food with integrity serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our purpose so that guests can enjoy wholesome food every day we respect our environment and insist on preparing cooking and serving nutritious food made from natural ingredients and animals that are raised or grown with care we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised we concentrate on the sourcing of each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve the food we serve the food we serve is made from just 51 ingredients that everyone can both recognize and pronounce were all about simple fresh food without the use of artificial colors or flavors typically found in fast food—just genuine real ingredients and their individual delectable flavors 

in all of our chipotle restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that are raised in accordance with criteria we have established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare and without the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones we brand these meats as “responsibly raised ® ” one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to serve meats raised to meet our standards but we have and expect to continue to face challenges in doing so for example some of our restaurants periodically serve conventionally raised chicken or beef due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised brand meats or stop serving one or more menu items due to additional supply constraints when we become aware of such an issue we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that guests can adjust their orders if they choose to do so 

we also seek to use responsibly grown produce by which we mean produce grown by suppliers whose practices conform to our priorities with respect to environmental considerations and employee welfare some of the beans we serve are organically grown or grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown we call these beans “transitional” some of the other produce items we serve are organically grown as well our commitment to better ingredients also extends to the dairy products we serve in 2018 all of the sour cream and shredded cheese served in our us chipotle restaurants was made with milk from cows not given rbgh recombinant bovine growth hormone and sourced from pasturebased dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows 

in addition none of the ingredients in our food excluding beverages in us chipotle restaurants contain genetically modified organisms or gmos while the meat and poultry we serve is not genetically modified many of the animals are likely fed a diet of grains containing gmos due to the prevalence of gmos in a number of important feed crops the vast majority of the grains used as animal feed in the us are genetically modified additionally some of the beverages we serve are sweetened with cornbased sweeteners which are typically made with genetically modified corn

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality and safety we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our 24 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and the suppliers’ understanding of our mission we work closely with our suppliers and seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols and our distribution centers purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with suppliers we’ve also sought to increase where practical the number of suppliers for our ingredients to help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages in addition we closely monitor industry news trade tariffs and other issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas are purchased from a small number of suppliers for a discussion of risks related to our supply chain see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry –   failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations ”   and “ risks unique to our business strategy   –   our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks ”   in item 1a “risk factors” 

quality assurance and food safety we are committed to serving safe high quality food our food safety and quality assurance teams work to ensure compliance with our food safety programs and practices components of which include 







  

 

  









﻿ 

these and other food safety practices underscore our commitment to being a leader in food safety while continuing to serve high quality food that our guests love our food safety and quality assurance teams establish and monitor our quality and food safety programs and work closely with our suppliers to ensure our high standards are met throughout the supply chain we maintain a limited list of approved suppliers many of whom are among the top suppliers in the industry in addition we have a team approach where our training operations legal and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness employee health protocols and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also intended to ensure that we not only continue to comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations but also establish chipotle as an industry leader in food safety to help achieve this goal we have a food safety advisory council comprised of some of the nation’s foremost food safety authorities the food safety advisory council is charged with evaluating our programs both in practice and implementation and advising us on ways to elevate our already high standards for food safety 

guest experience and operations 

serving great food with great service in a safe quick clean and happy environment is always our highest priority and we take pride in making the chipotle experience exceptional we invest in training to consistently deliver an outstanding guest experience and in our facilities to improve the appearance of our restaurants and modernize tools these investments enable faster throughput better efficiency and a better team member experience in our restaurants in 2018 we hired a chief people officer to support our approximately 73000 team members we believe creating an excellent guest experience starts with hiring great people and creating great teams 

restaurant team each restaurant typically has a general manager or restaurateur a highperforming general manager an apprentice manager in a majority of our restaurants two or three hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 22 full and parttime crew members though our busier restaurants tend to have slightly more employees we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we also crosstrain our team members so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our employees the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our general managers and crew members to welcome and interact with guests throughout the day in addition to the employees serving our guests at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes field leaders and team directors as well as executive team directors who report to our chief restaurant officer 

innovation  we are prioritizing the development of technological and other innovations such as digitalmobile ordering platforms digital order pickup shelves digital order pickup lanes we call “chipotlanes” delivery and catering that allow our guests to engage with us in whatever fashion is most convenient for them by allowing our guests to order and receive their food in a variety of ways we believe we can attract more guests and encourage them to choose us more frequently in order to successfully deliver a great experience for more guests we are emphasizing the optimization of second make lines and the ability to pay using apple pay or android pay for digitalmobile orders these initiatives allow us to fulfill catering or digitalmobile orders without disrupting throughput on our main service line in fact technological innovations can enhance the experience of other guests by helping to improve throughput for those who choose to dine in our restaurants recent digital ordering innovations have allowed us to increase digital order volumes to the highest levels we’ve ever achieved and we believe continued improvements in these areas will allow us to further improve these results additionally we have enhanced our data capabilities to allow us to better identify individual guests and their unique frequency patterns and to target our marketing and promotional efforts at the individual level we believe the advancements we have made in this area will help us as we seek to make it as convenient as possible for our guests to enjoy chipotle when and how they like it we are also testing new menu items we have built a stagegate process around innovation where we test learn and iterate so that when we roll out a new initiative we are highly confident in the probability of success 

marketing 

our marketing program and philosophy shifted from a more promotionally driven decentralized approach in 2017 to a more centrally driven model designed to generate higher consumer awareness and drive guests into our restaurants in 2018 our ultimate marketing mission is to make chipotle not just a food brand but a purpose driven lifestyle brand that is more visible more engaging and more relevant in culture in october 2018  we launched the biggest quarterly brand campaign in our history with the “for real” launch reflecting our heritage and also reinforcing our differentiation of using responsibly sourced real ingredients and real cooking techniques to make flavorful food that consumers both love and feel better about eating 

  

 

  

we utilize multiple marketing channels including national television digital marketing social media fundraising events and sponsorships to reach consumers 

we have invested and will continue to invest in extensive customer research that will give us insight into our consumers in order to inform our business decisions media messaging and innovation pipeline

competition 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location convenience brand reputation cleanliness and ambience of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locallyowned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout online catering and delivery services among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally in recent years competition has increased significantly from restaurant formats like ours that serve higher quality food quickly and at a reasonable price  

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who seek higherquality food as well as from convenience stores cafeterias and other dining outlets meal kit delivery companies and other eatathome options also present some degree of competition for our restaurants 

competition has made it more challenging to maintain or increase the frequency of customer visits however we believe that we can differentiate ourselves with our purpose of cultivating a better world for more information see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry— competition could adversely affect us ” in item 1a “risk factors ” we also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees 

restaurant site selection   

we believe restaurant site selection is critical to our longterm success and growth strategy as a result we devote substantial time and effort to carefully evaluate each potential restaurant location our site selection process is led by our internal team of real estate managers and includes external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets as well as support from an internal real estate strategy and research group we thoroughly assess the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and available information on competitors and other restaurants based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment for each potential restaurant site we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as in line or endcap locations in strip or power centers in regional malls and downtown business districts freestanding buildings food courts outlet centers airports military bases and train stations

other restaurant concepts 

although in 2019 our focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based – finding better ingredients preparing them using classic techniques in front of our guests and serving them in an interactive format with great teams dedicated to providing an excellent dining experience – can be adapted to cuisines other than the food served at chipotle we have invested in innovative concepts such as pizzeria locale a fastcasual pizza restaurant that has two restaurants in denver colorado for a discussion of risks related to pizzeria locale and our possible investment in new concepts see “ risks unique to our business strategy – pizzeria locale and other new restaurant concepts may not contribute to our growth ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

information systems and cyber security 

we use a variety of applications and systems to securely manage the flow of information within each of our restaurants and centralized corporate infrastructure the services available within our systems and applications include restaurant operations supply chain inventory scheduling training human capital management financial tools and data protection services our digital ordering system allows guests to place orders online or through our mobile app and enables a delivery by a third party service with which we 

  

 

  

have entered into a delivery agreement we also continue to modernize and make investments in our information technology networks and infrastructure specifically in our physical and technological security measures to anticipate cyberattacks in order to combat breaches as well as provide improved control security and scalability 

in april 2017 our information security team detected unauthorized activity on the network that supports payment processing for our restaurants and immediately began an investigation with the help of leading computer security firms the investigation detected malware designed to access data from payment cards used at the pointofsale system at most of our restaurants the malware searched for track data which may include cardholder name card number expiration date and internal verification codes however no other customer information was affected we removed the malware from our systems and have been working to further enhance the security of our payment card network see “ general business risks — we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential guest and employee information ” in item 1a “risk factors” as well as note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion of the payment card security incident in 2017 related legal proceedings and other risks associated with our information systems

 item 1a risk fa ctors 

the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating our business or making an investment decision involving our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies including but not limited to overall economic and industry conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material also may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  

risks related to our plans to grow our sales and improve profitability 

our sales and profitability growth depends on our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales and there are material risks to our ability to do so 

to grow our average restaurant sales we will need to increase comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation changes in comparable restaurant sales are a critical factor affecting our profitability because the profit margin on incremental comparable restaurant sales is generally higher due to the sales increases being applied against a partially fixed cost base conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales as we have seen in some periods over the past three years have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases while we continue to incur a certain level of fixed costs 

our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

















﻿ 

these factors most of which are described in more detail in additional risk factors below are beyond our control to at least some degree as a result it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted or expected comparable restaurant sales in the future or may even experience declines in comparable restaurant sales in the future any declines in comparable restaurant sales or failure to meet market expectations for comparable restaurant sales increases would likely result in a significant adverse impact on the price of our common stock 

increasing our sales and profits depends in part on our ability to open new restaurants in sites and on terms attractive to us which is subject to many unpredictable factors and we plan to open fewer restaurants in 2019 than we have in many prior years which will adversely impact our sales growth rate 

we had 2491 restaurants in operation as of december 31 2018 and we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in 2019 we plan to open between 140 and 155 new restaurants which is fewer than the number of restaurants opened per 

  

 

  

year in many prior years we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any one or more of the following factors   





















﻿ 

one of our biggest challenges in opening new restaurants is staffing and training new restaurant teams we seek to hire only top performing employees train them extensively in order to help ensure we provide an outstanding guest experience and promote many general managers from our crew all of which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under “ — risks related to operating in the restaurant industry—our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs …” 

another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for restaurant sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors could negatively impact our ability to manage our occupancy costs which may adversely impact our profitability in addition any of these factors may be exacerbated by economic factors which may result in developers and contractors seeing increased demand and therefore driving up our construction and leasing costs moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our existing restaurant base will decline making it increasingly difficult to achieve levels of sales and profitability growth that we achieved prior to 2016 we expect this effect to be more pronounced through at least 2019 given our plan to decrease the number of new restaurants we open during the year as compared to the number of restaurants opened per year in many past years 

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods 

if we are unable to open the number of new restaurants we plan to open  or if we decide to continue opening fewer new restaurants than we have in past years or delay or forego a significant number of planned restaurant openings including due to any of the reasons set forth above this would adversely affect our growth any resulting decrease in our sales growth rate or investor expectations for our future growth may result in declines in the price of our common stock 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generate sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize after the restaurant has built a customer base and during which costs may be higher as we train new employees and adjust our food deliveries and preparation to sales volumes and peakhour trends if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have results similar to those of our existing restaurants and may not be profitable our new restaurant sales volumes since the fourth quarter of 2015 have also been negatively impacted by the food safety issues described elsewhere in this report and other adverse publicity and as a result the initial negative effect of new restaurants on our average restaurant sales over the past two years has been of greater magnitude than we have seen in the past this trend may continue into 2019 and beyond 

  

 

  

we have also opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants that we have recently opened  or may open in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as guests who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability alternatively e xisting restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market and could limit our growth potential if we determine that one or more of our nearby restaurants makes an otherwise viable new restaurant site unattractive to us 

in addition in the event we are not able to contain increases in our average restaurant development costs which could result from inflation an increase in the proportion of higher cost locations project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in lower returns on our investment in such new restaurants 

finally our new restaurant development activity has broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or types of restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and restaurants in airports food courts or on military sites these types of sites may become more important to our restaurant growth strategy as we find fewer opportunities to open in traditional sites given our past growth many of these site types may involve additional costs that we do not incur in our more traditional restaurant sites such as security costs or marketing costs  which will adversely impact the profitability of restaurants in these types of sites the risks related to building a customer base and managing development and operating costs in some or all of these types of trade areas or restaurant sites may also be more significant than in our traditional sites which could result in unexpected negative impacts on our new restaurant operating results 

our marketing and advertising strategies may not be successful or may pose risks that could adversely impact our business 

in 2018 we hired a new chief marketing officer and other senior marketing staff and introduced a new advertising campaign and media strategies including increased use of television advertising we intend to continue to invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will attract guests or increase their connection with our brand if these investments do not drive increased restaurant sales the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect additionally if our marketing and advertising strategies are not successful we may be forced to engage in additional promotional activities to attract and retain guests including buyone getone offers and other offers for free or discounted food and any such additional promotional activities could adversely impact our profitability 

we also plan to continue to emphasize strategies such as mobile and other digital ordering delivery orders and catering offerings in an effort to increase overall sales these efforts may not succeed to the degree we expect or may result in unexpected operational challenges that adversely impact our costs or our brand reputation we may also seek to introduce new menu items that may not generate the sales we expect 

in addition some of our marketing has incorporated elements intended to encourage guests to question sources or production methods commonly used to produce food these elements of our marketing could alienate food suppliers and other food industry groups and may potentially lead to an increased risk of disputes or litigation if suppliers or other constituencies believe our marketing is unfair or misleading increased costs in connection with any such issues or any deterioration in our relationships with existing suppliers could adversely impact us or our reputation furthermore if these messages do not resonate with our guests or potential guests the value of our brand may be eroded 

we may continue to be negatively impacted by food safety incidents and further instances of foodborne or localized illnesses associated with our restaurants would result in increased negative publicity and further adverse impacts on consumer perceptions of our brand 

during late october and early november 2015 illnesses caused by e coli bacteria were connected to a number of our restaurants initially in washington and oregon and subsequently to small numbers of our restaurants in as many as 12 other states during the week of december 7 2015 an unrelated incident involving norovirus was reported at a chipotle restaurant in brighton massachusetts which worsened the adverse financial and operating impacts we experienced from the e coli incident as a result of these incidents and related publicity our sales and profitability were severely impacted throughout 2016 in july 2017 cases of norovirus associated with a chipotle restaurant in sterling virginia had a further adverse impact on our sales particularly throughout the midatlantic and northeast regions and in august 2018 illnesses believed to be caused by c perfringens bacteria from the food in one of our restaurants in powell ohio also negatively impacted our sales the significant amount of media coverage regarding these incidents as well as the impact of social media which was not in existence during many past food safety incidents involving other restaurant chains increased the awareness of these incidents and negatively impacted perceptions of our restaurants and brand notwithstanding the high volume of foodborne illness cases from other sources across the country every day 

  

 

  

because of consumer perceptions in the wake of these food safety incidents any future occurrence of foodborne illness associated with our restaurants—even incidents that may be considered minor at other restaurants—may have an even more significant negative impact on our sales and our ability to regain guests although we have followed industry standard food safety protocols in the past and have endeavored to continually enhance our food safety procedures to ensure that our food is as safe as it can possibly be we may still be at a higher risk for foodborne illness occurrences than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh unprocessed produce and meats our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation and our avoid ance   of frozen ingredients additionally no food safety protocols can completely eliminate the risk of foodborne illness in any restaurant including as a result of possible failures by restaurant personnel or suppliers to follow food safety policies and procedures as a result our enhanced food safety protocols may not be successful in preventing illness incidents in the future the risk of illnesses associated with our food might also increase in connection with an expansion of our delivery or catering businesses or other situations in which our food is transported andor served in conditions we cannot control furthermore we have seen instances of unsubstantiated reports linking illnesses to chipotle and these reports have negatively impacted us even if foodborne illnesses are attributed to us erroneously or arise from conditions outside of our control the negative impact  both financially and otherwise from any such illnesses is likely to be significant all of these factors could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain guests  which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability  

our ability to continue to expand our digital business delivery orders and catering is uncertain and these new business lines are subject to risks 

for the year ended december 31 2018 109 of our revenue was derived from digital orders which was up significantly from prior years and during 2018 the percentage of revenue derived from digital orders grew from 89 in the first quarter to 129 in the fourth quarter this growth rate may not be sustainable for even the short term and if our digital business does not continue to expand it may be difficult for us to achieve our planned sales growth we have also increased our efforts to promote delivery orders which have also grown considerably we rely on third party providers to fulfill delivery orders and the ordering and payment platforms used by these third parties or our mobile app or online ordering system could be damaged or interrupted by technological failures user errors cyberattacks or other factors which may adversely impact our sales through these channels and could negatively impact our brand additionally our delivery partners are responsible for order fulfillment and may make errors or fail to make timely deliveries leading to customer disappointment that may negatively impact our brand we also incur additional costs associated with using third party service providers to fulfil these digital orders moreover the third party restaurant delivery business is intensely competitive with a number of players competing for market share online traffic capital and delivery drivers and other people resources the third party delivery services with which we work may struggle to compete effectively and if they were to cease or curtail operations or fail to provide timely delivery services in a costeffective manner or if they give greater priority on their platforms to our competitors our delivery business may be negatively impacted we have also introduced catering offerings on both a pickup and delivery basis and customers may choose our competitors’ catering offerings over ours be disappointed with their experience with our catering or experience food safety problems if they do not serve our food in a safe manner which may negatively impact us such delivery and catering offerings also increase the risk of illnesses associated with our food because the food is transported andor served by third parties in conditions we cannot control 

because all of these offerings are relatively new it is difficult for us to anticipate the level of sales they may generate that may result in operational challenges both in fulfilling orders made through these channels and in operating our restaurants as we balance fulfillment of these orders with service of our traditional inrestaurant guests as well any such operational challenges may negatively impact the customer experience associated with our digital delivery or catering orders the guest experience for our traditional inrestaurant business or both these factors may adversely impact our sales and our brand reputation 

our expansion into international markets has been limited and may present increased risks due to lower awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors 

as of december 31 2018 37 of our restaurants were located outside of the us with 23 in canada seven in the united kingdom six in france and one in frankfurt germany our focus for the present time remains on expanding in north america which limits our nearterm growth potential 

  

 

  

as a result of our small number of restaurants outside the us and the relatively short time we have been operating those restaurants we have lower brand awareness and less operating experience in these international markets and our average restaurant sales andor transaction counts may be lower in these international markets than in the us the markets in which we’ve opened restaurants outside the us and any additional new markets we enter outside the us in the future have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our us markets as a result new restaurants outside the us may be less successful than restaurants in our existing us markets specifically due to lower consumer familiarity with the chipotle brand differences in consumer tastes or spending patterns or for other reasons sales at restaurants opened outside the us may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall growth and profitability to build brand awareness in international markets we may need to make greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned or than we need to for a new restaurant in a us market  which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations in those international markets 

we may also find it more difficult in international markets to hire train and keep top performing employees who can successfully deliver excellent guest experiences and labor costs may be higher in international markets due to increased regulation higher employment taxes or social benefit costs or local market conditions in addition restaurants outside the us have had higher construction occupancy and food costs than those in the us and we may have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards additional costs or difficulties from any of the foregoing factors may adversely impact the operating results of our international markets markets outside the us may also have regulatory differences with the us with which we are not familiar or that subject us to significant additional expense or to which we are not able to successfully adapt which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could adversely impact our overall results for example a new privacy regulation in the european union called the general data protection regulation or gdpr became effective in may 2018 and requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties up to 4 of our worldwide revenue of the prior financial year  our overall results may also be negatively affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar 

our failure to manage our growth and transformation effectively could harm our business and operating results 

as described elsewhere in this report our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants new employees new suppliers and new systems to support our business strategies our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls information systems and personnel may be inadequate to support our expansion and managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls as well as to hire train and retain general managers crew and corporate staff we also are continuing to attempt to improve our field management in an effort to improve restaurant operations  including food safety and develop additional top performing general managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our growth and transformation impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate as we grow our number of restaurants additional shifts in our cultural or operational focus may harm morale in our restaurants or prove distracting to our restaurant employees which could adversely impact our business and operating results 

risks related to operating in the restaurant industry 

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location brand reputation and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locallyowned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout online catering and delivery services among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally in recent years competition has also increased significantly from restaurant formats like ours that serve higher quality food quickly and at a reasonable price moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at consumers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores cafeterias and other dining outlets meal kit delivery companies and other eatathome options also present some degree of competition for our restaurants in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as guests who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

  

 

  

we believe that competition from all of the foregoing has made it more challenging to maintain or increase the frequency of our guest visits and that those competitive pressures will continue or increase in the future many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have these and other competitors may attract guests with among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs and prices better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

additionally although we continue to believe that chipotle can differentiate itself with our commitment to higherquality and responsiblysourced ingredients competitors have increasingly made claims related to the quality of their ingredients or distinctions between artificial and natural flavors colors and preservatives the increasing use of these claims in the marketplace even if the substantive basis for some of them may be questionable may lessen our differentiation and make it more difficult for us to compete some of these competitors and other fast casual concepts have sought to duplicate various elements of our business operations and more chains may copy us to varying degrees in the future 

several of our competitors also compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for guests or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these and other competing products or by price competition more generally 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding training and retaining top performing employees 

we rely on our restaurant employees to provide an outstanding guest experience and as a result we believe good managers and crew and outstanding training are key parts of our success delivering excellent guest experiences depends substantially on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire train motivate and keep qualified employees especially general managers and crew members turnover among our restaurant crews and managers has been frequent and we aim to reduce turnover in an effort to keep top performing employees and better realize our investment in training new employees failure to do so will adversely impact our operating results by increasing training costs and making it more difficult to deliver outstanding guest experiences which may adversely impact our sales our failure to find and keep enough highcaliber employees could also delay planned restaurant openings which would slow our growth 

in addition labor is a primary component of our operating costs increased labor costs due to factors such as competition for workers and labor market pressures increased minimum wage requirements increased healthcare costs increased costs to apply with new andor changing regulations paid sick leave or vacation accrual mandates or changes in our restaurant staffing structure have and may continue to adversely impact our operating costs many companies both in the restaurant industry and in other industries with which we compete for employees have implemented companywide or targeted increases in starting wages or other enhancements to their compensation and benefit programs and we may need to act similarly to continue to attract employees during 2018 we increase d benefits to salaried and hourly managers including additional paid leave short term disability coverage and a onetime cash bonus to all restaurant employees which increase d our labor costs these enhancements and any further increases in labor costs associated with additional market pressures on wages or other factors will adversely impact our operating results 

moreover if our managers do not schedule our restaurant crews efficiently our restaurants may be overstaffed at some times which adversely impacts our labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreasing our operating margins efficient staffing may continue to be a challenge in 201 9 due to continued volatility and uncertainty in our sales trends additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits expenses could also adversely impact our labor costs 

because we do not franchise risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring payment and termination of employees and employeerelated litigation may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions global demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and cooking oils has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice efforts to negotiate with suppliers to limit any such price increases may not be successful or may adversely impact our relationship with suppliers 

  

 

  

additionally a substantial volume of produce items are grown in mexico and other countries and a significant portion of our meats and restaurant supplies are sourced from outside the us as well any new or increased import duties tariffs or taxes or other changes in us trade or tax policy including any new or increased export duties tariffs or taxes or other changes in trade or tax policy as a result of retaliation by the countries from which we source our ingredients in response to such changes in us trade or tax policy or any localized labor disturbances or political unrest in the areas from which we source our ingredients could result in higher food and supply costs that would adversely impact our financial results 

we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and animal welfare criteria or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for food products that are conventionally raised and grown weather related issues such as freezes or drought may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as produce or meats increasing weather volatility or other longterm changes in global weather patterns including any changes associated with global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would have a particularly adverse effect on our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales and could also have an adverse impact on our brand 

food safety scares could adversely affect consumer perceptions of or the price or availability of ingredients we use to prepare our food which may adversely impact our sales  

past reports linking nationwide or regional incidents of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella e coli hepatitis a or listeria to certain produce items or other ingredients have caused us to temporarily suspend serving some ingredients in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu or have resulted in consumers avoiding certain food products for a period of time similarly outbreaks of avian flu incidents of “mad cow” disease or similar concerns have also caused consumers to avoid any products that are or are suspected of being affected these problems and injuries caused by food tampering have had and could in the future have an adverse effect on the availability of affected ingredients a decrease in guest traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants due to the types of food scares described above would further adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability in addition if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose guests who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new guests to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable guests may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient or operating costs resulting from supply problems or operational changes associated with incidents of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

changes we have made in our operations or that we make in the future to further enhance the safety of the food we serve will adversely impact our financial performance and may negatively impact consumer perception of our brand  

as a result of the food safety incidents described elsewhere in this report we have implemented a number of enhancements to our food safety protocols to ensure that our food is as safe as it can be many of our enhanced procedures which go beyond the industrystandard food safety practices that we were previously following increase the cost of some ingredients or the amount of labor required to prepare and serve our food if we are not able to sufficiently increase sales to offset the increased costs resulting from these changes our margins will fall well short of levels we have historically achieved and may not meet analyst and investor expectations in the future even if we were to restore sales to levels we were achieving prior to the fourth quarter of 2015 the increased costs from these changes are likely to result in lower margins than we were able to achieve in the past 

additionally some of the enhanced food safety procedures we have introduced or may introduce in the future rely on increased use of centralized food preparation additional inrestaurant preparation steps or new ingredients some or all of which may be inconsistent with previous guest perceptions of our restaurant operations to the extent guests perceive any of these developments as a move away from our food with integrity strategy andor towards a more traditional fast food experience our ability to win back guests may be adversely impacted and our sales may decline or recover more slowly than they otherwise would have furthermore even the most advanced food safety measures cannot eliminate all food safety risks from a restaurant environment for risks related to any future food safety incidents associated with our restaurants see “ — risks related to our plans to grow our sales and profitability—we may continue to be negatively impacted by food safety incidents ” 

  

 

  

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations 

our ability to provide the experience our guests expect depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers unavailability of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or deciding not to follow our required protocols or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients in particular shortages of one or more of our menu items could force our restaurants to remove items from their menus which may result in guests choosing to eat elsewhere if that happens our affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the menu item shortage and potentially thereafter if guests do not return to us after the shortage is resolved our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe to us than at other restaurants 

for many of our food ingredients and other supplies we do not have longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on a third  party distribution network with a limited number of distribution partners if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason the risk of ingredient shortages may increase and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken tofu beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our food with integrity suppliers and as described in more detail below under “ — risks unique to our business strategy—our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks ” these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants 

changes in consumer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in consumer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences including in response to dietary concerns such as preferences regarding calories sodium carbohydrates fat  consumption of animal products or other nutritional considerations these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods and our focus on a limited menu could make the consequences of a change in consumer preferences more severe than our competitors may face some consumers could also avoid freshlyprepared foods like those we serve based on concerns regarding food safety this may be more likely to impact us as a result of the widelypublicized food safety incidents we experienced beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 

our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels our average restaurant sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty which can be caused by various factors such as high unemployment increasing taxes interest rates or other changes in fiscal or monetary policy high gasoline prices declining home prices tight credit markets or political or economic unrest in the us andor abroad any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends we may lose guests and our sales may deteriorate 

if we were to experience widespread difficulty renewing existing leases on favorable terms our revenue or occupancy costs could be adversely affected 

we lease substantially all of the properties on which we operate restaurants and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value which could involve substantial increases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals could adversely impact us if we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants conversely substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs reducing our restaurant margins 

  

 

  

risks unique to our business strategy 

we may not persuade consumers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food  

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade consumers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice restaurant segment we may not successfully educate consumers about the quality of our food and consumers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create additionally it may be more difficult for us to persuade the public about the quality and value of our food following any foodborne illnesses associated with our restaurants as further described above under “ risks related to our plans to grow our sales and profitability—we may continue to be negatively impacted by food safety incidents ” if consumers are not persuaded that we offer a good value for their money our restaurant transaction counts could be adversely affected which would negatively impact our business results 

our restructuring activities will increase our expenses may not be successful and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention 

during 2018 we opened a new headquarters office in newport beach california consolidated certain corporate administrative functions into our existing office in columbus ohio closed a corporate office in new york new york and commenced the closure of our previous headquarters office in denver colorado as a result of the foregoing actions we incurred corporate restructuring costs totaling 426 million in the second third and fourth quarters of 2018 and expect to incur additional corporate restructuring costs in 2019 aggregating approximately 5 million to 15 million we also closedrelocated 45 chipotle restaurants and five pizzeria locales throughout the country during 2018 and as a result we incurred restaurant exit costs of approximately 358 million in the second third and fourth quarters of 2018 and expect to incur additional restaurant exit costs in 2019 aggregating approximately 1 million to 7 million these expenses adversely impacted our results of operations during 2018 and reduced our cash position and will continue to adversely impact our results of operation and cash position additionally the amount of the restructuring expenses we expect to incur in 2019 as well as our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities are subject to assumptions and uncertainties there is no assurance that we will successfully implement or fully realize the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from these measures or if we incur charges or costs in amounts that are greater than anticipated our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we currently expect 

in addition the relocation of our headquarters office functions has necessitated that we hire and train a significant number of new employees to replace corporate support employees who did not continue with us as a result of the relocation hiring and training significant numbers of support team employees could distract existing employees decrease employee morale make it more difficult to retain and hire new talent and harm our reputation this turnover and any resulting distraction could negatively impact the overall performance of our corporate support teams resulting in inefficiencies higher short or longterm costs failures in risk management or compensating controls or decreased productivity in numerous support or administrative functions the costs associated with hiring new talent may also be more significant than we currently expect as a result of these or other similar risks our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our senior management team is new which may pose challenges and our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel  

brian niccol joined us as chief executive officer in march 2018 and we added a new chief marketing officer chris brandt and our first chief people officer marissa andrada in april 2018 added our first chief legal officer and general counsel roger theodoredis in october 2018 and added a new chief development officer tabassum zalotrawala in december 2018 these officers have in turn hired a substantial number of new direct reports and as a result our senior management team is relatively new and may face challenges working together as a unit aligning on strategic priorities and objectives or integrating their new teams with one another these challenges may be exacerbated by our ongoing restructuring efforts as further described above under “— our restructuring activities will increase our expenses may not be successful and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention ” our board of directors has experienced recent changes as well including the addition of mr niccol as well as our founder and former chief executive officer steve ells assuming the position of executive chairman and these changes may add to the challenges inherent in assimilating a new management team failure to meet these challenges successfully may adversely impact our operations business results or longterm growth prospects 

  

 

  

additionally jack hartung our chief financial officer has served with us since early in our company’s history and much of our growth as well as the development of our restaurant economic model has occurred under his direction curt garner who joined us as chief information officer in november 2015 has had a key role in developing and executing our digital and mobile ordering platforms and strategy and we believe these and other technology innovations will become increasingly important in helping us return to sales and profitability growth scott boatwright who joined us as chief restaurant officer in may 2017 has led our recent efforts to improve the guest experience in our restaurants which we also believe will be critical in attracting new and lapsed guests and laurie schalow who joined us as chief communications officer in august 2017 has been responsible for media relations efforts and other initiatives to improve public perceptions of our brand each of our executive officers is an atwill employee and any turnover among our executive officers may disrupt our progress in implementing our business strategies or otherwise negatively impact our growth prospects or future operating results additionally if our company culture or operations were to deteriorate following any additional changes in leadership we may be adversely impacted as well 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

the principle of food with integrity constitutes a significant part of our business strategy we use a substantial amount of ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on practices we believe to be more sustainable or responsible than some conventional practices and we try to make our food as fresh as we can we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity philosophy there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are more responsible farming practices as well as uncertainty regarding demand due to changing consumer perceptions economic trends and other factors many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area although all of our restaurants generally serve meat from animals raised in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we may experience shortages of meat meeting these criteria due to suppliers suspending production market conditions or other forces beyond our control for example in 2015 we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards and suspended purchases of pork from the supplier without this supply we did not have enough pork meeting our specifications for all of our restaurants and a large number of our restaurants were not serving carnitas for a number of months during 2015 which adversely impact ed sales we have experienced shortages of beef or chicken meeting our protocols on a periodic basis over the past several years as well resulting in our serving commodity beef and chicken which may have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of our brand 

if as a result of any of the factors described above we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of our preferred ingredients on a costeffective basis our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with our food with integrity philosophy which could make us less popular among our guests and cause sales to decline our commitment to the food with integrity philosophy may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our food with integrity approach any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could impact guest traffic at our restaurants and damage our brand we may also face adverse publicity or liability for false advertising claims if suppliers do not adhere to all of the elements of our food with integrity programs such as responsible meat protocols requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods our use of nongmo ingredients in our food and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions if any such supplier failures occur and are publicized our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted and our food with integrity message may result in consumers holding us to a higher standard in terms of food safety as well which may make it more difficult for us to recover from the foodborne illness incidents discussed elsewhere in this report as consumers who believe we failed to uphold our own standards may decline to return to our restaurants as frequently or at all 

additionally in response to increasing consumer awareness and demand some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones dairy products from cows not treated with rbgh and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our food with integrity philosophy if competitors become known for using these types of higherquality or more sustainable ingredients it could further limit our supply of these ingredients and may also make it more difficult for us to differentiate chipotle and our restaurants either which could adversely impact our operating results 

  

 

  

pizzeria locale and other new restaurant concepts may not contribute to our growth 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based – finding better ingredients preparing them using classic techniques in front of the guest and serving them in an interactive format with great teams dedicated to providing an excellent dining experience – can be adapted to cuisines other than the food served at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened a number of shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants beginning in 2011 and one tasty made burger restaurant in ohio in 2016 we also have a majority ownership interest in a company that until late 2018 operated seven fast casual pizzeria locale restaurants in denver colorado kansas city missouri and cincinnati ohio shophouse and tastymade were not able to achieve a level of sales and profitability that made them attractive to us for future investment and we recognized a 145 million noncash impairment charge representing substantially all of the value of longlived assets of shophouse during the year ended december 31 2016 and closed all of the shophouse locations in the first half of 2017 we closed tastymade in 2018 and also closed the five pizzeria locale restaurants outside of denver in 2018 as part of our program to close underperforming restaurants throughout the country furthermore pizzeria locale has significantly lower brand awareness lower sales and less operating experience than most chipotle restaurants and may also not achieve restaurant economics that make the concept attractive for further investment in the future there are also numerous competitors in the pizza market including a number of large and wellknown brands and a number of other companies or individuals in the restaurant industry have recently opened or invested in fastcasual pizza concepts 

notwithstanding our investment in pizzeria locale and exploration of other restaurant brand opportunities our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand as a result we do not expect pizzeria locale or other concepts to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years we may also determine not to move forward with any further expansion of pizzeria locale which may limit our overall growth potential over the long term conversely any expansion of pizzeria locale or investments in other restaurant concepts might distract our management which could have an adverse impact on our core chipotle business 

regulatory and legal risks 

governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs 

employment and immigration regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules healthcare laws scheduling notification requirements and antidiscrimination and antiharassment laws complying with these laws and regulations subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims of noncompliance for example a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee classification employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we incur legal costs to defend and we could suffer losses from these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant in addition several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases changes to eligibility for overtime pay paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes have increased our labor costs and may have a further negative impact on our labor costs in the future in addition in november 2017 the fair value workweek legislation was implemented in new york city which requires fast food employers to provide employees with specified notice in scheduling changes and pay premiums for changes made to employees’ schedules amongst other requirements similar legislation may be enacted in other jurisdictions in which we operate in as well and could result in increased labor costs changes in us healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses 

  

 

  

we also are required to comply with work authorization verification requirements unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees for example following an audit by the department of homeland security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota during 2010 we lost approximately 450 employees resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations including slower throughput as we trained new employees as well as some degree of negative publicity the resulting broadbased civil and criminal investigations by the us attorney for the district of columbia and us securities and exchange commission resulted in significant legal costs termination of a significant number of employees in specific markets or across our company due to work authorization or other regulatory issues would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees we could also become subject to fines penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws we use the “everify” program an internetbased free program run by the us government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company however use of everify does not guarantee that we will successfully identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment on the other hand in the event we erroneously reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants we could be found to be in violation of antidiscrimination laws our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors furthermore immigration laws have been an area of considerable political focus in recent years and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs further changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and potential liability and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees 

additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize our employees and those of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired potential changes in labor laws including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture 

privacycybersecurity 

we are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about guests as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is evolving and increasingly demanding significant new privacy regulation in the european union is further described above under “ — risks related to our plans to improve our sales and profitability and restore our economic model — our expansion into international markets has been limited and may present increased risks due to lower consumer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors ” at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of guest or employee information on our behalf if our security and information systems or those of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information or those of our delivery partners are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees additional risks related to cybersecurity are described below under “ — general business riskswe may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential guest and employee information” 

americans with disabilities act and similar state laws 

we are subject to the ada and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we have incurred substantial legal fees in connection with adarelated complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws the expenses associated with these modifications or any damages legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ada or similar state laws could be material 

  

 

  

nutrition and food regulation 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards and make other nutritional information available went in place across the us in may 2018 and states and localities have also proposed or adopted regulation of or taxes on certain beverage products kids’ meals and other food products or practices these requirements may increase our expenses change guest buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales or subject us to liability if we make errors in complying with the requirements 

local licensure zoning and other regulation 

each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

environmental laws 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the use of straws utensils and the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants restrictions on the use of certain materials in our restaurants may subject us to increased costs for paper packaging and other nonfood items in addition although we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations investigations of some of our properties has identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations while we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then we could be held liable under certain environmental laws as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

healthcare regulation 

we offer eligible fulltime and parttime us employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us for various reasons many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans under the comprehensive us health care reform law enacted in 2010 the affordable care act employers can be subjected to penalties for failure to provide a healthcare plan which is deemed to be both “affordable” and offers minimal essential coverage we have incurred fines associated with this regulation in the past and future costs associated with these healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty but may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

other aspects of regulatory risk 

from time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various laws and regulations that cover our business much of this litigation occurs in california even though currently only about 17 of our restaurants are located there as we continue to expand in california or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in california our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in or minimized our operations in california 

because we do not franchise the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business as described above may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

  

 

  

regulatory actions and litigation related to food safety incidents that impacted us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 may adversely impact us 

we are facing an ongoing government investigation into food safety incidents and related compliance measures as described in note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we also have received numerous claims from guests who were or claim to have been impacted by food safety incidents associated with our restaurants and a number of those claimants have filed lawsuits against us we are cooperating in the government investigation and with many of the guests impacted by these incidents but will continue to incur significant legal and other costs in doing so we have also been sued in two separate shareholder class action lawsuits in connection with declines in our stock price in the wake of food safety incidents and defending these lawsuits may subject us to significant additional legal expenses additionally the liabilities from guest claims and related litigation expenses may be greater than we anticipate due to the uncertainties inherent in litigation all of these costs liabilities and expenses will negatively impact our operating results moreover publicity regarding any legal proceedings related to food safety incidents may heighten consumer awareness of our past food safety incidents or otherwise negatively impact perceptions of our brand which may hamper our ability to increase our sales 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

we’re subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters including wages work hours overtime vacation and family leave discrimination wrongful termination and similar matters and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future our guests also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we’re responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices see “— governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs ” above for additional discussion of these types of claims from time to time we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products and other disclosure and advertising practices we have been subject to a number of these actions and may be subject to additional actions of this type in the future we are also undergoing government investigations and have been sued in two shareholder class action lawsuits each as described elsewhere in this report including in note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and these matters may be particularly expensive to defend andor resolve 

we believe the number of many of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers particularly in california regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we’re ultimately held liable for such claims they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations whether directed at us or at fast casual or quickservice restaurants generally may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects which in turn could adversely affect our results 

general business risks 

we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential guest and employee information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2018  approximately 76 of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen including a number of highly publicized incidents with wellknown retailers in recent years 

in april 2017 our information security team detected unauthorized activity on the network that supports payment processing for our restaurants and the ensuing investigation detected malware designed to access payment card data from cards used at pointofsale devices at most of our restaurants primarily in the period from march 24 2017 through april 18 2017 we removed the malware from our systems and continue to work to enhance our security measures including a planned implementation of new payment processing technology in substantially all of our restaurants during 2019 however we expect to be subject to payment card network assessments and may incur regulatory fines or penalties for which our insurance coverage is limited and as a result we recorded a 30 million estimated liability of which approximately 29 million remained in accrued liabilities as of december 31 2018 we may ultimately be subject to liabilities greater than or less than the amount accrued see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion of potential liabilities and pending litigation filed against us in connection with this incident 

  

 

  

we may be subject to additional lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to the 2017 incident or any future incidents in which payment card data may have been compromised proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

we also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about guests as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding for example a new privacy regulation in the european union called gdpr became effective in may 2018 and requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue similarly the california consumer privacy act is due to take effect january 1 2020  and will require our instituting additional new processes and protections 

at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of guest or employee information on our behalf we have seen an increase over the past several years in the frequency and sophistication of attempts to compromise the security of several of these systems if the security and information systems that we or our outsourced third party providers use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected by these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees 

if we experience a significant failure in or interruption of certain key information technology systems our business could be adversely impacted 

we use a variety of applications and systems to securely manage the flow of information within each of our restaurants as well as our centralized corporate infrastructure and to administer a number of significant business functions the services available within our systems and applications include restaurant operations supply chain inventory scheduling training human capital management financial tools and data protection services our restaurant it structure is based primarily on a pointofsale system that operates locally at the restaurant and is integrated with other functions necessary to restaurant operations the pointofsale system records sales transactions receives out of store orders and authorizes batches and transmits credit card transactions it also allows employees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant is collected in the central corporate infrastructure which enables management to continually monitor operating results our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systems and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our pointofsale system and related networks and applications  

these systems may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches viruses and other disruptive problems as well as from physical theft fire power loss telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events any failure of these systems to operate effectively whether from security breaches maintenance problems upgrades or transitions to new platforms or other factors could result in interruptions to or delays in our restaurant or other operations adversely impacting the restaurant experience for our guests or negatively impacting our ability to manage our business we plan major hardware upgrades and systems implementations during 2019 that will encompass all of our restaurants which may increase the likelihood of a systems outage or malfunction negatively impacting our business if our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected in addition remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

  

 

  

negative publicity relating to our restaurants or our company could adversely impact our reputation which may significantly harm us 

we depend significantly on consumers’ perception of and connection to our brand in addition to the damage to our reputation from wellpublicized food safety incidents as described elsewhere in this report we may experience negative publicity from time to time relating to food quality guest complaints restaurant facilities advertising and other business practices litigation alleging injuries or improper employee practices government investigations or other regulatory issues our suppliers’ potential failure to adhere to elements of our food with integrity protocols other issues regarding the integrity of our suppliers’ food processing employee relationships guest or employee data breaches or other matters regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held to be responsible the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one or more restaurants or any of the foregoing topics may extend far beyond the restaurants involved and affect many more or even all of our restaurants the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated a similar risk exists with respect to unrelated food service businesses if consumers associate those businesses with our own operations and even publicity that could reasonably be viewed as positive may have adverse consequences on our business for example positive developments in regard to the food safety issues that have impacted us might have the effect of continuing or increasing consumer awareness of the issue 

the adverse impact of negative publicity on consumers’ perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales if the impact of any such publicity is particularly longlasting the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished additionally negative publicity about our employment practices may affect our reputation among employees and potential employees which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain top performing employees that could adversely impact the quality of the guest experience we can offer and our operations generally and may increase our labor costs as well 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

there has been a widespread and dramatic increase in the use of social media platforms that allow users to access a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons the availability of information on social media can be virtually immediate as can its impact and users of many social media platforms can post information without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted adverse information concerning our restaurants or brand whether accurate or inaccurate may be posted on such platforms at any time and can quickly reach a wide audience the resulting harm to our reputation may be immediate without affording us an opportunity to correct or otherwise respond to the information and it is challenging to monitor and anticipate developments on social media in order to respond in an effective and timely manner as a result social media may exacerbate the risks described above under “— negative publicity relating to our restaurants or our company could adversely impact our reputation which may significantly harm us ” 

in addition although search engine marketing social media and other new technological platforms offer great opportunities to increase awareness of and engagement with our restaurants and brand our failure to use social media effectively in our marketing efforts may further expose us to the risks associated with the accelerated impact of social media many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and the social media landscape is rapidly evolving potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance and we may not do so effectively a variety of additional risks associated with our use of social media include the possibility of improper disclosure of proprietary information exposure of personally identifiable information of our employees or guests fraud or the publication of outofdate information any of which may result in material liabilities or reputational damage furthermore any inappropriate use of social media platforms by our employees could also result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation or lead to litigation that increases our costs 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health workers’ compensation general liability property damage and auto liability we are selfinsured for our employee health plans but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for workers’ compensation general liability property damage employment practices liability and auto liability insurance 

  

 

  

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is relatively short and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations it is also possible that losses covered under one or more of our insurance policies may exceed the applicable policy limits and any such uninsured losses could be significant enough to have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos our food with integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property whether in print on the internet or in other media the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors because of factors including 

• changes in comparable restaurant sales and guest visits including as a result of perceptions about our brand competition changes in consumer confidence or discretionary spending and other factors listed in th is   “ risk factors ” section  

• additional negative publicity about the occurrence of foodborne illnesses the ingredients we use or other problems at our restaurants whether as a result of actions within our control or those outside of our control such as those by our delivery partners  

• fluctuations in supply costs particularly for our most significant food items 

• labor availability and wages of restaurant management and crew as well as temporary fluctuations in labor costs as a result of operational changes or other factors 

• increases in marketing or promotional expenses as we introduce new marketing programs and strategies or increases   pending on existing marketing programs in an effort to drive sales 

• our ability to raise menu prices without adversely impacting guest traffic particularly if food and labor costs were to increase 

• the timing of new restaurant openings and related revenues and expenses 

• operating costs at newly opened restaurants which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation 

• the impact of inclement weather natural disasters and other calamities such as freezes that have impacted produce crops and droughts that have impacted livestock and the supply of certain meats 

• litigation settlement costs and related legal expense 

• tax expenses impairment charges and nonoperating costs 

• variations in general economic conditions including the impact of declining interest rates on our interest income 

• increases in infrastructure costs and 

  

 

  

• potential distraction or unusual expenses associated with our expansion into international markets or initiatives to expand new concepts 

﻿ 

seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading days—that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

﻿ 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall this risk may continue to be a greater concern during 2019 as analyst and investor expectations for continued improvements in our business results may be higher than the level of results we actually achieve 

additionally we believe the market price of our common stock which has generally traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most of our peer companies has typically reflected high market expectations for our future operating results the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times as well including during the recent past as a result of adverse publicity events as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our b oard of d irectors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the b oard of d irectors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders which could adversely affect the price of our common stock

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion together with item 6 “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the discussion contains forwardlooking statements involving risks uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations see “cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements” factors that might cause such differences include those described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

overview 

as of december 31 2018 we operated 2452 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states 37 international chipotle restaurants and two nonchipotle restaurants we are committed to making our food more accessible to everyone while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose 

2018 financial and operational highlights   

sales trends average restaurant sales were 2004 million for the year ended december 31 2018 an increase from 1940 million for the year ended december 30 2017 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months 

comparable restaurant sales increased 40 for the full year 2018 and increased 61 which included a 2 increase in comparable restaurant transactions for the three months ended december 31 2018 comparable restaurant sales and comparable restaurant transactions represent the change in periodoverperiod sales or paid transactions for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months we expect our full year 2019 comparable restaurant sales increases to be in the midsingle digit range 

we continue to invest in improving our digital platforms and equipping select restaurants with an upgraded second make line dedicated to fulfilling outofrestaurant orders sales from outofrestaurant orders including delivery orders increased 260 basis points to 109 of revenue for the full year 2018 an increase from 83 of revenue for the full year 2017 

restaurant operating costs during the full year 2018 our restaurant operating costs food beverage and packaging labor occupancy and other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased 180 basis points to 813 compared to the full year 2017 the decrease was primarily due to comparable restaurant sales increases combined with lower marketing and promotional expenses partially offset by wage inflation at the crew level 

corporate restructuring during 2018 we opened a new headquarters office in newport beach california consolidated certain corporate administrative functions into our existing office in columbus ohio closed a corporate office in new york new york and commenced the closure of our previous headquarters office in denver colorado all affected employees were either offered an opportunity to continue in the new organization or were offered a severance package we expect to incur total corporate restructuring costs including costs already incurred aggregating approximately 48 million to 58 million including i employee severance and other employee transition costs of approximately 8 million to 10 million ii recruitment and relocation costs of approximately 12 million to 14 million iii lease termination and other office closure costs of approximately 17 million to 22 million and iv thirdparty and other costs of approximately 11 million to 12 million we recognized a total of 426 million of the foregoing costs during 2018 and expect to incur additional corporate restructuring costs into 2019 aggregating approximately 5 million to 15 million for additional information please see note 5 “corporate restructuring costs” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” as well as “ risks unique to our business strategy — our restructuring activities will increase our expenses may not be successful and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

restaurant closures  in june 2018 we announced planned restaurant closures of approximately 55 to 65 restaurants beginning in the second quarter of 2018 and continuing over the next several quarters during the twelve months ended december 31 2018 we closed or relocated 45 chipotle restaurants and five pizzeria locale restaurants in connection with this initiative we expect to incur total restaurant exit costs inclusive of costs already incurred aggregating approximately 37 million to 43 million we recognized restaurant exit costs of approximately 358 million during 2018 and expect to incur additional restaurant exit costs into 2019 aggregating approximately 1 million to 7 million for additional information please see note 6 “restaurant closure costs and impairment of longlived assets” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ”  as well as “ risks unique to our business strategy — our restructuring activities will increase our expenses may not be successful and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

restaurant development for the full year 2018 we opened 137 new restaurants we expect 2019 openings will be approximately 140 to 155 with a heavier weighting of openings towards the second half of the year 

  

 

  

management enhancements  brian niccol joined us as chief executive officer and as a member of the board in march 2018 added a new chief marketing officer chris brandt and our first chief people officer marissa andrada in april 2018 added our first chief legal officer and general counsel roger theodoredis in october 2018 and added a new chief development officer tabassum zalotrawala in december 2018

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 



﻿ 

results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our aggregate restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization generally increase 

revenue 



﻿ 

the significant factors contributing to the increase in revenue in 2018 were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed 2374 million to the revenue increase of which 1121 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2018 and comparable restaurant sales increased 1512 million the increase in comparable restaurant sales was attributable to an increase in average check including a 40 benefit from menu price increases partially offset by 0 8 fewer comparable restaurant transactions 

the significant factors contributing to the increase in revenue in 2017 were comparable restaurant sales increases and new restaurant openings revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed 3388 million to the revenue increase of which 1491 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2017 and comparable restaurant sales increased 2332 million the increase in comparable restaurant sales was attributable to an increase in average check including a 12 benefit from menu price increases 

food beverage and packaging costs   



﻿ 

food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2018 primarily due to the benefit of menu price increases taken in select restaurants in 2017 and again at the end of 2018 food beverage and packaging costs also benefitted from favorable avocado prices these decreases were partially offset by increased freight costs and to a lesser extent increased costs for tortillas and rice 

  

 

  

food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 primarily due to the benefit of menu price increases taken in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 food beverage and packaging costs also benefitted from bringing the preparation of lettuce and bell peppers back into our restaurants after using precut produce during portions of 2016 and cost savings initiatives resulting in lower prices and usage of paper and packaging products these decreases were partially offset by higher avocado prices 

labor costs   



﻿ 

labor costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2018 primarily due to an increase in wage inflation the increase was partially offset by sales leverage as our revenues increased 87 in 2018 which included the benefit of menu price increases 

labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased during 2017 due primarily to increased crew efficiency including the benefit of lower promotional activity during the year improved manager deployment and sales leverage including the impact of menu price increases the decrease was partially offset by wage inflation 

occupancy costs   



﻿ 

occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2018 and 2017 primarily due to sales leverage on a largely fixedcost base 

other operating costs   



﻿ 

other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs bank and credit card processing fees and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2018 due primarily to sales leverage including the benefit of menu price increases and to a lesser extent marketing and promotional spend decreasing from 35 of revenue in 2017 to 29 of revenue in 2018 this is partially offset by increased costs associated with store repairs and maintenance and delivery 

other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 due primarily to decreased marketing and promotional spend sales leverage including the benefit of menu price increases and decreased kitchen supplies expense marketing and promotional spend decreased to 35 of revenue in 2017 as compared to 51 of revenue in 2016 

general and administrative expenses   



﻿ 

  

 

  

general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms in 2018 due to 32 1 million related to the corporate restructuring and other unusual charges 214 million related to higher costs associated with our annual incentive cash bonus program and retention bonuses 109 million associated with the biennial all managers’ conference that was held in september 2018 38 million in higher stock compensation expense and the remaining increase primarily relates to general and administrative growth to support our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience these increases were partially offset by the benefit of comparing against a nonrecurring charge of 300 million recorded in the third quarter of 2017 related to the data security incident in the second quarter of 2017  

general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms in 2017 due to the liability of 300 million for the data security incident that occurred in 2017 increased bonus costs and higher noncash stockbased compensation expense of 118 million the increase was partially offset by a decrease of 105 million in legal expenses and decreased meeting costs of 91 million primarily because of the biennial all managers conference held in september 2016 the increase in stockbased compensation expense during 2017 was primarily a result of a cumulative reduction of expense in 2016 for performance share awards that were no longer expected to vest 

depreciation and amortization   



﻿ 

depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue in 2018 due primarily to accelerated depreciation on certain restaurant assets in connection with a large restaurant refresh project and from the restaurant closures described above under “2018 financial and operating highlights—restaurant closures” 

depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 due to sales leverage on a partially fixedcost base 

loss on disposal and impairment of assets 



﻿ 

impairment closure costs and asset disposals increased in dollar terms in 2018 primarily due to the planned closures of underperforming restaurants that began in the second quarter of 2018 offices affected by corporate restructuring and the write down of a large portion of the associated longlived asset values which are discussed above under “2018 financial and operational highlights—corporate restructuring” and “—restaurant closures” 

impairment closure costs and asset disposals during 2017 consisted primarily of charges related to the closure of underperforming chipotle restaurants and the replacement of certain kitchen equipment this was a decrease from the prior year due to the closing of all shophouse restaurants in 2016 

income tax provision 



﻿ 

the 2018 annual effective tax rate was lower than the 2017 rate primarily due to the favorable impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act that was enacted in december 2017 and federal tax credits offset by unfavorable tax impacts of expirations and cancellations of various equity awards 

  

 

  

the 2017 annual effective tax rate was lower than the 2016 rate due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act resulting in our recording a benefit for the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability as well as from a lower state tax rate the decrease in our effective tax rate was partially offset by federal credits on overall higher pretax operating income 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2018 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 



﻿ 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales are lower and net income has generally been lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases or promotional activities and other marketing initiatives the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results although on an overall annual basis changes in trading days do not have a significant impact 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter the amount and timing of non cash stockbased compensation expense and anticipated and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity which we use to finance new restaurant construction initiatives to improve the guest experience in our restaurants working capital and general corporate needs as of december 31 2018 we had a cash and cash equivalent and shortterm investment balance of 6768 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business to invest in maintain and refurbish our existing restaurants to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions and for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2018 there was 576 million remaining available under previouslyannounced stock repurchase authorizations approved by our board of directors we announced 100 million in additional repurchase authorizations in february 2019 under the repurchase authorizations shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions subject to market conditions we believe that cash from operations together with our cash and investment balances will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 

we have not required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

  

 

  

our total capital expenditures for 2018 were 2874 million in 2018 we spent on average about 09 million in development and construction costs per new restaurant or about 08 million net of landlord reimbursements of 01 million in 2019 we expect to incur about 300 million in total capital expenditures we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to consist of investments in existing restaurants including remodeling and similar improvements and upgrading our second make lines and other restaurant equipment we also expect about 130 million in capital expenditures related to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements for new restaurants to be opened in 2019 we anticipate average development costs will increase due to strategic initiatives planned in new restaurants such as a pickup lane and an upgraded second make line finally we expect a portion of our capital expenditures for the year to be incurred for additional corporate initiatives 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018 were as follows 



﻿ 





﻿ 

the above table does not include income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments additionally we have excluded our estimated loss contingencies including the accrued liability related to the data security incident described elsewhere due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of payment see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018 and 2017 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor healthcare costs fuel utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level additionally many of our leases require us to pay property taxes maintenance and utilities all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases there have been and there may be in the future delays in implementing such menu price increases if we do raise menu prices in the future general competitive pressures or negative consumer responses may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe that of our critical accounting estimates the following involve a higher degree of judgement and subjectivity 

  

 

  

leases 

we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straightline basis over the reasonably assured lease term in addition tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recognized when earned and recorded in deferred rent and amortized as reductions of rent expense over the reasonably assured lease term the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

we record a liability for lease termination costs consisting of the net present value of remaining lease obligations net of estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained at the date we cease using a property and measure fair value using level 3 inputs unobservable inputs based on a discounted cash flow method any subsequent adjustments to that liability as a result of lease termination or changes in estimates of sublease income are recorded in the period incurred if the estimate of sublease income was changed our lease termination expenses could differ materially 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets to be held and used for potential impairment assets are grouped together at the market level or in the case of a potential relocation or closure at the restaurant level we manage our restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities as such an individual restaurant’s cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market 

the fair value measurement for asset impairment is based on level 3 inputs we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value the estimated fair value of the asset is generally determined using a discounted cash flow projection model in certain cases management uses other market information when available to estimate the fair value of an asset the impairment charges represent the excess of each asset’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value we make significant judgments to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on internal projections and knowledge of our operations historical performance and trends in sales and restaurant operating costs and can be significantly impacted by changes in our business or economic conditions the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment and utilizes valuation techniques including discounting estimated future cash flows and marketbased analyses to determine resale value if our estimates or underlying assumptions including discount rate change in the future our operating results may be materially impacted 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights or sosars and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards and sosars with performancebased vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different certain awards that contain service performance and market conditions have vesting criteria based on chipotle’s relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in annual average revenue growth net income growth and total shareholder return our estimates of chipotle’s future performance and the future perfo rmance of the restaurant industry peer group are assumptions that involve a high degree of subjectivity if we had arrived at different assumptions for revenue growth or net income for chipotle or the peer group our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different   

  

 

  

insurance liability 

we are selfinsured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers’ compensation general liability employee health property and auto damage predetermined loss limits have been arranged with third party insurance companies to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business we record an accrual for legal contingencies when we determine that it is probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes requires the use of estimates in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items including impacts on effective tax rates deferred tax items and valuation allowances based on our management’s interpretation and application of complex tax laws and accounting guidance we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the measurement and recognition of the item while we believe that our reserves are adequate issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related reserve and could materially increase or decrease our income tax provision in the current andor future periods 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

commodity price risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials and utilities to run our restaurants are ingredients or commodities that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices and range forward protocols under which we agree on a price range for the duration of that protocol however a majority of the dollar value of our purchases is effectively at spot prices generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 36 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where practical the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance 

changing interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2018 we had 6507 million in investments and interestbearing cash accounts including insurancerelated restricted trust accounts classified in restricted cash and 353 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest and other income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 22 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date

 item 1  business 

general 

chipotle mexican grill inc a delaware corporation together with its subsidiaries “chipotle” “we” “us” or “our” operates chipotle mexican grill restaurants which serve a focused menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads made using fresh ingredients as of december 31 2017 we operated 2363 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states as well as 37 international chipotle restaurants and we also had eight nonchipotle restaurants we focus on finding fresh highquality raw ingredients to make great tasting food prepared using classic cooking methods on building strong restaurant teams that are centered on providing an excellent guest experience on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with the highest regard for the safety of our customers and with a continuing awareness of and respect for the environment we have grown substantially over the past five years and expect to open between 130 and 150 new restaurants in 2018 representing a slight reduction in our rate of new openings as we focus our resources on improving our operations and delivering an outstanding experience to every one of our guests 

throughout our history we have pursued a mission to change the way people think about and eat fast food the fast food landscape has changed dramatically over chipotle’s 24year history suggesting that we may have achieved this mission with a number of concepts built using service and sourcing formats that closely resemble ours – with more selective sourcing food prepared onsite and a service model that allows customers to choose exactly what they eat looking at what we have accomplished we have reenvisioned our purpose and are working to cultivate nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day  we are also aiming to simplify our business focus to emphasize only those things that result in an excellent guest experience in our restaurants 

we transitioned the management of our restaurants from eleven to nine regions during the fourth quarter of 2017 and we aggregate our operations into one reportable segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 and our total assets as of december 31 2017 and 2016 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the us for a discussion of risks related to our international 

 

operations see “ risks related to our plans to improve our sales and profitability and restore our economic model – our expansion into international markets   has been limited and may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand… ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

our focus on safe and delicious food made with better ingredients 

focused menu chipotle restaurants feature only a few entrée items burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats tofu two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole queso shredded cheese and lettuce there is enough variety to extend our menu to provide thousands of choices in preparing our food we employ classic cooking methods and use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice our restaurants do not have microwaves or freezers ingredients we use include chicken steak carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy braised and shredded beef sofritas organic braised tofu and vegetarian pinto and black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice freshly chopped cilantro and a pinch of salt as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions to our entrees depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also serve tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime juice and salt with sides of guacamole salsas or queso in addition to sodas fruit and tea drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch some in our restaurants and some with the same fresh ingredients in larger batches in commissaries 

wholesome food serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our purpose so that guests can enjoy wholesome food every day we insist on preparing cooking and serving nutritious food made from natural ingredients and animals that are raised or grown with care and with respect for the environment we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on the sources of each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve the food we serve were all about simple fresh food without the use of artificial colors or flavors typically found in fast food—just genuine raw ingredients and their individual delectable flavors 

in all of our chipotle restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised in accordance with criteria we have established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare and without the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones we brand these meats as “responsibly raised ® ” one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to serve meats raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so for example some of our restaurants periodically serve conventionally raised chicken or beef from time to time due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised brand meats in the future more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats or stop serving one or more menu items due to additional supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

we also seek to use more responsibly grown produce by which we mean produce grown by suppliers whose practices conform to our priorities with respect to environmental considerations and employee welfare most of the beans we serve are organically grown or grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown a portion of some of the other produce items we serve is organically grown as well our commitment to better ingredients also extends to the dairy products we serve in 2017 all of the sour cream and shredded cheese served in our us chipotle restaurants was made with milk that comes from cows not given rbgh recombinant bovine growth hormone and sourced from pasturebased dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows 

in addition none of the ingredients in our food not including beverages in us chipotle restaurants   contain genetically modified organisms or gmos while the meat and poultry we serve is not genetically modified the animals are likely fed a diet of grains containing gmos due to the prevalence of gmos in a number of important feed crops the vast majority of the grains used as animal feed in the us are genetically modified additionally some of the beverages we serve are sweetened with corn based sweeteners which are typically made with genetically modified corn 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality and safety we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our 24 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and the suppliers’ understanding of our mission we work closely with our suppliers and seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols and our distribution centers purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers we’ve also tried to increase where practical the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages and we follow industry news trade tariffs and other issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world 

 

events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas are purchased from a small number of suppliers for a discussion of risks related to our supply chain see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry –   failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations” and “ risks related to our unique business strategy –   our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks” in item 1a “risk factors”     

quality assurance and food safe ty we are committed to serving safe high quality food our executive director of food safety a respected expert in the industry oversees our food safety programs and practices components of which include 

﻿ 



﻿ 

these and other food safety practices underscore our commitment to becoming a leader in food safety while we continue to serve high quality food that our customers love our executive director of food safety directs a quality assurance department that establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs and works closely with our suppliers to ensure our high standards are met throughout the supply chain we maintain a limited list of approved suppliers many of which are among the top suppliers in the industry in addition our training operations and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness employee health protocols and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also intended to ensure that we not only continue to comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations but establish chipotle as an industry leader in food safety 

to be sure that our food safety programs continue to evolve in ways that will help maintain leadership in this important area we have a food safety advisory council comprised of some of the nation’s foremost food safety authorities the food safety advisory council is charged with evaluating our programs both in practice and implementation and advising us on ways to elevate our already high standards for food safety 

delivering an excellent guest experience 

we believe there is nothing more important than treating our guests to an excellent experience every time they visit one of our restaurants and expect that doing so will help us attract customers more frequently and engender greater customer loyalty we have also renewed our commitment to focusing on our restaurant operations and training to elevate the experience we are providing and ensuring greater consistency throughout all of our restaurants creating an excellent guest experience starts with hiring great people creating great teams and training them on our high standards we have retooled our restaurant compensation systems to place greater emphasis on the strength of operations and the guest experience and revamped our training programs to better support these priorities 

restaurant team each restaurant typically has a general manager or restaurateur a highperforming general manager an apprentice manager in a majority of our restaurants and we aim to have two or three hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 22 full and parttime crew members though our busier restaurants tend to have slightly more employees we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we also crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our general managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes field leaders and team directors as well as executive team directors who report to our chief restaurant officer 

innovation  we are prioritizing the development of technological and other innovations such as digitalmobile ordering platforms and delivery and catering choices that allow our guests to engage with us in whatever fashion is most convenient for them by allowing our customers to order and receive their food in a variety of ways we believe we can attract more customers and encourage customers to choose us more frequently in order to successfully deliver a great experience for more customers we are 

 

emphasizing the optimization of second make lines and expanding the ability to pay using apple pay or android pay these initiatives allow us to fulfill catering or online orders without disrupting throughput on our main service line in fact technological innovations can enhance the experience of other guests by helping to improve throughput for those who choose to dine in our restaurants recent digital ordering innovations have allowed us to increase digital order volumes to the highest levels we’ve ever achieved and we believe continued improvements in these areas will allow us to achieve even better results additionally we have enhanced our data capabilities to allow us to better identify individual customers and their unique frequency patterns and to target our marketing and promotional efforts at the individual level we believe the advancements we have made in this area will help us as we continue to target lapsed customers and seek to build frequency among newer customers 

marketing 

our marketing program is divided into three categories topofmind advertising brand advertising and local marketing each of these serves a different purpose but together they are intended to differentiate us from the competition topofmind advertising is intended to keep current and new customers coming into our restaurants brand advertising is directed at existing customers and seeks to build deeper connections to our brand and local advertising aims to help connect our restaurants to local communities and the customers who live there 

our topofmind advertising has generally included print outdoor social digital and radio advertising but we have also incorporate d some national television advertising beyond these traditional channels we continue to pioneer new avenues of brand advertising aimed at making consumers more curious about some of the issues that are important to us and explaining why and how we are working to drive positive change in the nation’s food supply we also have a dedicated team of field marketing staff that helps connect our restaurants to local communities through fundraisers sponsorships and participation in local events 

alongside our restaurant teams these efforts have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity as our customers learn more about us and share with others this approach allows us to build awareness and loyalty with relatively low advertising expenditures even in a competitive category and to differentiate chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right thing in every facet of our business 

for a discussion of risks related to our marketing see “ risks related to our plans to improve our sales and profitability and restore our economic model – our marketing and advertising strategies may not be successful or may pose risks that could adversely impact our business ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

competition 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location brand reputation and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locallyowned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout online catering and delivery services among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally in recent years competition has increased significantly from restaurant formats like ours that serve higher quality food quickly and at a reasonable price 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who seek higherquality food as well as from convenience stores cafeterias and other dining outlets meal kit delivery companies and other eatathome options also present some degree of competition for our restaurants 

we believe that this competition has made it more challenging to maintain or increase the frequency of customer visits but continue to believe that we can differentiate ourselves with our purpose to cultivate nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day for more information see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry—competition could adversely affect us ” in item 1a “risk factors” we also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees 

restaurant site selection   

we believe restaurant site selection is critical to our success and growth strategy and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential restaurant location our site selection process is led by our internal team of real estate managers and also includes the use of external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets as well as support from an internal real estate strategy and research group we study the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and 

 

available information on competitors and other restaurants based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment for each potential restaurant site we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as inline or endcap locations in strip or power centers in regional malls and downtown business districts freestanding buildings food courts outlet centers airports military bases and train stations 

for a discussion of risks related to our expansion into new real estate types see “ risks related to our plans to improve our sales and profitability and restore our economic model – our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

other restaurant concepts 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based – finding better ingredients preparing them using classic techniques in front of the customer and serving them in an interactive format with great teams dedicated to providing an excellent dining experience – can be adapted to cuisines other than the food served at chipotle over the previous six years we’ve explored this idea by investing in innovative concepts such as pizzeria locale a fastcasual pizza restaurant that now has seven restaurants in four states and tasty made a burger restaurant we opened in lancaster ohio we also previously operated shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants but closed all of the shophouse locations in early 2017 in 2018 our focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand 

information systems   

we use a variety of applications and systems to securely manage the flow of information within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure the services available within our systems and applications include restaurant operations supply chain inventory scheduling training human capital management financial tools and data protection services the restaurant structure is based primarily on a pointofsale system that operates locally at the restaurant and is integrated with other functions necessary to restaurant operations it records sales transactions receives out of store orders and authorizes batches and transmits credit card transactions the system also allows employees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of   management reports select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant is collected in the c entral corporate infrastructure which enables management to continually monitor operating results our digital ordering system allows guests to place orders online or through our mobile app orders taken remotely are routed to the pointofsales system based on the time of customer order pickup we also continue to modernize and make investments in our information technology networks and infrastructure specifically in our physical and technological security measures to anticipate cyberattacks and prevent breaches and to provide improved control security and scalability enhancing the security of our financial data customer information and other personal information remains a priority for us 

in april 2017 our information security team detected unauthorized activity on the network that supports payment processing for our restaurants and immediately began an investigation with the help of leading computer security firms the investigation detected malware designed to access payment card data from cards used at the pointofsale system at most of our restaurants the malware searched for track data which may include cardholder name card number expiration date and internal verification codes however no other customer information was affected we removed the malware from our systems and have been working to further enhance the security of our payment card network

 item 1a  

risk factors 

tableend

the following risk factors could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating our business or making an investment decision involving our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies including overall economic and industry conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material also may materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our plans to improve our sales and profitability and restore our economic model 

our average restaurant sales and profitability will continue to fall short of our past results unless we can significantly increase comparable restaurant sales and there are material risks to our ability to do so 

in 2016 we experienced lower total company sales than the preceding year for the first time in our history as a public company and our average restaurant volumes declined from 2532 million as of september 30 2015 to 1940 million as of december 31 2017 to build our average restaurant sales we will need to increase comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation changes in comparable restaurant sales are a critical factor affecting our profitability because the profit margin on incremental comparable restaurant sales is generally higher due to the sales increases being applied against a partially fixed cost base conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales as we have seen in some periods over the past two years have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases while we continue to incur a certain level of fixed costs 

our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

﻿ 



﻿ 

these factors most of which are described in more detail in additional risk factors below are beyond our control to at least some degree as a result it is possible that we will experience future declines in comparable restaurant sales or that we otherwise will not achieve our targeted or expected comparable restaurant sales any future declines in comparable restaurant sales or failure to meet 

 

market expectations for comparable restaurant sales increases would likely result in a significant adverse impact on the price of our common stock   

increasing our sales and profits depends in part on our ability to open new restaurants in sites and on terms attractive to us which is subject to many unpredictable factors and we plan to open fewer restaurants in 2018 than we have in prior years which will adversely impact our sales growth 

we had 2408 restaurants in operation as of december 31 2017 and we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in 2018 we plan to open between 130 and 150 new restaurants significantly fewer than in prior years we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any one or more of the following factors 

﻿ 



﻿ 

one of our biggest challenges in opening new restaurants is staffing and training new restaurant teams we seek to hire only top performing employees train them extensively in order to ensure we provide an outstanding customer experience and promote many general managers from our crew all of which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs… ” 

another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for restaurant sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors could negatively impact our ability to manage our occupancy costs which may adversely impact our profitability in addition any of these factors may be exacerbated by economic factors which may result in developers and contractors seeing increased demand and therefore driving our construction and leasing costs up 

if we are unable to open the number of new restaurants we plan or if we decide to continue opening fewer new restaurants than we have in past years or delay or forego a significant number of planned restaurant openings including due to any of the reasons set forth above this could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our existing restaurant base will decline making it increasingly difficult to achieve levels of sales and profitability growth that we achieved prior to 2016 we expect this effect to be more pronounced through at least 2018 given our plan to decrease the number of new restaurants we open during the year as compared to years past 

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods   

 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generate sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize after the restaurant has built a customer base and during which costs may be higher as we train new employees and adjust our food deliveries and preparation to sales volumes and peakhour trends if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have results similar to those of our existing restaurants and may not be profitable our new restaurant sales volumes since the fourth quarter of 2015 have also been negatively impacted by the food safety issues described elsewhere in this report and other adverse publicity and as a result the effect of new restaurants on our average restaurant sales over the past two years has been of greater magnitude than we have seen in the past this trend may continue into 2018 and beyond 

we have also opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market and could limit our growth potential if we determine that one or more of our nearby restaurants makes an otherwise viable new restaurant site unattractive to us 

in addition in the event we are not able to contain increases in our average restaurant development costs which could result from inflation an increase in the proportion of higher cost locations project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in lower returns on our investment in new restaurants 

finally our new restaurant development activity has broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or types of restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and restaurants in airports food courts or on military sites these types of sites may become more important to our restaurant growth strategy as we find fewer opportunities to open in traditional sites given our past growth many of these site types may involve additional costs that we do not incur in our more traditional restaurant sites which will adversely impact the profitability of restaurants in these types of sites the risks related to building a customer base and managing development and operating costs in some or all of these types of trade areas or restaurant sites may also be more significant than in our traditional sites which could result in unexpected negative impacts on our new restaurant operating results 

we may continue to be negatively impacted by food safety incidents and further instances of foodborne or localized illnesses associated with our restaurants would result in increased negative publicity and further adverse impacts on customer perceptions of our brand 

during late october and early november 2015 illnesses caused by e coli bacteria were connected to a number of our restaurants initially in washington and oregon and subsequently to small numbers of our restaurants in as many as 12 other states during the week of december 7 2015 an unrelated incident involving norovirus was reported at a chipotle restaurant in brighton massachusetts which worsened the adverse financial and operating impacts we experienced from the e coli incident as a result of these incidents and related publicity our sales and profitability were severely impacted throughout 2016 in july 2017 cases of norovirus associated with a chipotle restaurant in sterling virginia had a further adverse impact on our sales particularly throughout the midatlantic and northeast regions the significant amount of media coverage regarding these incidents as well as the impact of social media which was not in existence during many past food safety incidents involving other restaurant chains in increasing the awareness of these incidents may continue to negatively impact customer perceptions of our restaurants and brand notwithstanding the high volume of foodborne illness cases from other sources across the country every day as a result our sales may not return to levels we were achieving prior to late 2015 

 

because of customer perceptions in the wake of these food safety incidents any future occurrence of foodborne illness associated with our restaurants—even incidents that may be considered minor at other restaurants—would likely have an even more significant negative impact on our sales and our ability to regain customers although we have followed industry standard food safety protocols in the past and over the past two years have enhanced our food safety procedures to ensure that our food is as safe as it can possibly be we may still be at a higher risk for foodborne illness occurrences than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh unprocessed produce and meats our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation and our avoiding frozen ingredients additionally no food safety protocols can completely eliminate the risk of foodborne illness in any restaurant including as a result of possible failures by suppliers or restaurant personnel to follow food safety policies and procedures as a result our enhanced food safety protocols may not be successful in preventing illness incidents in the future the risk of illnesses associated with our food might also increase in connection with an expansion of our catering business or other situations in which our food is served in conditions we cannot control furthermore we have seen instances of unsubstantiated reports linking illnesses to chipotle and these reports have negatively impacted us even if foodborne illnesses are attributed to us erroneously or arise from conditions outside of our control the negative impact from any such illnesses is likely to be significant all of these factors could have a further impact on our ability to attract and retain customers 

our marketing and advertising strategies may not be successful or may pose risks that could adversely impact our business 

in 2017 we hired a new advertising agency and media buyer introduced a new advertising campaign and media strategies including television advertising and introduced queso our first significant new menu item in a number of years we will continue to invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand if these investments do not drive increased restaurant sales the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect additionally if our marketing and advertising strategies are not successful we may be forced to engage in additional promotional activities to attract and retain customers including buyone getone offers and other offers for free or discounted food and any such promotional activities could adversely impact our profitability 

we also plan to continue to emphasize strategies such as remote ordering new catering options and delivery in an effort to increase overall sales these efforts may not increase our sales to the degree we expect or at all we may also seek to introduce new menu items that may not generate the sales we expect catering and other outofrestaurant sales options or new menu items may also introduce new operating procedures to our restaurants and we may not successfully execute these procedures which could adversely impact the customer experience in our restaurants and thereby harm our sales and customer perceptions of our brand 

in addition some of our marketing has incorporated elements intended to encourage customers to question sources or production methods commonly used to produce food these elements of our marketing could alienate food suppliers and other food industry groups and may potentially lead to an increased risk of disputes or litigation if suppliers or other constituencies believe our marketing is unfair or misleading increased costs in connection with any such issues or any deterioration in our relationships with existing suppliers could adversely impact us or our reputation furthermore if these messages do not resonate with our customers or potential customers the value of our brand may be eroded 

our expansion into international markets has been limited and may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors 

as of december 31 2017 37 of our restaurants were located outside of the us with 24 in canada six in the united kingdom six in france and one in frankfurt germany our focus for the present time remains on expanding in north america which limits our nearterm growth potential 

as a result of our small number of restaurants outside the us and the relatively short time we have been operating those restaurants we have lower brand awareness and less operating experience in these markets and our average restaurant sales andor transaction counts may be lower in these markets than in the us the markets in which we’ve opened restaurants outside the us and any additional new markets we enter outside the us in the future have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our us markets as a result new restaurants outside the us may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets specifically due to lower consumer familiarity with the chipotle brand differences in customer tastes or spending patterns or for other reasons sales at restaurants opened outside the us may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall growth and profitability to build brand awareness in international markets we may need to make greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations in those markets 

we may also find it more difficult in international markets to hire train and keep top performing employees who can successfully deliver excellent customer experiences and labor costs may be higher in international markets due to increased 

 

regulation higher employment taxes or social benefit costs or local market conditions in addition restaurants outside the us have had higher construction occupancy and food costs than restaurants in existing markets and we may have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards additional costs or difficulties from any of the foregoing factors may adversely impact the operating results of our international markets markets outside the us may also have regulatory differences with the us with which we are not familiar or that subject us to significant additional expense or to which we are not able to successfully adapt which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could adversely impact our overall results for example a new privacy regulation in the european union called the general data protection regulation or gdpr is scheduled to become effective in may 2018 and requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of our worldwide revenue our overall results may also be negatively affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar 

pizzeria locale tasty made and other new restaurant concepts may not contribute to our growth 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based – finding better ingredients preparing them using classic techniques in front of the customer and serving them in an interactive format with great teams dedicated to providing an excellent dining experience – can be adapted to cuisines other than the food served at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened a number of shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants beginning in 2011 and one tasty made burger restaurant in ohio in 2016 we enlisted an equity partner to help us refine the tasty made brand in 2017 we also have a majority ownership interest in a company operating seven fast casual pizzeria locale restaurants in denver colorado kansas city missouri and cincinnati ohio and we plan to assist with the further expansion of pizzeria locale in the future shophouse was not able to achieve a level of sales and profitability that made it attractive to us for future investment and we recognized a 145 million noncash impairment charge representing substantially all of the value of longlived assets of shophouse during the year ended december 31 2016 and closed all of the shophouse locations in the first half of 2017 furthermore pizzeria locale and tasty made are new brands and have lower brand awareness lower sales and less operating experience than most chipotle restaurants and may also not achieve restaurant economics that make them attractive for further investment in the future these concepts also operate in markets in which there are numerous competitors including a number of large and wellknown brands and a number of other companies or individuals in the restaurant industry have recently opened or invested in fastcasual pizza concepts or socalled “better burger” restaurants 

notwithstanding our growth plans for tasty made our investment in pizzeria locale and exploration of other restaurant brand opportunities our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand as a result we do not expect pizzeria locale tasty made or other concepts to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years we may also determine not to move forward with any further expansion of tasty made or pizzeria locale these decisions would each limit our overall growth potential over the long term as well additionally the expansion of tasty made or pizzeria locale or investments in other restaurant concepts each might distract our management which could have an adverse impact on our core chipotle business 

our failure to manage our restaurant growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

as described elsewhere in this report our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls information systems and personnel may be inadequate to support our expansion and managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls as well as to hire train and retain general managers crew and corporate staff we also are continuing to attempt to improve our field management in an effort to improve restaurant operations and develop additional top performing general managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our restaurant growth imposes on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate we have also historically placed a great deal of importance on restaurant cultures which we believe needs to be redirected to focus more on effective training of our team to deliver excellent customer experiences as we grow our number of restaurants additional shifts in our cultural or operational focus may harm morale in our restaurants or prove distracting to our restaurant employees which could adversely impact our business and operating results 

risks related to operating in the restaurant industry 

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location brand reputation and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locallyowned restaurants and 

 

national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout online catering and delivery services among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally in recent years competition has also increased significantly from restaurant formats like ours that serve higher quality food quickly and at a reasonable price 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores cafeterias and other dining outlets meal kit delivery companies and other eatathome options also present some degree of competition for our restaurants in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

we believe that competition from all of the foregoing has made it more challenging to maintain or increase the frequency of our customer visits and that those competitive pressures will continue or increase in the future 

many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have these and other competitors may attract customers with among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs and prices better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

additionally although we continue to believe that chipotle can differentiate itself with our commitment to higherquality and responsiblysourced ingredients competitors have increasingly made claims related to the quality of their ingredients or distinctions between artificial and natural flavors colors and preservatives the increasing use of these claims in the marketplace even if the substantive basis for some of them may be questionable may lessen our differentiation and make it more difficult for us to compete some of these competitors and other fast casual concepts have sought to duplicate various elements of our business operations and more chains may copy us to varying degrees in the future 

several of our competitors also compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these and other competing products or by price competition more generally 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding training and retaining top performing employees 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew and outstanding training are key parts of our success increased labor costs due to factors such as competition for workers and labor market pressures increased minimum wage requirements paid sick leave or vacation accrual mandates or changes in our restaurant staffing structure have and may continue to adversely impact our operating costs many companies both in the restaurant industry and in other industries with which we compete for employees have implemented companywide or targeted increases in starting wages or other enhancements to their compensation and benefit programs and we may need to act similarly to continue to attract employees for instance in 2018 we plan to increase benefits to salaried and hourly managers including additional paid leave short term disability coverage and a onetime cash bonus to all restaurant employees which will increase our labor costs these enhancements and any further increases in labor costs associated with additional market pressures on wages or other factors will adversely impact our operating results 

moreover if our managers do not schedule our restaurant crews efficiently our restaurants may be overstaffed at some times which adversely impacts our labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreasing our operating margins efficient staffing may continue to be a challenge in 2018 due to continued volatility and uncertainty in our sales trends   additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits expenses could also adversely impact our labor costs and during 2018 we expect to hire a greater proportion of our restaurant managers from outside our company than we have in the past these employees may be more expensive to hire and train than managers promoted from crew and we may not successfully integrate them into our restaurant teams which could adversely impact our operations 

in addition our success in delivering excellent customer experiences depends substantially on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire train motivate and keep qualified employees especially general managers and crew members turnover among our restaurant crews and managers has been frequent and we aim to reduce turnover in an effort to keep top 

 

performing employees and better realize our investment in training new employees failure to do so will adversely impact our operating results by increasing training costs and making it more difficult to deliver outstanding customer experiences our failure to find and keep enough highcaliber employees could also delay planned restaurant openings which would slow our growth 

we use the “everify” program an internetbased free program run by the us government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company however use of everify does not guarantee that we will successfully identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment although we use everify and require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if we are found to be employing unauthorized workers we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees for example following an audit by the department of homeland security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota during 2010 we lost approximately 450 employees resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations including slower throughput as we trained new employees as well as some degree of negative publicity the resulting broadbased civil and criminal investigations by the us attorney for the district of columbia and us securities and exchange commission of our compliance with work authorization requirements and related disclosures and statements resulted in significant legal costs termination of a significant number of employees in specific markets or across our company due to work authorization or other regulatory issues would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees we could also become subject to fines penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors furthermore immigration laws have been an area of considerable political focus in recent years and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs further changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and potential liability and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees 

because we do not franchise risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring payment and termination of employees and employeerelated litigation may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions global demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and cooking oils has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice in 2017 a significant rise in avocado prices adversely impacted our food costs for most of the year and there could be similar or greater pricing pressure on key ingredients in future periods costs have also increased from the enhanced food safety procedures described elsewhere in this report additionally a substantial volume of produce items are grown in mexico and other countries and some of our meats and restaurant supplies are sourced from outside the us as well any new or increased import duties tariffs or taxes or other changes in us trade or tax policy could result in higher food and supply costs that would adversely impact our financial results 

we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and animal welfare criteria or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for food products that are conventionally raised and grown weather related issues such as freezes or drought may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as produce or meats increasing weather volatility or other longterm changes in global weather patterns including any changes associated with global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would have a particularly adverse effect on our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales and could also have an adverse impact on our brand 

 

food safety scares could adversely affect customer perceptions of or the price or availability of ingredients we use to prepare our food which may adversely impact our sales 

past reports linking nationwide or regional incidents of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella e coli hepatitis a listeria or norovirus to certain produce items have caused us to temporarily suspend serving some ingredients in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu and have resulted in consumers avoiding certain products for a period of time similarly outbreaks of avian flu incidents of “mad cow” disease or similar concerns have also caused consumers to avoid any products that are or are suspected of being affected these problems and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse effect on the price and availability of affected ingredients a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants due to the types of food scares described above would further adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability in addition if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient or operating costs resulting from supply problems or operational changes associated with incidents of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

changes we have made in our operations or that we make in the future to further enhance the safety of the food we serve will adversely impact our financial performance and may negatively impact customer perception of our brand 

as a result of the food safety incidents described elsewhere in this report we have implemented a number of enhancements to our food safety protocols to ensure that our food is as safe as it can be many of our enhanced procedures which go beyond the industrystandard food safety practices that we were previously following increase the cost of some ingredients or the amount of labor required to prepare and serve our food if we aren’t able to sufficiently increase sales to offset the increased costs resulting from these changes our margins will fall well short of levels we have historically achieved even if we were to restore sales to levels we were achieving prior to the fourth quarter of 2015 the increased costs from these changes are likely to result in lower margins than we were able to achieve in the past 

additionally some of the enhanced food safety procedures we have introduced or may introduce in the future rely on increased use of centralized food preparation additional inrestaurant preparation steps or new ingredients some or all of which may be inconsistent with previous customer perceptions of our restaurant operations to the extent customers perceive any of these developments as a move away from our food with integrity strategy andor towards a more traditional fast food experience our ability to win back customers may be adversely impacted and our sales may decline or recover more slowly than they otherwise would have furthermore even the most advanced food safety measures cannot eliminate all food safety risks from a restaurant environment for risks related to any future food safety incidents associated with our restaurants see “ risks related to our plans to improve our sales and profitability and restore our economic model – we may continue to be negatively impacted by food safety incidents and further instances of foodborne or localized illnesses associated with our restaurants would result in increased negative publicity and further adverse impacts on customer perceptions of our brand ” 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination which we may detect more frequently under the microbiological testing protocols we’ve recently introduced inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or deciding not to follow our required protocols or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations in particular shortages of one or more of our menu items could force our restaurants to remove items from their menus which may result in customers choosing to eat elsewhere if that happens our affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the menu item shortage and potentially thereafter if customers do not return to us after the shortage is resolved our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe to us than at other restaurants 

for many of our food ingredients and other supplies we do not have longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on a third party distribution network with a limited number of distribution partners if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason the risk of ingredient shortages may increase and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken tofu beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our food with integrity suppliers and as described in more detail below under “ risks related to our unique business strategy — our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks ” these 

 

suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

in the first quarter of 2015 through our ongoing auditing of suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards and suspended purchases of pork from this supplier without this supply we did not have enough pork meeting our specifications for all of our restaurants and a large number of our restaurants were not serving carnitas for a number of months during 2015 we believe our comparable restaurant sales were adversely impacted as a result as customers chose to eat elsewhere rather than substituting a different one of our menu items for carnitas 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods and our focus on a limited menu could make the consequences of a change in consumer preferences more severe than our competitors may face some customers could also avoid freshlyprepared foods like those we serve based on concerns regarding food safety this may be more likely to impact us as a result of the widelypublicized food safety incidents we experienced beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 

our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels our average restaurant sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty which can be caused by various factors such as high unemployment increasing taxes interest rates or other changes in fiscal or monetary policy high gasoline prices declining home prices tight credit markets or foreign political or economic unrest any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

if we were to experience widespread difficulty renewing existing leases on favorable terms our revenue or occupancy costs could be adversely affected 

we lease substantially all of the properties on which we operate restaurants and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value which could involve substantial increases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals could adversely impact us if we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants conversely substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs reducing our restaurant margins 

risks related to our unique business strategy 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice restaurant segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create additionally it will likely be more difficult for us to persuade the public about the quality and value of our food following the foodborne illnesses we experienced in 2015 and the associated deterioration of customer perceptions about our brand and we cannot predict when those perceptions will improve if ever if customers are not persuaded that we offer a good value for their money our restaurant transaction counts could be adversely affected which would negatively impact our business results 

 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

the principle of food with integrity constitutes a significant part of our business strategy we use a substantial amount of ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on practices we believe to be more sustainable or responsible than some conventional practices and we try to make our food as fresh as we can we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity philosophy there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are more responsible farming practices as well as uncertainty regarding demand due to changing customer perceptions economic trends and other factors many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area although all of our restaurants generally serve meat from animals raised in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we may experience shortages of meat meeting these criteria due to suppliers suspending production market conditions or other forces beyond our control in the first quarter of 2015 through our ongoing auditing of suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards and suspended purchases of pork from this supplier without this supply we did not have enough pork meeting our specifications for all of our restaurants and a large number of our restaurants were not serving carnitas for a number of months during 2015 we believe our comparable restaurant sales were adversely impacted as a result we have experienced shortages of beef or chicken meeting our protocols on a periodic basis over the past several years as well resulting in our serving commodity beef and chicken which may have a negative impact on customer perceptions of our brand 

if as a result of any of the factors described above we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of our preferred ingredients on a costeffective basis our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with our food with integrity philosophy which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline our commitment to the food with integrity philosophy may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our food with integrity approach any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants we may also face adverse publicity or liability for false advertising claims if suppliers do not adhere to all of the elements of our food with integrity programs such as responsible meat protocols requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods our use of nongmo ingredients in our food and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions if any such supplier failures occur and are publicized our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted and our food with integrity message may result in customers holding us to a higher standard in terms of food safety as well which may make it more difficult for us to recover from the foodborne illness incidents discussed elsewhere in this report as customers who believe we failed to uphold our own standards may decline to return to our restaurants as frequently or at all 

additionally in response to increasing customer awareness and demand some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones dairy products from cows not treated with rbgh and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our food with integrity philosophy if competitors become known for using these types of higherquality or more sustainable ingredients it could further limit our supply of these ingredients and may make it more difficult for us to differentiate chipotle and our restaurants which could adversely impact our operating results 

our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel and upcoming changes in our management team may not provide the benefits we expect 

our chairman and chief executive officer steve ells founded our company has been the principal architect of our business strategy and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 2400 restaurants today jack hartung our chief financial officer has also served with us since early in our company’s history and much of our growth has occurred under his direction as well additionally mark crumpacker our chief marketing and strategy officer who has played a role in our marketing and branding efforts for many years and who has been an executive officer since joining us full time in january 2009 has been instrumental in formulating strategies to help us rebuild our business curt garner who joined us as chief information officer in november 2015 has had a key role in developing and executing our digitalmobile ordering platforms and strategy and we believe these and other technology innovations will become increasingly important in helping us return to sales and profitability growth and scott boatwright who joined us as chief restaurant officer in may 2017 has led our recent efforts to improve the guest experience in our restaurants which we also believe will be critical in attracting new and lapsed customers 

in december 2017 we announced that we have initiated a search for a new chief executive officer and that mr ells will transition to the role of executive chairman of the board upon the appointment of a new chief executive officer it may be difficult to identify and attract a chief executive officer candidate who meets our needs and is able to grasp and implement our unique 

 

strategic vision in addition we believe our current executive officers each of whom is an atwill employee are creating a business strategy and culture at our company that will position us for future success and these features may be difficult to replicate under another management team if a new chief executive officer does not successfully continue our business strategy or implement new strategies to improve our business or if the change in chief executive officer or other factors result in other changes to our senior leadership team our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted additionally if our company culture or operations were to deteriorate following our upcoming change in leadership we may be adversely impacted as well 

regulatory and legal risks 

governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs 

employment and immigration regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules and antidiscrimination laws complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for noncompliance for example a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee classification employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we incur legal costs to defend and we could suffer losses from these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant in addition several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases changes to eligibility for overtime pay paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs changes in us healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses 

we also are audited from time to time for compliance with work authorization requirements and audit activity and federal criminal and civil investigations in this area are described in more detail above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding and retaining top performing employees ” as well as in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees on the other hand in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants we could be found to be in violation of antidiscrimination laws we could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance antidiscrimination compliance or both that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees moreover as described above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding and retaining top performing employees ” the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia and the us securities and exchange commission investigated us for possible criminal and civil securities law violations relating to our employee work authorization compliance and related disclosures and statements as well any potential future investigations in this area may be expensive and distracting and could subject us to fines reputational damage and other liabilities that could be significant 

additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize our employees and those of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired potential changes in labor laws including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture 

americans with disabilities act and similar state laws 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act or ada and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we have incurred substantial legal fees in connection with adarelated complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for 

 

disabled persons under these laws the expenses associated with these modifications or any damages legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ada or similar state laws could be material 

nutrition and food regulation 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and a number of other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available and nationwide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the us health care reform law are scheduled to go into effect on may 7 2018 these nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales and could subject us to liability if we make errors in calculating or disclosing the required information 

privacycybersecurity 

we are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is evolving and increasingly demanding   significant new privacy regulation in the european union is further described above under “ risks related to our plans to improve our sales and profitability and restore our economic model – our expansion into international markets has been limited and may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors ” at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf if our security and information systems or those of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees additional risks related to cybersecurity are described below under “ general business riskswe may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information ” 

local licensure zoning and other regulation 

each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

environmental laws 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

other aspects of regulatory risk 

from time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various laws and regulations that cover our business much of this litigation occurs in california even though currently only about 17 of our restaurants are located there as we continue to 

 

expand in california or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in california our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in or minimized our operations in california 

because we do not franchise the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business as described above may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

regulatory actions and litigation related to food safety incidents that impacted us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 may adversely impact us 

we are facing an ongoing government investigation into food safety incidents and related compliance measures as described in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we also have received numerous claims from customers who were or claim to have been impacted by food safety incidents associated with our restaurants and a number of those claimants have filed lawsuits against us we are cooperating in the government investigation and with many of the customers impacted by these incidents but will continue to incur significant legal and other costs in doing so we have also been sued in a shareholder class action lawsuit in connection with the decline in our stock price in the wake of the food safety incidents and defending this lawsuit will subject us to significant legal expense additionally the liabilities from customer claims and related litigation expenses may be greater than we anticipate due to the uncertainties inherent in litigation all of these costs liabilities and expenses will negatively impact our operating results moreover publicity regarding any legal proceedings related to food safety incidents may increase or prolong consumer awareness of the incidents or otherwise negatively impact perceptions of our brand which may hamper our ability to regain lost sales or attract new customers to our restaurants 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

we’re subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters including wages work hours overtime vacation and family leave discrimination wrongful termination and similar matters and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future our customers also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we’re responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices see “— governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs ” above for additional discussion of these types of claims from time to time we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertising practices we have been subject to a number of these actions and may be subject to additional actions of this type in the future we are also undergoing government investigations and have been sued in a shareholder class action lawsuit each as described elsewhere in this report including in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and these matters may be particularly expensive to defend andor resolve 

we believe the number of many of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers particularly in california regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we’re ultimately held liable for such claims they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations whether directed at us or at fast casual or quickservice restaurants generally may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects which in turn could adversely affect our results 

general business risks 

we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2017 approximately 73 of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen including a number of highly publicized incidents with wellknown retailers in recent years 

 

in april 2017 our information security team detected unauthorized activity on the network that supports payment processing for our restaurants and immediately began an investigation with the help of leading computer security firms we also selfreported the issue to payment card processors and law enforcement our investigation detected malware designed to access payment card data from cards used at pointofsale devices at most chipotle restaurants primarily in the period from march 24 2017 through april 18 2017 we have removed the malware from our systems and continue to work to enhance our security measures however we expect to be subject to payment card network assessments and may incur regulatory fines or penalties for which our insurance coverage is limited and as a result we recorded a 30 million estimated liability we may ultimately be subject to liabilities greater than or less than the amount accrued see note 10 “commitments and contingencies” included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion of potential liabilities and pending litigation filed against us in connection with this incident 

we may be subject to additional lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to the incident or any future incidents in which payment card data may have been compromised proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

we also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding for example a new privacy regulation in the european union called the general data protection regulation or gdpr is scheduled to become effective in may 2018 and requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf we have seen an increase over the past several years in the frequency and sophistication of attempts to compromise the security of several of these systems if the security and information systems that we or our outsourced third party providers use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees 

if we experience a significant failure in or interruption of certain key information technology systems our business could be adversely impacted 

we use a variety of applications and systems to securely manage the flow of information within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure the services available within our systems and applications include restaurant operations supply chain inventory scheduling training human capital management financial tools and data protection services the restaurant structure is based primarily on a pointofsale system that operates locally at the restaurant and is integrated with other functions necessary to restaurant operations it records sales transactions receives out of store orders and authorizes batches and transmits credit card transactions the system also allows employees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant is collected in the central corporate infrastructure which enables management to continually monitor operating results our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systems and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our pointofsale system and related networks and applications these systems may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches viruses and other disruptive problems as well as from physical theft fire power loss telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events any failure of these systems to operate effectively whether from security breaches maintenance problems upgrades or transitions to new platforms or other factors could result in interruptions to or delays in our restaurant or other operations adversely impacting the restaurant experience for our guests or negatively impacting our ability to manage our business if our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected in addition remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

 

negative publicity relating to our restaurants or our company could adversely impact our reputation which may significantly harm us 

we depend significantly on customers’ perception of and connection to our brand in addition to the damage to our reputation from wellpublicized food safety incidents during 2015 as described elsewhere in this report we may experience negative publicity from time to time relating to food quality customer complaints restaurant facilities advertising and other business practices litigation alleging injuries or improper employee practices government investigations or other regulatory issues our suppliers’ potential failure to adhere to elements of our food with integrity protocols other issues regarding the integrity of our suppliers’ food processing employee relationships customer or employee data breaches or other matters regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held to be responsible the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one or more restaurants or any of the foregoing topics may extend far beyond the restaurants involved and affect many more or even all of our restaurants the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated a similar risk exists with respect to unrelated food service businesses if consumers associate those businesses with our own operations and even publicity that could reasonably be viewed as positive may have adverse consequences on our business for example positive developments in regards to the food safety issues that have impacted us might have the effect of continuing or increasing customer awareness of the issue 

the adverse impact of publicity on customers’ perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales if the impact of any such publicity is particularly longlasting the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished additionally negative publicity about our employment practices may affect our reputation among employees and potential employees which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain top performing employees that could adversely impact the quality of the customer experience we can offer and our operations generally and may increase our labor costs as well 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health workers’ compensation general liability property damage and auto liability we are selfinsured for our employee health plans but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for workers’ compensation general liability property damage employment practices liability and auto liability insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is relatively short and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations it is also possible that losses covered under one or more of our insurance policies may exceed the applicable policy limits which would subject us to unexpected additional liabilities in an amount that could be significant enough to have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos our food with integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quart erly results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors because of factors including 

﻿ 



﻿ 

seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading days—that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall this risk may continue to be a greater concern during 2018 as analyst and investor expectations for improvements in our business results may be higher than the level of results we actually achieve 

additionally we believe the market price of our common stock which has generally traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most or all of our peer companies has typically reflected high market expectations for our future operating results the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times as well including during the recent past as a result of adverse publicity events as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated 

 

bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

steve ells our founder chairman and ceo started chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience today we continue to offer a focused menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls and salads made from fresh highquality raw ingredients prepared using classic cooking methods and served in an interactive style allowing people to get what they want we seek out extraordinary ingredients that are not only fresh but that are raised responsibly with respect for the animals land and people who produce them we prepare our food using real wholesome ingredients and without the use of artificial colors or flavors typically found in fast food chipotle opened with a single restaurant in denver in 1993 and as of december 31 2017 we operated 2408 restaurants 

sales our sales and profitability improved during 2017 as compared to 2016 comparable restaurant sales increased 64 as a result of an increase in the average check including a 12 benefit from menu price increases implemented in about 500 restaurants during the second quarter of 2017 and 900 restaurants during the fourth quarter of 2017 comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation average restaurant sales were 1940 million as of december 31 2017 increasing from 1868 million as of december 31 2016 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months we expect comparable restaurant sales increases in the low single digits for the full year 2018 including the benefit from extending menu price increases to almost 950 additional restaurants in january 2018 sales growth from new restaurant openings however will be lower in 2018 than in the past due to our planned decrease in new restaurant openings during the year as discussed below under “restaurant development” 

during 2017 we invested in improving our digital platforms including significant improvements to our mobile application and online ordering platform and equipping select restaurants with an upgraded second make line dedicated to fulfilling outofrestaurant orders sales from outofrestaurant orders represented 83 of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2017 up from 64 of revenue during the year ended december 31 2016 additionally in september 2017 we introduced an allnatural queso which was ordered in approximately 10 of our transactions in january 2018   

restaurant operating costs  during the full year 2017 our restaurant operating costs food beverage and packaging labor occupancy and other operating costs as a percent of revenue decreased 41 compared to the full year 2016 the decrease was attributable to sales leverage including the benefit of the menu price increases lower marketing and promotional spend as a percent of revenue and labor efficiencies partially offset by higher wages paid to crew and managers 

restaurant development  as of december 31 201 7  we had 2408 restaurants in operation including 2363 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states with an additional 37 international chipotle restaurants and eight nonchipotle restaurants that were consolidated into our financial results   w e opened 183 restaurants in 201 7 including two relocations and closed 23 additional restaurants including 15 shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants   we intend to open between 130 and 150 restaurants for the full year 2018 as we focus our resources on improving our operations and delivering an outstanding experience to every one of our guests most of our 2018 restaurant openings are planned in markets that already have a chipotle presence established 

tax law changes in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law and among other changes the act lowered the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 as a result we recognized a 60 million benefit in our provision for income taxes related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax position at the lower rate 

﻿ 

we expect our 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 30 to 31 which includes an underlying effective tax rate of 27 to 28 and around 3 to 4 related to stock awards as discussed in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the adoption of asu no 201609 “compensationstock compensation topic 718” will subject our tax rate to quarterly volatility from the effect of stock award exercise and vesting activities additionally we have deferred tax assets related to outstanding nonvested stock awards that contain market conditions if market conditions are not achieved then we may not realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets which would result in a higher effective tax rate in future periods  we believe the stock awards granted in 2015 and 2016 that contain market conditions will increase our tax rate in the first and fourth quarters of 2018 respectively 

﻿ 

 

during 2018 we expect to use a portion of the savings from the lower federal corporate income tax rate to provide enhanced benefits to our employees including by making all restaurant managers and crew eligible for a onetime cash bonus awarding onetime stock bonuses to a broad group of staff employees and enhancing a number of other benefits such as parental leave and shortterm disability additionally we will use a portion of the savings by investing in our existing restaurants we expect these initiatives to increase labor other operating and general and administrative expenses and to result in higher capital expenditures than we have typically incurred 

﻿ 

management and governance  during the second quarter of 2017 we announced that we hired scott boatwright as chief restaurant officer and scott has assumed oversight of operations for all north american chipotle restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2017 we announced that steve ells our chairman and ceo will become executive chairman following the completion of a search to identify a new ceo for risks associated with our planned installation of a new ceo see “ risks related to our unique business strategy –   our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel and upcoming changes in our management team may not provide the benefits we expect” in item 1a “risk factors” 

data security incident  in april 2017 we detected malware on the network that supports payment processing for our restaurants and subsequently determined that the malware searched for track data which may include cardholder name card number expiration date and internal verification codes we removed the malware from our systems and continue to evaluate ways to enhance our security measures   see “ general business risks — we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information ” in item 1a “risk factors” as well as note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion of the payment card security incident and related legal proceedings 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded a liability of 300 million 182 million after tax or 064 per basic and diluted earnings per share as an estimate of potential losses associated with anticipated claims and assessments by payment card networks we may ultimately be subject to liabilities greater or less than the amount accrued

results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our aggregate restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization generally increase 

﻿ 

revenue 



 

the significant factors contributing to the increase in revenue in 2017 were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed 3388 million to the revenue increase of which 1491 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2017 and comparable restaurant sales increased 2332 million the increase in comparable restaurant sales was attributable to an increase in average check including a 12 benefit from menu price increases 

in 201 6  t he decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in comparable restaurant sales which we attribute primarily to the impact of food safety incidents beginning in late 2015 partially offset by new restaurant openings   c omparable restaurant sales decreased  9147 million while revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed  3239 million of which  1562 million w as attributable to restaurants opened in 2016   

food beverage and packaging costs   



food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 primarily due to the benefit of the menu price increases taken in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarters of 2017 food beverage and packaging costs also benefitted from bringing the preparation of lettuce and bell peppers back into our restaurants after using precut produce during portions of 2016 and cost savings initiatives resulting in lower prices and usage of paper and packaging products these decreases were partially offset by higher avocado prices we expect food beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue in 2018 to be lower than 2017 due to the benefit of menu price increases and our expectations for stable commodity prices 

food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 201 6 primarily due to   increased waste and costs related to new food safety procedures as well as higher avocado prices  partially offset by relief in beef prices in dollar terms food beverage an d packaging costs decreased in 2016 due to lower sales 

labor costs   



labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased during the year ended december 31 2017 due primarily to increased crew efficiency including the benefit of lower promotional activity during the year improved manager deployment and sales leverage including the impact of menu price increases the decrease was partially offset by wage inflation we expect labor costs as a percentage of revenue to be higher in 2018 than 2017 due to labor inflation and the enhanced benefits described above under “overview – tax law changes” 

labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 201 6 due primarily to sales deleveraging and wage inflation  partially offset by labor efficiencies resulting from fewer managers and crew in each of our restaurants labor costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31 2016 due to staffing needs for new restaurants    

occupancy costs   



occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2017 primarily due to sales leverage on a largely fixedcost base 

 

occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 201 6 primarily due to lower average restaurant sales on a large ly fixedcost base  o ccupancy costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 3 1  2016 primarily due to costs associated with new restaurants 

other operating costs   



other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs bank and credit card fees and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 due primarily to decreased marketing and promotional spend sales leverage including the benefit of menu price increases and decreased kitchen supplies expense marketing and promotional spend decreased to 35 of revenue in 2017 as compared to 51 of revenue in 2016 we expect other operating costs as a percentage of revenue in 2018 to remain consistent with 2017 as planned lower marketing and promotional spend is offset by expected higher maintenance costs from investments in our existing restaurants 

other operating c osts increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due primarily to higher ma rketing and promotional expense as well as sales deleveraging   we increased our marketing and promotional spend in an effort to regain customers which contributed  982 million to the increase  

general and administrative expenses   



general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms in 2017 due to recording a liability of 300 million as an estimate of potential losses associated with anticipated claims and assessments by payment card networks for the data security incident that occurred in 2017 increased bonus costs and higher noncash stockbased compensation expense also contributed to the increase the increase was partially offset by lower legal costs and decreased meeting costs because of the biennial all managers conference held in september 2016 the increase in stockbased compensation expense during 2017 was primarily a result of a cumulative reduction of expense in 2016 for performance share awards that were no longer expected to vest we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms in 2018 due to increased wages and benefits the biennial all managers’ conference planned for the third quarter of 2018 and an increase in stockbased compensation expense 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms for 201 6 primarily resulted from increased legal expense higher payroll costs as we grew and expense s associated with our biennial all managers’ conference held during 201 6 partially offset by   lower   bonus expense and travel costs 

depreciation and amortization   



depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 due to sales leverage on a partially fixedcost base 

depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due to   sales deleveraging  the increase in dollar terms was due primarily to depreciation and amortization costs associated with new restaurants 

 

loss on disposal and impairment of assets 



loss on disposal and impairment of assets during the year ended december 31 2017 consisted primarily of charges related to the closure of underperforming chipotle restaurants and the replacement of certain kitchen equipment 

loss on disposal and impairment of assets increased in 201 6   primarily due to   a noncash impairment charge of 145 million to writedown substantially all of the value of the longlived assets of our 15 shophouse restaurants  

income tax provision 



the 2017 annual effective tax rate was lower than the 2016 rate due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act resulting in our recording a benefit for the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability as well as from a lower state tax rate the decrease in our effective tax rate was partially offset by federal credits on overall higher pretax operating income 

the 2016 effective tax rate was higher than 2015 due to a higher state tax rate not qualifying for the federal research and development tax credit in 2016 whereas we did qualify for the credit in 2015 and other federal credits on overall lower pretax operating income 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2017 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 



 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales are lower and net income has generally been lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results although on an overall annual basis changes in trading days do not have a significant impact 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as   the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter the amount and timing of noncash stockbased compensation expense and anticipated and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction initiatives to improve the guest experience in our restaurants working capital  and general corporate needs  as of december 31 2017 we had a cash and shortterm investment balance of 5090 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business to invest in maintain and refurbish our existing restaurants  to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions  and f or general corporate purposes as of december 31 2017 there was 1183 million remaining available under repurchase authorizations previously approved by our board of directors under the remaining repurchase authorizations shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions subject to market conditions we believe that cash from operations together with our cash and investment balances will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

our total capital expen ditures for 2017 were 2168 million  in 2017 we spent on average about 835000 in development and construction costs per new restaurant or about 735000 net of landlord reimbursements of 100000   in 2018 we expect to incur about 300 million in   total cap ital expenditures we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to consist of investments in existing restaurants including remodeling and similar improvements and upgrading our second make lines and other restaurant equipment we also expect about 120 million in capital expenditures relate d to our construction of new restaurants  before any reductions for landlord reimbursements  for new restaurants to be opened in 2018 we anticipate average development costs will increase due to initiatives planned in most of our new restaurants such as the addition of the upgraded second make line finally we expect a portion of our capital expenditures for the year to be incurred for additional corporate initiatives 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 201 7 were as follows 



  



  



﻿ 

the above table does not include i ncome tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments additionally we have excluded our estimated loss contin g encies related to the data security incident described elsewhere due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of payment see note 10 “commitments and contingencies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 201 7 and 201 6  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor healthcare costs fuel utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level  additionally many of our leases require us to pay property taxes maintenance and utilitie s  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases there have been and there may be in the future delays in implementing such menu price increases if we do raise menu prices in the future general competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our signific ant accounting policies in note 1  “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumpt ions or factors we believe that of our critical accounting estimates the following involve a higher degree of judgement and subjectivity   

leases 

we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straightline basis over the reasonably assured lease term the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights or sosars and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards and sosars with performancebased vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different certain awards that contain service performance and market conditions have vesting criteria based on chipotle’s relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in annual average revenue growth 

 

net income growth and total shareholder return our estimates of chipotle’s future performance and the future perfo rmance of the restaurant industry peer group are assumptions that involve a high degree of subjectivity if we had arrived at different assumptions for revenue growth or net income for chipotle or the peer group our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different   

insurance liability 

we are selfinsured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers’ compensation general liability employee health property and auto damage but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is relatively short and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2017 were 520 million 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequen tly we were unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2017  although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

commodity price risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials and utilities to run our restaurants are ingredients or commodities that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices  and range forward protocols under which we agree on a price range for the duration of that protocol however a majority of the dollar value of our purchases is effectively at spot prices generally  our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 24 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where practical  the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance 

changing interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 201 7  we had 3621 million in investments and interestbearing cas h accounts including insurance related restricted trust account s classified in other assets and 1293 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 097  

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us  and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date

chipotle mexican grill inc a delaware corporation together with its subsidiaries “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operates chipotle mexican grill restaurants which serve a focused menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads made using fresh ingredients as of december 31 2016 we operated 2198 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states as well as 29 international chipotle restaurants and we also had 23 restaurants in operation in other nonchipotle concepts we focus on finding the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on building a strong people culture that is centered on providing an excellent guest experience on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with the highest regard for the safety of our customers and increasing awareness and respect for the environment we have grown substantially over the past five years and expect to open between 195 and 210 additional restaurants in 2017 

throughout our history as a public company we have pursued a mission to change the way people think about and eat fast food the fast food landscape has changed dramatically over chipotle’s 23year history the changes in the industry suggest that we may have achieved our mission with a number of concepts built using service and sourcing formats that closely resemble ours – with more selective sourcing food prepared onsite and a service model that allows customers to choose exactly what they eat looking at what we have accomplished we have expanded our mission today we are working to ensure that better food prepared from whole unprocessed ingredients is accessible to everyone  we are also aiming to simplify our business focus to emphasize only those things that result in an excellent guest experience in our restaurants 

we manage our operations and restaurants based on 11 regions that aggregate into one reportable segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 and our total assets as of december 31 2016 and 2015 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the us for a discussion of risks related to our international operations see risks related to our plans to return to sales and

our focus on safe and delicious food made with better ingredients 

a decidedly focused menu chipotle restaurants list only a few entree items burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from five different meats or tofu two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide thousands of choices we plan to keep a simple menu but will consider additions that we think make sense for example in 2014 we introduced sofritas a vegetarian protein option and in 2016 we introduced chorizo a spicy ground sausage made from chicken and pork 

in preparing our food we use classic cooking methods we use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice our restaurants do not have microwaves or freezers ingredients we use include chicken steak and chorizo that is grilled in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef sofritas organic braised tofu and vegetarian pinto and black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice freshly chopped cilantro and a pinch of salt as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions to our entrees depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also make a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime juice and salt in addition to sodas fruit and tea drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch from whole ingredients some of which is prepared in our restaurants and some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in larger batches in commissaries 

better food serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our mission to ensure that better food is accessible to everyone we believe that purchasing fresh ingredients and preparing them from scratch in our restaurants is not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on the sources of each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve the food we serve were all about simple fresh food without artificial flavors or fillers—just genuine raw ingredients and their individual delectable flavors 

in all of our chipotle restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare and without the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones we brand these meats as “responsibly raised ® ” one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to serve meats raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so for example some of our restaurants did not serve carnitas for a portion of 2015 and some of our restaurants periodically serve conventionally raised chicken or beef from time to time due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised meats more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats or stop serving one or more menu items in the future due to additional supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

we also seek to use more responsibly grown produce by which we mean produce grown by suppliers whose practices conform to our priorities with respect to environmental considerations and employee welfare a portion of our beans is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown a portion of some of the other produce items we serve is organically grown as well our commitment to better ingredients also extends to the dairy products we serve we started 2017 with all the sour cream and cheese we buy for our us chipotle restaurants made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh recombinant bovine growth hormone and sourced from pasturebased dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows 

in addition none of the ingredients in our food not including beverages in us chipotle restaurants   contain genetically modified organisms or gmos while the meat and poultry we serve is not genetically modified the animals are likely fed a diet of grains containing gmos due to the prevalence of gmos in a number of important feed crops the vast majority of the grains used as animal feed in the us are genetically modified additionally some of the beverages we serve are sweetened with corn based sweeteners which are typically made with genetically modified corn 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality and safety we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our 24 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and the suppliers’ understanding of our mission we work closely with our suppliers and seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols and our distribution centers purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers we’ve also tried to increase 

 

where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages and we follow industry news trade tariffs and other issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas are purchased from a small number of suppliers for a discussion of risks related to our supply chain see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry –   failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations” and “ risks related to our unique business strategy –   our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks” in item 1a “risk factors”     

quality assurance and food safety our business was severely impacted beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 by food safety incidents that were associated with a number of our restaurants more discussion of these incidents can be found in “ risks related to our plans to return to sales and profitability growth and restore our economic model – we may continue to be negatively impacted by food safety incidents associated with our restaurants beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015   ” in item 1a “risk factors” in the wake of these incidents strengthening trust among our customers and in our brand has become essential to restoring our business results and achieving our mission this begins with our commitment to serving safe high quality food quality and food safety measures are integrated throughout our supply chain from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line and into our customers’ hands we maintain a limited list of approved suppliers many of which are among the top suppliers in the industry our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs and works closely with our suppliers to ensure our high standards are met throughout the supply chain our training operations and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness employee health protocols and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we not only continue to comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations but establish chipotle as an industry leader in food safety 

while our food safety programs have always been carefully designed and have been in conformance with applicable industry standards over the last year our executive director of food safety a respected expert in the industry has led a comprehensive assessment and enhancement of our food safety programs and practices components of our enhanced food safety programs include 

﻿ 



﻿ 

these and other enhancements underscore our commitment to becoming a leader in food safety while we continue to serve high quality food that our customers love to be sure that our food safety programs continue to evolve in ways that will help maintain leadership in this important area we have established a food safety advisory council that is comprised of some of the nation’s foremost food safety authorities the food safety advisory council is charged with evaluating our programs both in practice and implementation and advising us on ways to elevate our already high standards for food safety 

delivering an excellent guest experience 

there is nothing more important than treating our guests to an excellent experience every time they visit one of our restaurants we believe that restaurants that deliver a consistently great experience attract customers more frequently and engender greater customer loyalty creating an excellent guest experience starts with hiring great people training them on our high standards and creating great teams in our restaurants we have identified 13 characteristics of top performing employees and use these characteristics as a guide to help us identify the very best people for our restaurants then we invest in properly training each employee so that they can seamlessly deliver an excellent experience that our guests will enjoy our restaurant training focuses on the guest experience by ensuring we are serving safe and delicious food quickly in a clean and hospitable environment 

restaurant team each restaurant typically has a general manager or restaurateur a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an apprentice manager in a majority of our restaurants and we aim to have two or three hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 23 full and parttime crew members though our busier restaurants tend to have slightly more employees we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we also crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on 

 

customer service we encourage our general managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes apprentice team leaders team leaders or area managers team directors executive team directors executive regional directors and restaurant support officers 

innovation  we are prioritizing the development of technological and other innovations such as digitalmobile ordering platforms and delivery and catering choices that allow our guests to engage with chipotle in whatever fashion is most convenient for them by allowing our customers to order and receive their food in a variety of ways we believe we can attract more customers and help encourage customers to choose us more frequently in order to successfully deliver a great experience for customers we are emphasizing the optimization of our second makelines which allow us to fulfill catering or online orders without disrupting throughput on our main service line we are also integrating technology into our applications that provides customers with more precise and earlier pickup times which help our restaurants fill digital orders more quickly and accurately improving the experience for customers who use these platforms technological innovations also improve the experience of other guests by helping to improve throughput for those who choose to dine in our restaurants additionally we have enhanced our data capabilities to allow us to better identify individual customers and their unique frequency patterns and to target our marketing and promotional efforts at the individual level we believe the advancements we have made in this area will help us as we continue to target lapsed customers and seek to build frequency among newer customers 

marketing 

a great dining experience in our restaurants has always been our most powerful marketing but there is still a need to introduce our brand to new customers and engage with existing ones in other ways by helping them understand what makes chipotle different our advertising and promotional programs and instore communications all help to communicate what differentiates chipotle from typical fast food whether it’s engaging with chipotle via our various social media channels participating in our local events or simply eating a burrito at one of our restaurants each customer interaction affords us an important opportunity to build our brand on the heels of the safetyrelated incidents we redoubled our efforts to attract customers to our restaurants and to provide a restaurant experience that helps keep them as or convert them into loyal repeat customers generating new customers and enhancing customer frequency will be a central objective of our marketing efforts in 2017 

our advertising has generally included print outdoor transit and radio ads but we also incorporate digital advertising into the mix and conduct strategic promotions that demonstrate our commitment to our food with integrity philosophy while connecting us to likeminded individuals or organizations beyond these traditional channels we continue to pioneer new avenues of branded content aimed at making consumers more curious about some of the issues that are important to us and explaining why and how we are working to drive positive change in the nation’s food supply we also have a dedicated team of field marketing staff that helps connect our restaurants to local communities through fundraisers sponsorships and participation in local events 

alongside our excellent restaurant teams these efforts have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity as our customers learn more about us and share with others this approach allows us to build awareness and loyalty with relatively low advertising expenditures even in a competitive category and to differentiate chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right thing in every facet of our business 

competition 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location brand reputation and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locallyowned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout catering and delivery services in recent years competition has increased significantly from restaurant formats like ours that serve higher quality food quickly and at a reasonable price we believe that this competition has made it more challenging to maintain or increase the frequency of customer visits but continue to believe that chipotle can differentiate itself with our mission to ensure that better food is accessible to everyone 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who seek higherquality food as well as from convenience stores cafeterias and other dining outlets for more information see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry—competition could adversely affect us ” in item 1a “risk factors” we also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees 

 

restaurant site selection   

we believe restaurant site selection is critical to our success and growth strategy and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential restaurant location our site selection process is led by our internal team of real estate managers and also includes the use of external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets as well as support from an internal real estate strategy and research group we study the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and available information on competitors and other restaurants based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment for each potential restaurant site we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as inline or endcap locations in strip or power centers in regional malls and downtown business districts freestanding buildings food courts outlet centers airports military bases and train stations 

other restaurant concepts 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based – finding better ingredients preparing them using classic techniques in front of the customer and serving them in an interactive format with great teams dedicated to providing an excellent dining experience – can be adapted to cuisines other than the food served at chipotle over the previous 5 years we’ve explored this idea by creating new and innovative concepts such as tasty made a burger concept we opened with a single restaurant in october 2016  as well as investing in consolidated entities with partners that are developing additional concepts such as pizzeria locale a fastcasual pizza restaurant that now has seven restaurants in four states our first new restaurant concept was shophouse southeast asian kitchen which we opened in 2011 and grew to a total of 15 restaurants shophouse was not able to achieve a level of sales and profitability that made it attractive to us for future investment and we announced in the fourth quarter of 2016 that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the concept in 2017 our focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand 

information systems   

we use a variety of applications and systems to securely manage the flow of information within each restaurant and within our centralized corporate infrastructure the services available within our systems and applications include restaurant operations supply chain inventory scheduling training human capital management financial tools and data protection services the restaurant structure is based primarily on a pointofsale system that operates locally at the restaurant and is integrated with other functions necessary to restaurant operations it records sales transactions receives out of store orders and authorizes batches and transmits credit card transactions the system also allows employees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of   management reports select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant is collected in the c entral corporate infrastructure which enables management to continually monitor operating results our online ordering system allows guests to place orders online or through our mobile app orders taken remotely are routed to the pointofsales system based on the time of customer order pickup we also continue to modernize and make investments in our information technology networks and infrastructure specifically in our physical and technological security measures to anticipate cyberattacks and prevent breaches and to provide improved control security and scalability enhancing the security of our financial data customer information and other personal information remains a priority for us 

we will continue to invest in our applications and systems to support our continued expansion see “ general business risks — we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information ” in item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of risks associated with our information systems

﻿ 

risks related to our plans to return to sales and profitability growth and restore our economic model 

our sales and profitability will continue to fall well short of our past results unless we can significantly increase comparable restaurant sales and there are material risks to our ability to do so 

in 2016 we experienced lower sales than the precedin g year for the first time in our history as a public company and our average restaurant volumes have declined from 2532 million as of september 30 2015 to 1868 million as of december 31 2016 in order to increase our sales one of our primary goals is to increas e comparable restaurant sales comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation changes in comparable restaurant sales are also a critical factor affecting our profitability because the profit margin on incremental comparable restaurant sales is generally higher due to the sales increases being applied against a partially fixed cost base conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales as we saw throughout the majority of 2016 have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases while we continue to incur a certain level of fixed costs 

our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

﻿ 



﻿ 

these factors most of which are described in more detail in additional risk factors below are beyond our control to at least some degree as a result it is possible that we will experience future declines in comparable restaurant sales or that we otherwise will not achieve our targeted or expected comparable restaurant sales any future declines in comparable restaurant sales or failure to meet market expectations for comparable restaurant sales increases would likely result in a significant adverse impact on the price of our common stock additionally if we fail to significantly increase comparable restaurant sales in 2017 and beyond the price of our common stock is likely to be adver sely impacted 

 

we may continue to be negatively impacted by food safety incidents associated with our restaurants beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 and further instances of foodborne or localized illnesses associated with our restaurants would result in increased negative publicity and further adverse impacts on customer perceptions of our brand which would likely result in further declines in our sales 

during late october and early november 2015 illnesses caused by e coli bacteria were connected to a number of our restaurants initially in washington and oregon and subsequently to small numbers of our restaurants in as many as 12 other states during the week of december 7 2015 an unrelated incident involving norovirus was reported at a chipotle restaurant in brighton massachusetts which worsened the adverse financial and operating impacts we experienced from the earlier e coli incident as a result of these incidents and related publicity our sales and profitability were severely impacted throughout 2016 the significant amount of media coverage regarding these incidents as well as the impact of social media which was not in existence during many past food safety incidents involving other restaurant chains in increasing the awareness of these incidents may continue to negatively impact customer perceptions of our restaurants and brand notwithstanding the high volume of foodborne illness cases from other sources across the country every day as a result it may take longer for our sales to recover than has been the case during past food safety incidents associated with other restaurant chains and we may not fully recover all of our lost sales 

because of customer perceptions in the wake of these food safety incidents any future occurrence of foodborne illness associated with our restaurants—even incidents that may be considered minor at other restaurants—would likely have an even more significant negative impact on our sales and our ability to regain customers although we have followed industry standard food safety protocols in the past and over the past year have enhanced our food safety procedures to ensure that our food is as safe as it can possibly be we may still be at a higher risk for foodborne illness occurrences than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh unprocessed produce and meats our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation and our avoiding frozen ingredients additionally no food safety protocols can completely eliminate the risk of foodborne illness in any restaurant so our enhanced food safety protocols may not be successful in preventing an illness incident in the future the risk of illnesses associated with our food might also increase in connection with an expansion of our catering business or other situations in which our food is served in conditions we cannot control furthermore we have seen instances of unsubstantiated reports linking illnesses to chipotle and these reports have negatively impacted us even if foodborne illnesses are attributed to us erroneously or arise from conditions outside of our control the negative impact from any such illnesses is likely to be significant 

increasing our sales and profits depends in part on our ability to open new restaurants in sites and on terms attractive to us which is subject to many unpredictable factors 

we had 2 250 r estaurants in operation as of december 31 2016 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly and plan to open between 195 and 210 new restaurants in 2017 however we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any one or more of the following factors 

﻿ 



﻿ 

one of our biggest challenges in opening new restaurants is staffing we seek to hire only topperforming employees and to promote general managers from our crew which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open 

 

constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs… ” 

another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for suitable restaurant sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors could negatively impact our ability to manage our occupancy costs which may adversely impact our profitability in addition any of these factors may be exacerbated by economic factors which may result in developers and contractors seeing increased demand and therefore driving our construction and leasing costs up 

any decision to delay or forego a significant number of new restaurant openings or our inability to open the number of new restaurants we plan due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our existing restaurant base will decline making it increasingly difficult to achieve levels of sales and profitability growth that we achieved prior to 2016 

our progress in ope ning new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods similarly our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generate sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area which can result in lower initial sales volumes following a restaurant’s opening it may also be difficult for us to attract a customer base if we are not able to staff our restaurants with top performing employees and successfully train them to deliver excellent customer experiences if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable our new restaurant sales volumes since the fourth quarter of 2015 have also been negatively impacted by the food safety issues described elsewhere in this report the negative impact has been of greater relative magnitude to the impact we have seen on comparable restaurant sales and as a result new restaurant sales may have an even larger adverse impact on our results than they have in the past 

our new restaurant development activity has also broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or types of restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and restaurants in airports food courts or on military sites the risks relating to building a customer base and managing development and operating costs may be more significant in some or all of these types of trade areas or restaurant sites which could have an unexpected negative impact on our new restaurant operating results in addition in the event we are not able to contain increases in our average restaurant development costs which could result from inflation an increase in the proportion of higher cost locations project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability 

we have also opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market 

our marketing and advertising strategies may not be successful or may pose risks that could adversely impact our business 

in an effort to reverse the downturn in our business results that began in late 2015 we significantly increased marketing and promotional expense in 2016 for the year ended december 31 2016 our marketing and promotional expense wa s 51 of revenue si gnificantly higher than the 21 of revenue it had averaged over the preceding three years in 2017 we expect to return marketing and promotional expense to levels closer to our historical practice as a percent of revenue and doing so may adversely impact the number of customers visiting our restaurants if so we may be forced to engage in additional promotional activities including further offers for free or discounted food which may hamper our sales and profitability 

as part of our marketing plans for 2017 we have hired a new advertising agency and media buyer and are also introducing a new advertising campaign and media strategies including the possibility of television advertising which we began testing for the first time in 2016 if our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customers in the manner we hope they may 

 

not result in increased sales but would still increase our expenses additionally we will also continue to invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will increase customers’ connection with our brand if these marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant sales the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect 

we also plan to continue to emphasize strategies such as remote ordering and catering options in an effort to increase overall sales these efforts may not increase our sales to the degree we expect or at all catering and other outofrestaurant sales options also introduce new operating procedures to our restaurants and we may not successfully execute these procedures which could adversely impact the customer experience in our restaurants and thereby harm our sales and customer perceptions of our brand 

in addition some of our marketing has incorporated elements intended to encourage customers to question sources or production methods commonly used to produce food these elements of our marketing could alienate food suppliers and other food industry groups and may potentially lead to an increased risk of disputes or litigation if suppliers or other constituencies believe our marketing is unfair or misleading increased costs in connection with any such issues or any deterioration in our relationships with existing suppliers could adversely impact us or our reputation furthermore if these messages do not resonate with our customers or potential customers the value of our brand may be eroded 

our expansion into international markets may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors 

as of december 31 2016 29 of our restaurants were locate d outside of the us with 17 in canada 6 in the united kingdom 5 in f rance and 1 in frankfurt germany as a result of our small number of restaurants outside the us and the relatively short time we have been operating those restaurants we have lower brand awareness and less operating experience in these markets and our average restaurant sales andor transaction counts may be lower in these markets than in the us the markets in which we’ve opened restaurants outside the us and any additional new markets we enter outside the us in the future have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our us markets as a result new restaurants outside the us may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets specifically due to lower consumer familiarity with the chipotle brand differences in customer tastes or spending patterns or for other reasons sales at restaurants opened outside the us may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall growth and profitability we have also seen some deterioration in sales trends at our international locations since late 2015 which we believe may be attributable to expanding awareness of the foodborne illness incidents described elsewhere in this report and those trends may make it more difficult to attract customers to our restaurants in international markets to build brand awareness in international markets we may need to make greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations in those markets 

we may also find it more difficult in international markets to hire train and keep top performing employees who can successfully deliver excellent customer experiences and labor costs may be higher in international markets due to increased regulation higher employment taxes or social benefit costs or local market conditions in addition restaurants outside the us have had higher construction occupancy and food costs than restaurants in existing markets and we may have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards additional costs or difficulties from any of the foregoing factors may adversely impact the operating results of our international markets markets outside the us may also have regulatory differences with the us with which we are not familiar or that subject us to significant additional expense or to which we are not able to successfully adapt which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could adversely impact our overall results our overall results may also be negatively affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar 

pizzeria locale tasty made and other new restaurant concepts may not contribute to our growth 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based – finding better ingredients preparing them using classic techniques in front of the customer and serving them in an interactive format with great teams dedicated to providing an excellent dining experience – can be adapted to cuisines other than the food served at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened a number of shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants beginning in 2011 and one tasty made burger restaurant in ohio in 2016 we also have a majority ownership interest in a company operating 7 fast casual pizzeria locale restaurants in denver colorado kansas city missouri and cincinnati ohio and we plan to assist with the further expansion of pizzeria locale in the future shophouse was not able to achieve a level of sales and profitability that made it attractive to us for future investment and we announced in the fourth quarter of 2016 that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the concept we recognized a 145 million noncash impairment charge representing substantially all of the value of longlived assets of shophouse during the year ended december 31 2016 furthermore pizzeria locale and tasty made are 

 

new brands and have lower brand awareness lower sales and less operating experience than most chipotle restaurants and may also not achieve restaurant economics that make them attractive for further investment in the future notwithstanding our growth plans for tasty made our investment in pizzeria locale and exploration of other restaurant brand opportunities our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand as a result we do not expect pizzeria locale tasty made or other concepts to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years we may also determine not to move forward with any further expansion of tasty made or pizzeria locale these decisions would each limit our overall growth over the long term as well additionally the exploration of strategic alternatives for shophouse the expansion of tasty made or pizzeria locale or investments in other restaurant concepts each might distract our management which could have an adverse impact on our core chipotle business 

our failure to manage our restaurant growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

as described elsewhere in this report our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls information systems and personnel may be inadequate to support our expansion and managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls as well as to hire train and retain general managers crew and corporate staff we also are continuing to attempt to improve our field management in an effort to develop additional topperforming general managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our restaurant growth imposes on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate we have also historically placed a great deal of importance on restaurant cultures which we believe needs to be redirected to focus more on effective training of our team to deliver excellent customer experiences as we grow our number of restaurants additional shifts in our cultural or operational focus may harm morale in our restaurants or prove distracting to our restaurant employees which could adversely impact our business and operating results 

risks related to operating in the restaurant industry 

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location brand reputation and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout and d elivery services in recent years competition has increased significantly from restaurant formats like ours that serve higher quality food quickly at a reasonable price we believe that this competition has made it more challenging to maintain or increase the frequency of customer visits  additionally although we continue to believe that chipotle can differentiate itself with our mission to ensure that better food is accessible to everyone  competitors have increasingly made claims related to the quality of their ingredients or distinctions between artificial and natural flavors colors and preservatives the increasing use of these claims in the marketplace even if the substantive basis for some of them may be questionable may lessen our differentiation 

many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a num ber of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally some of these competitors and other fast casual concepts have sought to duplicate various elements of our business operations and more chains may copy us to varying degrees in the future additionally our newer concepts tasty made and pizzeria locale operate in markets in which there are numerous competitors including a number of large and wellknown brands a number of other companies or individuals in the restaurant industry have recently opened or invested in fastcasual pizza concepts or socalled “better burger” restaurants in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these and other competing products or by price competition more generally 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and other dining outlets these competitors may have among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs and prices better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding and retaining topperforming employees 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our general managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors such as competition for workers and labor market pressures increased minimum wage requirements paid sick leave or vacation accrual mandates or changes in our restaurant staffing structure have and may continue to adversely impact our operating costs additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits costs including the requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act or the affordable care act discussed further under “ regulatory and legal risks — the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs… ” could also adversely impact our labor costs moreover if our managers do not schedule our restaurant crews efficiently our restaurants may be overstaffed at some times which adversely impacts our labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreasing our operating margins efficient staffing may continue to be a challenge in 2017 due to continued volatility and uncertainty in our sales trends 

in addition our success in delivering excellent customer experiences depends substantially on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees especially general managers and crew members turnover among our restaurant crews and managers has been frequent and we aim to reduce turnover in an effort to keep top performing employees and better realize our investment in training new employees failure to do so will adversely impact our operating results by increasing training costs and making it more difficult to deliver outstanding customer experiences our failure to find and keep enough highcaliber employees could also delay planned restaurant openings which would slow our growth 

we use the “everify” program an internetbased free program run by the us government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company however use of everify does not guarantee that we will successfully identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment although we use everify and require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if we are found to be employing unauthorized workers we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees for example following an audit by the department of homeland security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota during 2010 we lost approximately 450 employees resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations including slower throughput as we trained new employees as well as some degree of negative publicity the resulting broadbased civil and criminal investigations by the us attorney for the district of columbia and us securities and exchange commission of our compliance with work authorization requirements and related disclosures and statements resulted in significant legal costs termination of a significant number of employees in specific markets or across our company due to work authorization or other regulatory issues would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees we could also become subject to fines penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors furthermore immigration laws have been an area of considerable political focus in recent years and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs further changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and potential liability and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees 

because we do not franchise risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring payment and termination of employees and employeerelated litigation may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions global demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and cooking oils has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice in 2016 a significant spike in avocado prices from september to november adversely impacted our food costs for the third and fourth quarters and there could be similar or greater pricing pressure on key ingre dients 

 

during 2017 costs have increased from the enhanced food safety procedures described elsewhere in this report  additionally a substantial volume of produce items are grown in mexico and other countries and some of our meats and restaurant supplies are sourced from outside the us as well any new or increased import duties tariffs or taxes or other changes in us trade or tax policy could result in higher food and supply costs that would adversely impact our financial results 

we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and animal welfare criteria or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for food products that are conventionally raised and grown weather related issues such as freezes or drought may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as produce or meats for instance drought conditions in parts of the us resulted in significant increases in beef prices during 2014 and 2015 increasing weather volatility or other longterm changes in global weather patterns including any changes associated with global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales and could also have an adverse impact on our brand 

food scares could adversely affect customer perceptions of or the price or availability of ingredients we use to prepare our food which may adversely impact our sales 

past reports linking nationwide or regional incidents of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella e coli hepatitis a listeria or norovirus to certain produce items have caused us to temporarily suspend serving some ingredients in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu and have resulted in consumers avoiding certain products for a period of time similarly outbreaks of avian flu incidents of “mad cow” disease or similar concerns have also caused consumers to avoid any products that are or are suspected of being affected these problems and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse effect on the price and availability of affected ingredients a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants due to the types of food scares described above would further adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability in addition if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient or operating costs resulting from supply problems or operational changes associated with incidents of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

changes we have made in our operations or that we make in the future to further enhance the safety of the food we serve will adversely impact our financial performance and may negatively impact customer perception of our brand 

as a result of the food safety incidents described elsewhere in this report we have implemented a number of enhancements to our food safety protocols to ensure that our food is as safe as it can be many of our enhanced procedures which go beyond the industrystandard food safety practices that we were previously following increase the cost of some ingredients or the amount of labor required to prepare and serve our food if we aren’t able to sufficiently increase sales to offset the increased costs resulting from these changes our margins will fall well short of levels we have historically achieved even if we were to restore sales to levels we were achieving prior to the fourth quarter of 2015 the increased costs from these changes are likely to result in lower margins than we were able to achieve in the past 

additionally some of the enhanced food safety procedures we have introduced or may introduce in the future rely on increased use of centralized food preparation additional inrestaurant preparation steps or new ingredients some or all of which may be inconsistent with previous customer perceptions of our restaurant operations to the extent customers perceive any of these developments as a move away from our food with integrity strategy andor towards a more traditional fast food experience our ability to win back customers may be adversely impacted and our sales may decline or recover more slowly than they otherwise would have 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination which we may detect more frequently under the microbiological testing protocols we’ve recently 

 

introduced inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or deciding not to follow our required protocols or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations in particular shortages of one or more of our menu items could force our restaurants to remove items from their menus which may result in customers choosing to eat elsewhere if that happens our affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the menu item shortage and potentially thereafter if customers do not return to us after the shortage is resolved our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe to us than at other restaurants 

for many of our food ingredients and other supplies we do not have longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on a third party distribution network with a limited number of distribution partners if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason the risk of ingredient shortages may increase and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken tofu beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our food with integrity suppliers and as described in more detail below under “ risks related to our unique business strategy — our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks ” these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

in the first quarter of 2015 through our ongoing auditing of suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards and suspended purchases of pork from this supplier without this supply we did not have enough pork meeting our specifications for all of our restaurants and a large number of our restaurants were not serving carnitas for a number of months during 2015 we believe our comparable restaurant sales were adversely impacted as a result as customers chose to eat elsewhere rather than substituting a different one of our menu items for carnitas 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods and our focus on a limited menu could make the consequences of a change in consumer preferences more severe than our competitors may face some customers could also avoid freshlyprepared foods like those we serve based on concerns regarding food safety this may be more likely to impact us as a result of the widelypublicized food safety incidents we experienced in 2015 

our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels our average restaurant sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty which can be caused by various factors such as high unemployment increasing taxes interest rates or other changes in fiscal or monetary policy high gasoline prices declining home prices tight credit markets or foreign political or economic unrest any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

if we were to experience widespread difficulty renewing existing leases on favorable terms our revenue or occupancy costs could be adversely affected 

we lease substantially all of the properties on which we operate restaurants and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value which could involve substantial increases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals could adversely impact us if we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants conversely substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs reducing our restaurant margins 

 

risks related to our unique business strategy 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice restaurant segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create additionally it will likely be more difficult for us to persuade the public about the quality and value of our food following the foodborne illnesses we experienced in 2015 and the associated deterioration of customer perceptions about our brand and we cannot predict when those perceptions will improve if ever if customers are not persuaded that we offer a good value for their money our restaurant transaction counts could be adversely affected which would negatively impact our business results 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

the principle of food with integrity constitutes a significant part of our business strategy we use a substantial amount of ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on practices we believe to be more sustainable or responsible than some conventional practices and we try to make our food as fresh as we can we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity philosophy there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are more responsible farming practices as well as uncertainty regarding demand due to changing customer perceptions economic trends and other factors many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area although all of our restaurants generally serve meat from animals raised in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we may experience shortages of meat meeting these criteria due to suppliers suspending production market conditions or other forces beyond our control in the first quarter of 2015 through our ongoing auditing of suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards and suspended purchases of pork from this supplier without this supply we did not have enough pork meeting our specifications for all of our restaurants and a large number of our restaurants were not serving carnitas for a number of months during 2015 we believe our comparable restaurant sales were adversely impacted as a result we have experienced shortages of beef or chicken meeting our protocols on a periodic basis over the past several years as well resulting in our serving commodity beef and chicken which may have a negative impact on customer perceptions of our brand 

if as a result of any of the factors described above we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of our preferred ingredients on a costeffective basis our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with our food with integrity philosophy which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline our commitment to the food with integrity philosophy may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our food with integrity approach any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants we may also face adverse publicity or liability for false advertising claims if suppliers do not adhere to all of the elements of our food with integrity programs such as responsible meat protocols requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods our use of nongmo ingredients in our food and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions if any such supplier failures occur and are publicized our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted and our food with integrity message may result in customers holding us to a higher standard in terms of food safety as well which may make it more difficult for us to recover from the foodborne illness incidents discussed elsewhere in this report as customers who believe we failed to uphold our own standards may decline to return to our restaurants as frequently or at all 

additionally in response to increasing customer awareness and demand some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones dairy products from cows not treated with rbgh and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our food with integrity philosophy if competitors become known for using these types of higherquality or more sustainable ingredients it could further limit our supply of these ingredients and may make it more difficult for us to differentiate chipotle and our restaurants which could adversely impact our operating results 

 

our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel and recent changes in our management team may adversely impact us 

our chairman and chief executive officer steve ells founded our company has been the principal architect of our business strategy and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 2000 restaurants today monty moran who served as our cochief executive officer for over 11 years before announcing his retirement in december 2016 and jack hartung our chief financial officer have also served with us since early in our company’s history and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well additionally mark crumpacker our chief marketing and development officer who has played a role in our marketing and branding efforts for many years and who has been an executive officer since joining us full time in january 2009 has been instrumental in formulating strategies to help us regain customers following the sales declines we experienced throughout 2016 curt garner who joined us as chief information officer in november 2015 has had a key role in developing and executing our digitalmobile ordering platforms and strategy and we believe these and other technology innovations will become increasingly important in helping us return to sales and profitability growth we believe our executive officers each of whom is an atwill employee without any employment contract have created an employee culture food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team we also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision monty moran’s resignation from the cochief executive officer position in connection with his planned retirement was the first change in our executive officer team in a number of years if our company culture or operations were to deteriorate following this or other changes in leadership or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted 

regulatory and legal risks 

governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs 

employment and immigration regulations 

we are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules and antidiscrimination laws complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for noncompliance for example a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee classification employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we incur legal costs to defend and we could suffer losses from these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant in addition several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases changes to eligibility for overtime pay paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs in addition see “— the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs… ” below for a discussion of risks related to recent changes in us healthcare laws 

we also are audited from time to time for compliance with work authorization requirements and audit activity and federal criminal and civil investigations in this area are described in more detail above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding and retaining topperforming employees ” as well as in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees on the other hand in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants we could be found to be in violation of antidiscrimination laws we could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance antidiscrimination compliance or both that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees moreover in addition to the criminal and civil investigations mentioned above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding and retaining topperforming employees ” the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia and the us securities and exchange commission investigated us for possible criminal and civil securities law violations relating to our employee work authorization compliance and related disclosures and statements as well any potential future investigations in this area may be expensive and distracting and could subject us to fines reputational damage and other liabilities that could be significant 

 

additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize our employees and those of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to topperforming employees could be impaired potential changes in labor laws including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture 

americans with disabilities act and similar state laws 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act or ada and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we have incurred substantial legal fees in connection with adarelated complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws the expenses associated with these modifications or any damages legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ada or similar state laws could be material 

nutrition and food regulation 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and a number of other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available and nationwide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the us health care reform law are scheduled to go into effect on may 5 2017 these nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales and could subject us to liability if we make errors in calculating or disclosing the required information 

privacycybersecurity 

we are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is evolving and increasingly demanding at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf if our security and information systems or those of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees additional risks related to cybersecurity are described below under “ general business riskswe may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information ” 

local licensure zoning and other regulation 

each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

environmental laws 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner or 

 

operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

other aspects of regulatory risk 

from time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various laws and regulations that cover our business much of this litigation occurs in california even though currently only about 17 of our restaurants are located there as we continue to expand in california or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in california our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in or minimized our operations in california 

because we do not franchise the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business as described above may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

regulatory actions and litigation related to food safety incidents that impacted us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 may adversely impact us 

we are facing ongoing government investigations into the food safety incidents that occurred in 2015 including the criminal investigation described in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we also have received numerous claims from customers who were or claim to have been impacted by these incidents and a number of those claimants have filed lawsuits against us we are cooperating in the government investigations and with many of the customers impacted by these incidents but will incur significant legal and other costs in doing so we have also been sued in a shareholder class action lawsuit in connection with the decline in our stock price in the wake of the food safety incidents and defending this lawsuit will subject us to significant legal expense additionally the liabilities from customer claims and related litigation expenses may be greater than we anticipate due to the uncertainties inherent in litigation all of these costs liabilities and expenses will negatively impact our operating results moreover publicity regarding any legal proceedings related to food safety incidents may increase or prolong consumer awareness of the incidents or otherwise negatively impact perceptions of our brand which may hamper our ability to regain lost sales or attract new customers to our restaurants 

the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results 

we offer eligible fulltime and parttime us employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us for various reasons many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans however under the comprehensive us health care reform law enacted in 2010 the affordable care act changes that became effective in 2014 and especially the employer mandate and employer penalties that became effective january 1 2015 may increase our labor costs significantly in future years in 2015 we adopted a qualifying plan under the affordable care act for our fulltime hourly employees changes under the affordable care act including the imposition of a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage may result in employees who are currently eligible but have not elected to participate in our healthcare plans increasingly finding it advantageous to do so which may increase our healthcare costs in the future which may further increase our healthcare expenses it is also possible that even in light of recent changes in the healthcare plans we offer healthcare plans offered by other companies with which we compete for employees will make us less attractive to our current or potential employees and in any event implementing the requirements of the affordable care act has imposed some additional administrative costs on us and those costs may increase over time the costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

we’re subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters including wages work hours overtime vacation and family leave discrimination wrongful termination and similar matters and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future our customers also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we’re responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices 

 

see “— governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs ” above for additional discussion of these types of claims from time to time we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertising practices we have been subject to a number of these actions and may be subject to additional actions of this type in the future we are also undergoing government investigations and have been sued in a shareholder class action lawsuit each as described elsewhere in this report including in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and these matters may be particularly expensive to defend andor resolve 

we believe the number of many of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers particularly in california regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we’re ultimately held liable for such claims they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations whether directed at us or at fast casual or quickservice restaurants generally may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects which in turn could adversely affect our results 

general business risks 

we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2016 approximately 70 of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen including a number of highly publicized incidents with wellknown retailers in recent years in august 2004 the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data as a result we recorded losses and related expenses totaling 43 million from 2004 through 2006 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects the liabilities resulting from any of the foregoing would likely be far greater than the losses we recorded in connection with the data breach incident in 2004 

we also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf we have seen an increase over the past several years in the frequency and sophistication of attempts to compromise the security of several of these systems if the security and information systems that we or our outsourced third party providers use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees 

negative publicity relating to our restaurants or our company could adversely impact our reputation which may significantly harm us 

we depend significantly on customers’ perception of and connection to our brand in addition to the damage to our reputation from wellpublicized food safety incidents during 2015 as described elsewhere in this report we may experience negative publicity from time to time relating to food quality customer complaints restaurant facilities advertising and other business practices litigation alleging injuries or improper employee practices government investigations or other regulatory issues our suppliers’ potential failure to adhere to elements of our food with integrity protocols other issues regarding the integrity of our suppliers’ food processing 

 

employee relationships customer or employee data breaches or other matters regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held to be responsible the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one or more restaurants or any of the foregoing topics may extend far beyond the restaurants involved and affect many more or even all of our restaurants the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated a similar risk exists with respect to unrelated food service businesses if consumers associate those businesses with our own operations and even publicity that could reasonably be viewed as positive may have adverse consequences on our business for example positive developments in regards to the food safety issues that have impacted us might have the effect of continuing or increasing customer awareness of the issue 

the adverse impact of publicity on customers’ perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales if the impact of any such publicity is particularly longlasting the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished additionally negative publicity about our employment practices may affect our reputation among employees and potential employees which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain topperforming employees that could adversely impact the quality of the customer experience we can offer and our operations generally and may increase our labor costs as well 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability property damage and auto liability we are selfinsured for our employee health plans but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability property damage employment practices liability and auto liability insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is relatively short and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations it is also possible that losses covered under one or more of our insurance policies may exceed the applicable policy limits which would subject us to unexpected additional liabilities in an amount that could be significant enough to have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos our food with integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quart erly results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors because of factors including 

﻿ 

 

 



﻿ 

seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading days—that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall this risk may continue to be a greater concern during 2017 as the expectations of analysts and investors of a recovery in our business results may be higher than any level of recovery that we do actually achieve 

additionally we believe the market price of our common stock which has generally traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most or all of our peer companies has typically reflected high market expectations for our future operating results the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times as well including during 2016 as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion together with item 6 “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the discussion contains forwardlooking statements involving risks uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations factors that might cause such differences include those described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

overview 

steve ells our founder chairman and ceo started chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience today chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls and salads made from fresh highquality raw ingredients prepared using classic cooking methods and served in an interactive style allowing people to get what they want chipotle seeks out extraordinary ingredients that are not only fresh but that are raised responsibly with respect for the animals land and people who produce them chipotle prepares its food using whole unprocessed ingredients and without the use of added colors flavors or other additives typically found in fast food chipotle opened with a single restaurant in denver in 1993 and as of december 31 2016 operated 2250 restaurants 

our focus during 2017 is to return to sales and profitability growth and restore our restaurant economic model to do so we have a renewed focus on ensuring that every guest in every one of our restaurants is provided with an excellent customer experience 

201 6 highlights and trends 

operating results our sales and profitability were adversely impacted throughout 2016 as a result of a number of foodborne illness incidents associated with chipotle restaurants in as many as 15 states which were widely reported during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 our comparable restaurant sales trends have improved sequentially for each quarter during 2016 as shown below 

﻿ 



﻿ 

our sales comparisons were lapping an easier compare in the fourth quarter due to lower sales levels in november and december 2015 as a result of the foodborne illness incidents comparable restaurant sales decreases were driven primarily by a 144 decrease in the number of transactions for the full year 2016 and to a lesser extent by decreases in average check comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation average restaurant sales were 1868 million as of december 31 2016 decreasing from 2424 million as of december 31 2015 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months 

during the full year 2016 our restaurant operating costs food beverage and packaging labor occupancy and other operating costs as a percent of revenue increased 133 as compared to the full year 2015 about 62 of the increase was attributable to sales deleveraging while incremental marketing and promotional spend aimed at regaining our customers combined with additional labor to support the sales promotions contributed about 31 to the increase additionally a s part of our response to the foodborne illness incidents we have implemented enhanced food safety procedures in our supply chain and restaurants that have increased our food costs as a percentage of revenue we anticipate that the ongoing impact of the enhanced food safety procedures on our food costs as a percentage of revenue will be approximately 1 compared to precrisis levels 

restaurant development  as of december 31 201 6  we had 2250 restaurants in operation including 2198 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states with an additional 29 international chipotle restaurants and 23 nonchipotle restaurants that were consolidated into our financial results   w e opened 240 restaurants in 201 6 net of relocations and closures which contributed 1562 million to revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives for our 15 shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants and as a result we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 145 million 

 

stock repurchases in accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors  we purchased shares of our common stock during 2016 with an aggregate total repurchase price of 8139 million as of december 31 201 6  1026 million was available for stock repurchases under the authorization s announced on may 11 2016 and october 25 2016  on january 10 2017 we also announced authorizations by our board of directors of up to an additional 100 million in common stock repurchases we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b51c authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time subject to market conditions the existing repurchase agreement and the board’s authorization s of the repurchases may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

management and governance enhancements  in the fourth quarter of 2016 we announced that our board of directors named steve ells as our sole chief executive officer and that monty moran formerly our cochief executive officer had stepped down from his officer and board positions and will retire effective june 9 2017 on december 19 2016 we also announced the appointment of four new members to our board of directors two of whom were nominated by pershing square capital management lp which together with its affiliates we believe to be our largest shareholder 

2017 outlook 

sales we are targeting comparable restaurant sales increases in the high single digits for the full year 2017 as comparisons become easier in the first half of 2017 and based on our plans to attract more customers with a variety of marketing activities and improvements to our digital ordering platforms and by improving the quality of the customer experience we provide in our restaurants 

restaurant operating costs we expect to reduce restaurant level operating costs as a percent of revenue for the full year 2017 our expectation is based in part on the increased sales we are anticipating and the resulting leverage in fixed operating costs but we are forecasting additional improvements as well we expect food beverage and packaging costs to decrease as a percent of revenue due to relief in avocado prices and more efficient food management we also believe that other operating expenses will decline compared to 2016 as we reduce marketing and promotional spend as a percent of revenue from the elevated levels of 2016 although we still plan for these expenses in 2017 to be above historical levels 

other expense items and restaurant development plans we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in 2017 due to higher noncash stockbased compensation expense and higher bonuses although underlying general and administrative expenses for the year should remain relatively consistent with 2016 the expected increase in stock based compensation is primarily a result of lower expense in 2016 due to an expense reversal for performancebased stock awards that did not vest as well as higher expense in 2017 due to a planned retention award for nonexecutive employees and broadening the group of nonexecutive employees eligible for awards we expect to realize cost efficiencies in the development of our restaurants in 2017 by simplifying our restaurant design and choosing real estate sites such as endcaps that can more easily and costefficiently be converted into chipotle restaurants we intend to open between 195 and 210 restaurants for the full year 2017 most of our 2017 restaurant openings are planned in markets that are proven or already have a chipotle presence established 

tax rates we expect the 2017 full year effective tax rate to be between 390 and 395 however as discussed in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the adoption of asu no 201609 “compensationstock compensation topic 718” will subject our tax rate to quarterly volatility from the effect of stock award exercise and vesting activities

results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section 

﻿ 

 

revenue 



in 201 6  t he decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in comparable restaurant sales partially offset by new restaurant openings   c omparable restaurant sales decreased  9147 million while revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed  3239 million of which  1562 million w as attributable to restaurants opened in 2016   

in 201 5  increased revenue   was primarily driven by new restaurant openings revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed 3904 million of the increase in sales in 201 5  of which 1836 million was attributable to restaurants opened during 2015  

food beverage and packaging costs   



food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 201 6 primarily due to   increased waste and costs related to new food safety procedures as well as higher avocado prices  partially offset by relief in beef prices in dollar terms food beverage an d packaging costs decreased in 2016 due to lower sales 

food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 201 5 primarily due to the benefit of the nationwide me nu price increases taken in the second quarter of 2014 and relief in dairy and avocado costs the decrease was partial ly offset by inflation on beef costs 

labor costs   



labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 201 6 due primarily to sales deleveraging and wage inflation  partially offset by labor efficiencies resulting from fewer managers and crew in each of our restaurants although we incurred additional costs to staff our restaurants for sales promotions during 2016 those incremental costs were offset by the improvement from 2015 when we incurred scheduling in efficiencies as a result of reporting challenges from a system change in early 2015  labor costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31 2016 due to staffing needs for new restaurants  

labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 201 5 compared to full year 2014 due primarily to wage inflation and an increased number of crew and managers in each of our restaurants caused by scheduling inefficiencies occurring earlier in the year   

 

occupancy costs   



occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 201 6 primarily due to lower average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base  o ccupancy costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 3 1  2016 primarily due to costs associated with new restaurants 

in 201 5  occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to higher average rents for new locations  

other operating costs   



other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs bank and credit card fees and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs other operating c osts increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due primarily to higher ma rketing and promotional expense as well as sales deleveraging   we increased our marketing and promotional spend in an effort to regain customers which contributed  982 million to the increase  

other operating costs in creased as a percentage of revenue in 201 5 due primarily to a change in the classification of kitchen gloves out of food beverage and packaging costs beginning in 2015 and higher marketing and promotional costs 

general and administrative expenses   



the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms for 201 6 primarily resulted from increased legal expense higher payroll costs as we grew and expense s associated with our biennial all managers’ conference held during 201 6 partially offset by   lower   bonus expense and travel costs 

the decrease in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 201 5 primarily resulted from decreased noncash stockbased compensation expense lower bonus expense and decreased expense associated with our biennial all managers’ conference   held during 20 14 partially offset by higher payroll costs as we grew stockbased compensation expense decreased 394 million primarily due to a change in the structure of our executive compensation as well as a decrease in our estimate of nonvested performance stock awards that we expect to vest 

 

depreciation and amortization   



depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due to   sales deleveraging  the increase in dollar terms was due primarily to depreciation and amortization costs associated with new restaurants 

in 201 5  depreciation and a mortization in creased as a percentage of revenue due to reinvestment costs for our restaurants as they age 

loss on disposal of assets 



loss on disposal and impairment of assets increased in 201 6   primarily due to   a noncash impairment charge of 145 million to writedown substantially all of the value of the longlived assets of our shophouse restaurants  

loss on disposal of assets increased in 201 5 due to impairment charges resulting from an internally developed software program that we chose not to implement and related hardware the discontinued use of certain kitchen equipment as well as restaurant relocations  

income tax provision 



the 2016 effective tax rate was higher due to a higher state tax rate not qualifying for the federal research and development tax credit in 2016 and nondeductible items on overall lower pretax operating income the 2015 effective tax rate was higher than 2014 due primarily to 2014 benefiting from filing the 2013 tax returns which included a nonrecurring change in the estimate of usable employer credits 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2016 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter results from the quarter ended december 31 2015 and for each quarter in 2016 include the impact of the foodborne illness incidents described elsewhere in this report 

 

﻿ 



seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results such as the adverse publicity that we saw beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 around foodborne illness incidents associated with our restaurants as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases the number of trading days in a quart er can also affect our results although on an overall annual basis changes in trading da y s do not have a significant impact   

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of noncash stockbased compensation expense the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter  anticipated and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs as of december 31 2016 we had a cash and shortterm investment balance of 4177 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions  to maintain our existing restaurants and f or general corporate purposes as of december 31 2016 there was 1026 million remaining available under repurchase authorizations previously approved by our board of directors on january 10 2017 we announced authorizations by our board of directors of up to an additional 100 million in common stock repurchases we also have a long term investments balance of 1251 million which consists of us treasury notes with maturities of up to 15 months  we believe that cash from operations together with our cash and investment balances will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

 

o ne of our primary uses of cash is in new restaurant development our total capital expen ditures for 2016 were 2588 million and we expect to incur cap ital expenditures of about 224 million in 201 7  of w hich about 170 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments  information technology and infrastructure initiatives and other corporate expenses  our expected reduction in capital expenditures is due to fewer planned restaurant openings and lower average investment costs per restaurant in 2017   in 2016 we spent on average about 880000 in development and construction costs per restaurant or about 790000 net of landlord reimbursements of 90000 for new restaurants to be opened in 201 7  we anticipate average development costs will decrease due to cost savings initiatives  

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 201 6 were as follows 



  

1 we enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed for orders related to produce and other ingredients and supplies construction contractor and subcontractor agreements orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships 

the majority of our restau rants and administrative office leases are noncancelable obligations  our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 1 0 to 15 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 201 6 and 201 5  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor healthcare costs fuel utility costs materials used in the construction of our restaurants and insurance although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level  additionally many of our leases require us to pay property taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases there have been and there may be in the future delays in implementing such menu price increases if we do raise menu prices in the future general competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our signific ant accounting policies in note 1  “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” and note 6  “stock based compensation” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumpt ions or factors we believe that of our critical accounting estimates the following involve a higher degree of judgement and subjectivity   

 

leases 

we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straightline basis over the reasonably assured lease term the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights or sosars and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards and sosars with performancebased vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different awards that contain service performance and market conditions ultimately vest based on chipotle’s relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in the annual average s of revenue growth net income growth and total shareholder return our estimates of chipotle’s future performance and the future perfo rmance of the restaurant industry peer group are assumptions that involve a high degree of subjectivity if we had arrived at different assumptions for revenue growth or net income for chipotle or the peer group our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different   

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for workers’ compensation general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as 1 million per incident and for property which generally has a 15 million per incident deductible we are selfinsured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is relatively short and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2016 were 494 million 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequen tly we were unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2016  although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

commodity price risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food our packaging materials as well as utilities to run our restaurants are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices however a majority of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 24 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance 

changing interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 201 6  we had 5005 million in investments and interestbearing cas h accounts including insurance related restricted trust account s classified in other assets and 376 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 071  

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date

 item 1 business 

general 

chipotle mexican grill inc a delaware corporation together with its subsidiaries “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operates chipotle mexican grill restaurants which serve a focused menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads made using fresh ingredients as of december 31 2015 we operated 1971 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states as well as 11 in canada seven in england four in france and one in germany additionally our restaurants included 13 shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants serving asianinspired cuisine and we are an investor in a consolidated entity that owned and operated three pizzeria locale restaurants a fast casual pizza concept resulting in a total of 2010 restaurants as of december 31 2015 we focus on finding the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on building a special people culture that is centered on creating a team of top performers empowered to achieve high standards on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with the highest regard for the safety of our customers and increasing awareness and respect for the environment we have grown substantially over the past five years and expect to open between 220 and 235 additional restaurants in 2016 including a small number of chipotle restaurants outside the us and shophouse and pizzeria locale restaurants within the us 

our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

we manage our operations and restaurants based on nine regions that aggregate into one reportable segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 and our total assets as of december 31 2015 and 2014 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the us for a discussion of risks related to our international operations see “ risks related to our growth strategy and future 

 

expansion – our expansion into international markets may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

our menu and food preparation 

quality assurance and food safety   we are committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety measures are found throughout our supply chain from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs for our supply chain our training operations and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations 

while our food safety programs have always been carefully designed and have been in conformance with applicable industry standards in response to food safety incidents during 2015 that impacted hundreds of customers we have recently undertaken a comprehensive assessment of our food safety programs and practices using the assistance of highly respected experts we performed a review of the ingredients we use with a goal of designing an industryleading food safety program components of the new program include dnabased testing of many ingredients designed to ensure the quality and safety of ingredients before they are shipped to our restaurants changes to food preparation and food handling practices including washing and cutting some produce items such as tomatoes and romaine lettuce in central kitchens blanching of some produce items including avocados onions jalapenos and citrus in our restaurants before cutting them and new protocols for marinating meats we are also working to enhance our internal controls surrounding food safety by utilizing the food and drug administration’s hazard analysis critical control point haccp management system additionally we are focused on internal training programs to ensure that all employees thoroughly understand our high standards for food safety and food handling and we offer paid sick leave to employees to reduce incentives for employees to work while sick these and other enhancements underscore our commitment to becoming a leader in food safety while we continue to serve high quality food that our customers love 

food with integrity serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food as part of our food with integrity philosophy we believe that purchasing fresh ingredients is not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on the sources of each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food 

i n all of our restaurants  we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of non therapeutic antibiotics or added hormones and in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we brand these meats as “responsibly raised tm ”   one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to serve meats raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so for example some of our restaurants did not serve carnitas for a portion of 2015 and some of our restaurants served conventionally raised chicken for periods during 2015 due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised meats more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats or stop serving one or more menu items in the future due to additional supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

we also seek to use more responsibly grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees a portion of our beans is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown a portion of some of the other produce items we serve is organically grown as well our commitment to food with integrity also extends to the dairy products we serve the sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh recombinant bovine growth hormone also milk used to make much of our cheese and sour cream is sourced from pasturebased dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows 

in the spring of 2015 we announced we have reached our goal of eliminating as further described on our website genetically modified organisms or gmos from the ingredients in our food not including beverages in us chipotle restaurants as well as shophouse southeast asian kitchen while the meat and poultry we serve is not genetically modified the animals are likely fed a diet containing gmos due to the prevalence of gmos in a number of important feed crops the vast majority of the grains used as animal feed in the us are genetically modified with respect to beverages some of the beverages we serve are sweetened with cornbased sweeteners which are typically made with genetically modified corn 

 

we do occasionally face challenges associated with pursuing our food with integrity mission in addition to the supply challenges noted above there can be higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality environmental sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed nontherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are responsible farming practices many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area however we believe that in addition to seeking great tasting and nutritious food consumers are increasingly concerned about where their food comes from and how it is raised and we believe that as consumers become more educated about better animal welfare and farming practices as well as social accountability they will foster greater demand for responsibly grown foods in the long term we believe that increased demand over the long term for the types of meat and produce items we strive to serve will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers we also understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if we are able to continue growing while focusing on food with integrity we believe our sourcing flexibility will improve over time though we expect that most of these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than conventionally raised commoditypriced equivalents 

a few things thousands of ways chipotle restaurants serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats or tofu two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide thousands of choices we plan to keep a simple menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense 

in preparing our food we use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated and grilled in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef and vegetarian pinto and black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime juice and salt in addition to sodas fruit drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch with some prepared in our restaurants and some prepared with the same fresh ingredients in larger batches in commissaries 

food served fast … so that customers can enjoy it slowly our food is made slowly and carefully but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that prepared the food and are assembling the order while we think our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think they like getting food served fast without having a typical “fastfood” experience and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we do this by focusing on what we call the “f our p illars ” of t hr oughput having a dedicated expeditor who works just before the cashier to get drink and side orders and bag togo orders a dedicated linebacker to make sure the serving line is stocked with all our ingredients so the employees on the line can focus on each customer’s order proper mise en p lace  or putting everything in its place before starting food preparation  and ensuring that we have “ aces in their places ” or welltrained employees at each position during all of our peak periods when we do this well our customers are served quickly without feeling rushed we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations 

the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we constantly strive to improve the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic however we’ve also introduced a number of additional ways to serve our customers for instance our restaurants accept orders online or through an iphone or android ordering application to provide a more convenient experience by allowing customers to avoid standing in line we’ve also introduced catering in all us chipotle restaurants except in new york city and we offer delivery service through a number of third party services with whom we’ve partnered by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by expanding ways for customers to enjoy chipotle we believe that we can provide a high quality experience to more and more customers 

restaurant management and operations 

culture of top performers in addition to our focus on the food we serve we have a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying hiring and empowering topperforming employees we are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our employees and our customers the foundation of that culture starts 

 

with hiring the best people in our restaurants we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards yet allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we believe we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower a team of top performers we provide hands on shouldertoshoulder training along with career path training materials to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees we are committed to developing our people and promoting from within with about 84 of salaried management and about 97 of hourly management coming from internal promotions our best general managers who run great restaurants and develop strong empowered restaurant teams may be promoted to restaurateur and in that role can earn bonuses for developing people we have leveraged our outstanding restaurateurs’ leadership by giving many restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring one or more nearby restaurants this provides an opportunity for restaurateurs to develop into field leadership roles one restaurant at a time restaurateurs who have shown they can successfully run four restaurants by developing teams of empowered top performers including at least one restaurateur thereby creating a culture of high standards constant improvement and empowerment in each of their restaurants can be promoted to apprentice team leaders 

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques and microwaves used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats make fresh salsa and guacamole and cook rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a traditional fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants 

the front line is key  our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service and our open kitchen design allows customers to see that we prepare our food fresh throughout each and every day all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to interact with customers no matter their job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest periods we focus on attracting and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among general managers crew members and customers alike   

restaurant team each restaurant typically has a general manager or restaurateur a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an apprentice manager in most of our restaurants and we aim to have two or three hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 23 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our general managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes apprentice team leaders team leaders or area managers team directors executive team directors and restaurant support officers 

supply chain 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality and safety we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our 24 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and their understanding of our mission and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with suppliers we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols and our distribution centers purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages and we follow industry news trade issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas are purchased from a small number of suppliers for a discussion of risks related to our supply chain see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry –   failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations ” and “ risks related to our unique business strategy –   our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks” in item 1a “risk factors”   

marketing 

a great dining experience in our restaurants is our most powerful marketing of all but there is still a need to introduce our brand to new customers and engage with existing ones in other ways by helping them understand what makes chipotle different than 

 

other restaurants our advertising and promotional programs instore communications and other design elements all help to communicate something about what differentiates chipotle from typical fast food whether it’s engaging with chipotle via our various social media channels participating in our local events or simply eating a burrito at one of our restaurants each customer interaction affords us an important opportunity to build our brand as chipotle works to reinvigorate our brand in the wake of the food safetyrelated incidents that affected us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 our marketing will have a greater emphasis than usual on programs that are specifically designed to drive traffic into our restaurants an element of our marketing and communications programs will also focus on supply chain transparency as we work to help customers understand the changes we are making in an effort to establish ourselves as an industry leader in food safety 

our advertising has generally included print outdoor transit and radio ads but we also incorporate digital advertising into the mix and conduct strategic promotions that demonstrate our food with integrity mission while connecting us to likeminded individuals or organizations beyond these traditional channels we continue to pioneer new avenues of branded content aimed at making consumers more curious about some of the issues that are important to us and explaining why and how we are working to drive positive change in the nation’s food supply 

we also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as our unique food and people cultures have evolved in recent years to this end we have been developing more “owned media” including new video music and content programs a more visible event strategy that includes our “cultivate” food music and ideas festivals and participation in relevant events in markets around the country many of these programs allow us to tell our story with more nuance than is afforded by traditional advertising and help forge stronger emotional connections with our customers we have also increased our use of digital mobile and social media in our overall marketing mix giving customers greater opportunity to access chipotle in ways that are convenient for them and broadening our ability to engage with our customers individually 

alongside our excellent restaurant teams these efforts have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity as our customers learn more about us and share with others this approach allows us to build awareness and loyalty with relatively low advertising expenditures even in a competitive category and to differentiate chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right thing in every facet of our business 

competition 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location brand reputation and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locallyowned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout catering and delivery services among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally unlike chipotle a number of our competitors grow through franchising 

some of our competitors have formats that might resemble ours and many competitors are moving towards higher quality food to compete with us a number of these competitors have sought to differentiate themselves with a focus that overlaps with many facets of our food with integrity mission additionally several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as lower in fat carbohydrates or calories or otherwise better for customers or targeted at particular dietary preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segment of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who seek higherquality food as well as from convenience stores cafeterias and other dining outlets these competitors may have among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we do for more information see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry—competition could adversely affect us ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe we are wellpositioned versus many of our competitors given current consumer trends including increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared we also believe that we’re known for our focus on having teams of topperforming employees using classic cooking techniques to prepare food made from highquality ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen—resulting in delicious food—as well as our commitment to “food with integrity” we think this unique combination adds up to an excellent customer experience in our restaurants which we believe represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate however we will need to reestablish customer trust in light of the food safety incidents that negatively impacted us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 and doing so in the competitive environment in which we operate will be one of our key challenges in 2016 and beyond 

 

restaurant site selection 

we believe site selection is critical to our success and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential location our site selection process is led by our internal team of real estate managers and also includes the use of external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets locations proposed by real estate managers are reviewed by development management as part of a formal site ride as well as in a written real estate package we study the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and available information on competitors and other restaurants based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as inline or endcap locations in strip or power centers in regional malls and downtown business districts freestanding buildings food courts outlet centers airports military bases and train stations 

shophouse southeast asian kitchen and pizzeria locale 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle 

in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened our first shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 and we now have a total of 13 shophouse restaurants shophouse serves a menu that like at chipotle is focused main dishes consist of rice or noodle bowls made with steak chicken meatballs made with pork and chicken or tofu further during 2013 we invested in a consolidated entity that now owns and operates three pizzeria locale restaurants  a fast casual pizza concept serving   a menu that includes classic pizzas and salads from a select ion of highquality ingredients 

we expect our openings in 2016 to include a small number of shophouse and pizzeria locale restaurants with our immediate restaurant expansion focus remaining on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand   

information systems 

we use a variety of applications and systems to securely manage the flow of information within each restaurant and within our centralized corporate infrastructure the services available within our systems and applications include restaurant operations supply chain inventory scheduling training human capital management financial tools and data protection services the restaurant structure is based primarily on a pointofsales system that operates locally at the restaurant and is integrated with other functions necessary to restaurant operations it records sales transactions receives out of store orders and authorizes batches and transmits credit card transactions the system also allows employees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of   management reports select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant is collected in the central corporate infrastructure which enables management to continually monitor operating results 

we will continue to invest in our applications and systems to support our continued expansion see “ general business risks — we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information ” in item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of risks associated with our information systems 

employees 

as of december 31 2015 we had about 59330 employees including about 5100 salaried employees and about 54230 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results such as the adverse publicity that we saw during 2015 around foodborne illness incidents associated with our restaurants as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases

 item   1a  risk factors 

risks related to food safety incidents that occurred during 2015 

our systemwide restaurant sales were adversely impacted beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 by food safety incidents associated with our restaurants and we may not be able to regain lost sales 

during late october and early november 2015 illnesses caused by e coli bacteria were connected to a number of our restaurants initially in washington and oregon and subsequently to small numbers of our restaurants in as many as 12 other states as a result of these reported illnesses and related restaurant closures for remediation our companywide sales were adversely impacted with significant declines in our comparable restaurant sales in the days immediately following announcements related to the incidents during the week of december 7 2015 an unrelated incident involving norovirus was reported at a chipotle restaurant in brighton massachusetts which worsened the adverse financial and operating impacts we experienced from the earlier e coli incident as a result comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations declined 146 for the fourth quarter of 2015 including a 30 decline in december 2015 subsequent announcements and publicity regarding food safety incidents in our restaurants and the related criminal investigation described in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” had an additional negative impact on our sales trends with comparable restaurant sales declining over 36 in january 2016 

we believe the impact of these incidents on our sales has been exacerbated in part by the high expectations many customers have for us as a result of our food with integrity mission and our failure to meet those expectations may make recovery more difficult for us additionally the significant amount of media coverage regarding these incidents and the impact of social media which was not in existence during many past food safety incidents involving other restaurant chains in increasing the awareness of these incidents may also negatively impact our ability to recover from these incidents as a result of the foregoing factors it may take longer for our sales and customer perception of our brand to recover than has been the case during past food safety incidents associated with other restaurant chains and our sales may not recover at all even if we are able to regain lost customers we may not recover to the same average restaurant sales we were achieving prior to the fourth quarter of 2015 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months 

in an effort to invite customers back into our restaurants we are planning a number of marketing and promotional activities beginning in the first quarter of 2016 including distributing a large number of promotional offers for free or discounted food the costs associated with these and other marketing activities will negatively impact our profitability additionally these activities may not entice customers to visit our restaurants and even if they do they may not result in customers returning for subsequent visits and therefore may not be successful in helping us restore lost sales 

declines in comparable restaurant sales have a significant adverse impact on our profitability as described further under “ risks related to our growth strategy and future expansion – our sales and profitability will be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales continue to decline or otherwise fail to meet expectations in the future ” 

changes we have made in our operations or that we make in the future to further enhance the safety of the food we serve will adversely impact our financial performance and may negatively impact customer perception of our brand 

as a result of the food safety incidents associated with our restaurants during 2015 we have implemented a number of enhancements to our food safety protocols and intend to make additional enhancements to ensure that our food is as safe as it can be many of our new procedures which go beyond the industrystandard food safety practices that we were previously following will increase the cost of some ingredients or the amount of labor required to prepare and serve our food if we aren’t able to increase sales to offset the increased costs resulting from these changes our margins will fall well short of levels we have historically achieved even if we were to restore sales to levels we were achieving prior to the food safety incidents the increased costs from these changes will result in lower margins than we were able to achieve in the past 

additionally some of the enhanced food safety procedures we have introduced or may introduce in the future rely on increased use of centralized food preparation additional inrestaurant preparation steps or new ingredients some or all of which may be inconsistent with previous customer perceptions of our restaurant operations to the extent customers perceive any of these developments as a move away from our food with integrity strategy andor towards a more traditional fast food experience our ability to win back customers may be adversely impacted and our sales may decline or recover more slowly than they otherwise would have 

 

regulatory actions and litigation related to food safety incidents that impacted us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 may adversely impact us 

we are facing ongoing government investigations into the food safety incidents that occurred in 2015 including the criminal investigation described in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we also have received numerous claims from customers who were or claim to have been impacted by these incidents and a number of those claimants have filed lawsuits against us we are cooperating in the government investigations and with many of the customers impacted by these incidents but will incur significant legal and other costs in doing so we have also been sued in a shareholder class action lawsuit in connection with the decline in our stock price in the wake of the food safety incidents and defending this lawsuit will subject us to significant legal expense additionally the liabilities from customer claims and related litigation expenses may be greater than we anticipate due to the uncertainties inherent in litigation all of these costs liabilities and expenses will negatively impact our operating results moreover publicity regarding any legal proceedings related to food safety incidents may increase or prolong consumer awareness of the incidents or otherwise negatively impact perceptions of our brand which may hamper our ability to regain lost sales or attract new customers to our restaurants 

any further instances of foodborne or localized illnesses associated with our restaurants would result in increased negative publicity and further adverse impact on customer perceptions of our brand which would likely result in further declines in our sales 

because of customer perceptions about our restaurants and brand in the wake of the food safety incidents described above any future occurrence of foodborne illness associated with our restaurants would likely have an even more significant negative impact on our sales and our ability to regain customers although we have followed industry standard food safety protocols in the past and are further enhancing our food safety procedures to ensure that our food is as safe as it can be we may still be at a higher risk for foodborne illness occurrences than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh unprocessed produce and meats our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation and our avoiding frozen ingredients and in any event no food safety protocols can completely eliminate the risk of foodborne illness in any restaurant so our enhanced food safety protocols may not be successful in preventing a foodborne illness incident in the future the risk of illnesses associated with our food might also increase in connection with an expansion of our catering business or other situations in which our food is served in conditions we cannot control even if foodborne illnesses arise from conditions outside of our control the negative impact from any such illnesses is likely to be significant 

risks related to our growth strategy and future expansion 

our sales and profitability will be further adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales continue to decline or otherwise fail to meet expectations in the future 

while future sales growth will depend to an extent on our opening new restaurants changes in comparable restaurant sales also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting our profitability this is because the profit margin on incremental comparable restaurant sales is generally higher as a result of comparable restaurant sales increases increasing the sales base over which fixed costs are spread conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales as we have seen since november 2015 as a result of the food safety incidents discussed elsewhere in this report have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases 

our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

 

 



a number of these factors are beyond our control as a result it is possible that changes in our comparable restaurant sales will continue to be negative or that we otherwise will not achieve our targeted or expected comparable restaurant sales 

past declines in the rate of our comparable restaurant sales growth have significantly impacted our stock price for example beginning in the second quarter of 2015 prior to which we had reported five consecutive quarters of doubledigit comparable restaurant sales increases our comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated and following our reporting comparable restaurant sales increases of 26 for the third quarter of 2015 the price of our stock declined significantly this included a decline of nearly 8 over the three trading days immediately following the report even the expectation of declining comparable restaurant sales increases has had a significant impact on our stock price in the past for example when we announced in october 2014 that we expected comparable restaurant sales for 2015 in the low to midsingle digit range as opposed to the doubledigit comparable restaurant sales increases we reported for the third quarter of 2014 the price of our common stock declined nearly 7 on the following trading day any future deceleration in or failure to meet market expectations for our comparable restaurant sales increases would likely result in another significant decline in the price of our common stock 

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants in sites and on terms attractive to us which is subject to many unpredictable factors 

we had 2010 restaurants in operation as of december 31 2015 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly and plan to open between 220 and 235 new restaurants in 2016 however we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any one or more of the following factors 



one of our biggest challenges in opening new restaurants is staffing we seek to hire only topperforming employees and to promote general managers from our crew which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” 

another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for suitable new restaurant sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors could negatively impact our ability to manage our occupancy costs which may adversely impact our profitability in addition any of these factors may be exacerbated by economic factors which may result in developers and contractors seeing increased demand and therefore driving our construction and leasing costs up 

 

any decision to delay or forego a significant number of new restaurant openings or our inability to open the number of new restaurants we plan due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our existing restaurant base will decline which will make it increasingly difficult to achieve levels of sales and profitability growth that we have seen in the past   

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods similarly our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area and a larger proportion of our recent openings being in higher rent sites tha n we have historically targeted  it may also be difficult for us to attract a customer base if we are not able to staff our restaurants with employees who perform to our high standards if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable new restaurant sales volumes have been negatively impacted by the recent food safety issues described elsewhere in this report the negative impact has been of similar magnitude to the impact we have seen on comparable restaurant sales and as a result new restaurant sales may have a larger adverse impact on our results than they have in the past 

moreover our new restaurant development activity has broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and restaurants in airports food courts or on military sites the risks relating to building a customer base and managing development and operating costs may be more significant in some or all of these types of trade areas or restaurant sites which could have an unexpected negative impact on our new restaurant operating results in addition in the event we are not able to contain increases in our average restaurant development costs which could result from inflation an increase in the proportion of higher cost locations project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability 

we have also opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market 

our expansion into international markets may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors 

in 2008 we opened our first restaurant outside the us in toronto canada in 2010 we opened our first restaurant in the united kingdom in london in 2012 we opened our first restaurant in france in paris and in 2013 we opened our first restaurant in germany in frankfurt as of december 31 2015 23 of our restaurants were located outside of the us as a result of our small number of restaurants outside the us and the relatively short time we have been operating those restaurants we have lower brand awareness and less operating experience in these markets and our average restaurant sales andor transaction counts may be lower in these markets than in the us the markets in which we’ve opened restaurants outside the us and any additional new markets we enter outside the us in the future have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our us markets as a result new restaurants outside the us may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets specifically due to lower consumer familiarity with the chipotle brand differences in customer tastes or spending patterns or for other reasons sales at restaurants opened outside the us may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall growth and profitability we have also seen some deterioration in sales trends at our international locations since late 2015 which we believe may be attributable to expanding awareness of the foodborne illness incidents described elsewhere in this report and those trends may worsen as awareness of the incidents further expands to build brand awareness in international markets we may need to make greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations in those markets   

we may also find it more difficult in international markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture and labor costs may be higher in international markets due to increased regulation or local market conditions in addition restaurants outside the us have had higher construction occupancy and food costs than restaurants in 

 

existing markets and we may have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards markets outside the us may also have regulatory differences with the us with which we are not familiar or that subject us to significant additional expense or to which we are not able to successfully adapt which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could adversely impact our overall results our overall results may also be negatively affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar 

shophouse southeast asian kitchen pizzeria locale and other new restaurant concepts may not contribute to our growth 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which chipotle restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 and now have a total of 13 shophouse restaurants in and around washington dc los angeles and chicago we also have a majority ownership interest in a company operating three fast casual pizzeria locale restaurants in denver colorado and kansas city missouri and we plan to assist with the further expansion of pizzeria locale in the future shophouse and pizzeria locale are new brands and they have lower brand awareness lower sales and less operating experience than most chipotle restaurants and may not achieve the same restaurant economics as chipotle restaurants we have also explored investments in additional restaurant concepts which also would be newer brands that may not achieve the same success as chipotle notwithstanding our opening of shophouse investment in pizzeria locale and exploration of other restaurant brand opportunities our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand as a result we do not expect shophouse pizzeria locale or other concepts to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years we may also determine not to move forward with any further expansion of shophouse or pizzeria locale or to invest in other restaurant concepts these decisions would each limit our overall growth over the long term as well additionally expansion of shophouse or pizzeria locale or investments in other restaurant concepts might distract our management which could have an adverse impact on our core chipotle business 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

as described elsewhere in this report our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls information systems and personnel may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain general managers crew and corporate staff we also are continuing to attempt to improve our field management in an effort to develop additional topperforming general managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results 

risks related to operating in the restaurant industry 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our general managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits costs including the requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act or the affordable care act discussed further under “ regulatory and legal risks — the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results ” as well as competition and labor market pressures increased minimum wage requirements paid sick leave or vacation accrual mandates and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees especially general managers and crew members as we grow we believe we will need to promote or hire additional topperforming field leaders to ensure we hire and motivate good managers and crew and it may be difficult to identify and keep those field leaders our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or erode our employee and restaurant cultures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or 

 

crew could be costly and could negatively impact our operations moreover if our managers do not schedule our restaurant crews efficiently our restaurants may be overstaffed at some times which adversely impacts our labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreasing our operating margins efficient staffing may be more challenging in 2016 due to the uncertainty in sales trends created by the foodborne illness incidents described elsewhere in this report 

various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs as well changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees although we require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers we currently participate in the “everify” program an internetbased free program run by the us government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company however use of everify does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees for example following an audit by the department of homeland security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota during 2010 we lost approximately 450 employees resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations including slower throughput as we trained new employees as well as some degree of negative publicity the resulting broadbased civil and criminal investigations by the us attorney for the district of columbia and us securities and exchange commission of our compliance with work authorization requirements and related disclosures and statements may be ongoing see note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” termination of a significant number of employees in specific markets or across our company due to work authorization or other regulatory issues would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees we could also become subject to fines penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors 

because we do not franchise risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring payment and termination of employees and employeerelated litigation may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions global demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and cooking oils has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice increasing our food costs food prices for a number of our key ingredients escalated markedly at various points during 2014 and 2015 and there could be additional pricing pressure on key ingredients during 2016 costs will increase from the enhanced food safety procedures described elsewhere in this report and as a result we expect that food costs as a percentage of revenue in 2016 will increase compared to the full year 2015 

we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and animal welfare criteria or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for food products that are conventionally raised and grown weather related issues such as freezes or drought may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as produce or meats for instance drought conditions in parts of the us resulted in significant increases in beef prices during 2014 and 2015 increasing weather volatility or other longterm changes in global weather patterns including any changes associated with global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales and could also have an adverse impact on our brand 

 

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location brand reputation and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally some of these competitors and other fast casual concepts have sought to duplicate various elements of our business operations and more chains may copy us to varying degrees in the future additionally our newer concepts shophouse southeast asian kitchen and pizzeria locale operate in markets in which there are numerous competitors including a number of large and wellknown brands a number of other companies or individuals in the restaurant industry have recently opened or invested in fastcasual pizza concepts in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and other dining outlets these competitors may have among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

instances of foodborne illnesses could adversely affect customer perceptions of or the price or availability of ingredients we use to prepare our food which may adversely impact our sales 

past reports linking nationwide or regional incidents of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella e coli hepatitis a lysteria or norovirus to certain produce items have caused us to temporarily suspend serving some ingredients in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu and have resulted in consumers avoiding certain products for a period of time similarly outbreaks of avian flu incidents of “mad cow” disease or similar concerns have also caused consumers to avoid any products that are or are suspected of being affected these problems and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse effect on the price and availability of affected ingredients a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants would further adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability in addition if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient or operating costs resulting from supply problems or operational changes associated with incidents of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination which we may detect more frequently under the highresolution testing protocols we’ve recently introduced inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or deciding not to follow our required protocols or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations in particular shortages of one or more of our menu items could force our restaurants to remove items from their menus which may result in customers choosing to eat elsewhere if that happens our affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the menu item shortage and potentially thereafter if customers do not return to us after the shortage is resolved our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe than at other restaurants 

 

we have almost no longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on a third party distribution network with a limited number of distribution partners if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason the risk of ingredient shortages may increase and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken tofu beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our food with integrity suppliers and as described in more detail below under “ risks related to our unique business strategy — our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks  ” these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

in the first quarter of 2015 through our ongoing auditing of suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards and suspended purchases of pork from this supplier without this supply we did not have enough pork meeting our specifications for all of our restaurants and a large number of our restaurants were not serving carnitas for a number of months during 2015 we believe our comparable restaurant sales were adversely impacted as a result as customers chose to eat elsewhere rather than substituting a different one of our menu items for carnitas 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods and our focus on a limited menu could make the consequences of a change in consumer preferences more severe than our competitors may face some customers could also avoid freshlyprepared foods like those we serve based on concerns regarding food safety this may be more likely to impact us as a result of the widelypublicized food safety incidents we experienced in 2015 

our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels our average restaurant sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty which can be caused by various factors such as high unemployment increasing taxes interest rates or other changes in fiscal or monetary policy high gasoline prices declining home prices tight credit markets or foreign political or economic unrest any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

if we were to experience widespread difficulty renewing existing leases on favorable terms our revenue or occupancy costs could be adversely affected 

we lease substantially all of the properties on which we operate restaurants and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value which could involve substantial increases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals could adversely impact us if we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs reducing our restaurant margins 

regulatory and legal risks 

governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs 

employment and immigration regulations 

we are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements 

 

insurance and workers’ compensation rules and antidiscrimination laws complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for noncompliance for example a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee classification employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we could suffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant in addition several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs in addition see “— the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results ” below for a discussion of risks related to recent changes in us healthcare laws 

we also are audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well and recent audit activity and federal criminal and civil investigations in this area are described in more detail above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” as well as in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees on the other hand in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants we could be found to be in violation of antidiscrimination laws we could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance antidiscrimination compliance or both that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees moreover in addition to the criminal and civil investigations mentioned above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia and the us securities and exchange commission have informed us that they are conducting parallel investigations into possible criminal and civil securities law violations relating to our employee work authorization compliance and related disclosures and statements as well the foregoing investigations may continue to be expensive and distracting and could subject us to fines reputational damage and other liabilities that could be significant 

additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to topperforming employees could be impaired potential changes in labor laws including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture 

americans with disabilities act and similar state laws 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act or ada and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we have incurred substantial legal fees in connection with adarelated complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws the expenses associated with these modifications or any damages legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ada or similar state laws could be material 

nutrition and food regulation 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and a number of other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available and nationwide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the us health care reform law are scheduled to go into effect as of december 1 2016 these nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales 

 

privacycybersecurity 

we are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is evolving and increasingly demanding at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf if the security and information systems of ours or of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees additional risks related to cybersecurity are described below under “ general business riskswe may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information ” 

local licensure zoning and other regulation 

each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

environmental laws 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

other aspects of regulatory risk 

from time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various laws and regulations that cover our business much of this litigation occurs in california even though currently only about 17 of our restaurants are located there as we continue to expand in california or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in california our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in or minimized our operations in california 

because we do not franchise the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business as described above may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results 

we offer eligible fulltime and parttime us employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us for various reasons many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans however under the comprehensive us health care reform law enacted in 2010 the affordable care act changes that became effective in 2014 and especially the employer mandate and employer penalties that became effective january 1 2015 may increase our labor costs significantly in future years in 2015 we adopted a qualifying plan under the affordable care act for our fulltime hourly employees changes under the affordable care act including the imposition of a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage 

 

may result in employees who are currently eligible but have not elected to participate in our healthcare plans increasingly finding it advantageous to do so which may increase our healthcare costs in the future which may further increase our healthcare expenses it is also possible that even in light of recent changes in the healthcare plans we offer healthcare plans offered by other companies with which we compete for employees will make us less attractive to our current or potential employees and in any event implementing the requirements of the affordable care act has imposed some additional administrative costs on us and those costs may increase over time the costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

we’re subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters including wages work hours overtime vacation and family leave discrimination wrongful termination and similar matters and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future our customers also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we’re responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices see “— governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs ” above for additional discussion of these types of claims from time to time we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertising practices we have been subject to a number of these actions and may be subject to additional actions of this type in the future we are also undergoing government investigations and have been sued in a shareholder class action lawsuit each as described elsewhere in this report including in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and these matters may be particularly expensive to defend andor resolve 

we believe the number of many of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers particularly in california regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we’re ultimately held liable for such claims they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations whether directed at us or at fast casual or quickservice restaurants generally may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects which in turn could adversely affect our results 

risks related to our unique business strategy 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice restaurant segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create additionally it will likely be more difficult for us to persuade the public about the value of our food following the foodborne illnesses we experienced in 2015 and the associated deterioration of customer perceptions about our brand and we cannot predict when those perceptions will improve if ever if customers are not persuaded that we offer a good value for their money our restaurant transaction counts could be adversely affected which would negatively impact our business results 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

the principle of food with integrity constitutes a significant part of our business strategy we use a substantial amount of ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on practices we believe to be more sustainable or responsible than some conventional practices and try to make food as fresh as we can we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are more responsible farming practices as well as uncertainty regarding demand due to changing customer perceptions economic trends and 

 

other factors many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area although all of our restaurants generally serve meat from animals raised in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we may experience shortages of meat meeting these criteria due to suppliers suspending production market conditions or other forces beyond our control in the first quarter of 2015 through our ongoing auditing of suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards and suspended purchases of pork from this supplier without this supply we did not have enough pork meeting our specifications for all of our restaurants and a large number of our restaurants were not serving carnitas for a number of months during 2015 we believe our comparable restaurant sales were adversely impacted as a result we have experienced shortages of beef or chicken meeting our protocols on a periodic basis over the past several years as well resulting in our serving commodity beef and chicken which may have a negative impact on customer perceptions of our brand 

if as a result of any of the factors described above we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of our preferred ingredients on a costeffective basis our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with food with integrity which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline our commitment to food with integrity may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our food with integrity approach any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants we may also face adverse publicity or liability for false advertising claims if suppliers do not adhere to all of the elements of our food with integrity programs such as responsible meat protocols requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods our use of nongmo ingredients in our food and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions if any such supplier failures occur and are publicized our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted and our food with integrity message may result in customers holding us to a higher standard in terms of food safety as well which may make it more difficult for us to recover from the foodborne illness incidents discussed elsewhere in this report 

additionally in response to increasing customer awareness and demand some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones dairy products from cows not treated with rbgh and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our food with integrity philosophy if competitors become known for using these types of higherquality or more sustainable ingredients it could further limit our supply of these ingredients and may make it more difficult for us to differentiate chipotle and our restaurants which could adversely impact our operating results 

our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

our chairman and cochief executive officer steve ells founded our company has been the principal architect of our business strategy and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 2000 restaurants today monty moran our cochief executive officer and jack hartung our chief financial officer have also served with us since early in our company’s history and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well we believe our executive officers each of whom is an atwill employee without any employment contract have created an employee culture food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team we also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision if our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted 

our marketing and advertising strategies may not be successful which could adversely impact our business 

we have developed a marketing and advertising strategy that we believe is unique in the restaurant industry we have not generally advertised on television and engage in very limited price or valuebased promotions instead we invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will increase customers’ connection with our brand if these marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant sales the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect we may be particularly dependent on the success of our marketing programs in 2016 when we plan to invest significantly in marketing and promotional spending including significant use of free and discounted food promotions in an effort to attract customers back to our restaurants and reverse negative sales trends these efforts may not be successful 

in addition our marketing has increasingly incorporated elements intended to encourage customers to question sources or production methods commonly used to produce food these elements of our marketing could alienate food suppliers and other food industry groups and may potentially lead to an increased risk of disputes or litigation if suppliers or other constituencies believe our marketing is unfair or misleading increased costs in connection with any such issues or any deterioration in our relationships with existing suppliers could adversely impact us or our reputation furthermore if these messages do not resonate with our customers or potential customers the value of our brands may be eroded 

 

we have also implemented strategies such as remote ordering and catering options in an effort to increase overall sales our catering program in particular is new and untested and may not increase our sales to the degree we expect or at all catering and other outofrestaurant sales options also introduce new operating procedures to our restaurants and we may not successfully execute these procedures which could adversely impact the customer experience in our restaurants and thereby harm our sales and customer perception of our brand 

general business risks 

we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2015 approximately 684 of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen including a number of highly publicized incidents with wellknown retailers in recent years in august 2004 the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data as a result we recorded losses and related expenses totaling 43 million from 2004 through 2006 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

we also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf we have seen an increase over the past several years in the frequency and sophistication of attempts to compromise the security of several of these systems if the security and information systems that we or our outsourced third party providers use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees 

negative publicity relating to our restaurants or our company could adversely impact our reputation which may significantly harm us 

we depend significantly on customers’ perception of and connection to our brand in addition to the damage to our reputation from wellpublicized food safety incidents during 2015 as described elsewhere in this report we may experience negative publicity from time to time relating to food quality customer complaints restaurant facilities advertising and other business practices litigation alleging injuries government investigations or other regulatory issues our suppliers’ potential failure to adhere to elements of our food with integrity protocols other issues regarding the integrity of our suppliers’ food processing employee relationships customer or employee data breaches or other matters regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held to be responsible the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one or more restaurants or any of the foregoing topics may extend far beyond the restaurants involved and affect many more or even all of our restaurants the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated a similar risk exists with respect to unrelated food service businesses if consumers associate those businesses with our own operations and even publicity that could reasonably be viewed as positive may have adverse consequences on our business for example positive developments in regards to the food safety issues that have impacted us might have the effect of continuing or increasing customer awareness of the issue 

the adverse impact of publicity on customers’ perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales if the impact of any such publicity is particularly longlasting the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished additionally negative publicity about our employment practices may affect our reputation among employees and potential employees which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain topperforming employees that could adversely impact the quality of the customer experience we can offer and our operations generally and may increase our labor costs as well 

 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability property damage and auto liability we are selfinsured for our employee health plans but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability property damage and auto liability insurance   

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos our food with integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors because of various factors including 

  

 

 



  

seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading days—that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall this risk may be a greater concern during 2016 as the significant negative impacts we have seen to our business in the wake of food safety incidents during the fourth quarter have made it considerably more difficult for analysts and investors to forecast our results for at least the next few quarters 

additionally we believe the market price of our common stock which has generally traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most or all of our peer companies has typically reflected high market expectations for our future operating results the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times as well as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion together with item 6 “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the discussion contains forwardlooking statements involving risks uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations factors that might cause such differences include those described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

overview 

chipotle operates fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality  safest ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees enables us to develop future leaders from within we believe that these fundamental principles can be adapted to other cuisines as well 

2015 highlights and trends 

foodborne illness incidents beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 significant publicity regarding a number of foodborne illness incidents associated with chipotle restaurants in as many as 15 states had a severe adverse impact on our sales and profitability as a result of these incidents comparable restaurant sales declined 146 for the fourth quarter of 2015 including a decline of 30 for the month of december and the decline worsened to over 36 in january 2016 comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation we anticipate some improvement in sales trends as a result of the announcement on february 1 2016 by the us centers for disease control and prevention that it has closed its investigation into the e coli incidents that first led to the significant decline in our comparable restaurant sales however due to the uncertainties created by the foodborne illness incidents we are unable to provide estimates of any future movements in comparable restaurant sales we plan to increase marketing and promotional spending considerably during the first half of 2016 including significant use of free and discounted food promotions in an effort to attract customers back to our restaurants and reverse negative sales trends 

in additi on to the impact on sales the foodborne illness incidents resulted in nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarte r of 2015 of approximately 160 million  which includes food waste impairment charges for kitchen equipment that will no longer be used insurance claim estimates increased marketing expenses lab analysis of food samples and environmental swabs and retaining expert advisory services related to epidemiology and food safety 

as part of our response to the foodborne illness incidents we are implementing enhanced food safety procedures in our supply chain and restaurants that we expect to increase our food costs as a percentage of revenue some of these changes are expected to result in fewer labor hours being required in our restaurants but we do not expect to see the benefit until free and discounted food promotions return to normal levels we expect the ongoing net impact of the enhanced food safety procedures on our food and labor costs as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 2 when fully implemented and after our operations are normalized additionally we expect that our restaurant operating costs as a percentage of revenue will continue to be significantly impacted due to expected lower average restaurant sales as well as increased costs to support marketing initiatives as a result of the sales impact from the foodborne illness incidents and the additional costs described above we believe that our net income will be at approximately breakeven levels in the first quarter of 2016 

sales average restaurant sales were 2424 million as of december 31 2015 decreasing from 2472 million as of december 31 2014 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months  and as a result the foregoing average restaurant sales include approximately 10 months of operations prior to the adverse impact of the foodborne illness incidents described above accordingly average restaurant sales will decrease further for as long as we continue to post comparable restaurant sales declines   our comparable restaurant sales increases were 02 for the full year 2015 comparable restaurant sales increases in 2015 were driven primarily by the impact of menu price increases taken nationwide in the second quarter of 2014 and in selected restaurants in the second half of 2015 offset by lower average number of transactions and group size primarily in the fourth quarter menu price increases accounted for a 35 increase in our comparable restaurant sales increases for 2015 

 

restaurant development  as of december 31 2015 we had 2010 restaurants in operation including 1971 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states with an additional 11 in canada seven in england four in france and one in germany our restaurants include 13 shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants serving asianinspired cuisine and we are an investor in a consolidated entity that owns and operates three pizzeria locale restaurants a fast casual pizza concept new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth and we opened 229 restaurants in 2015 and expect to open between 220 and 235 restaurants in 2016 including a small number of chipotle restaurants outside of the us and shophouse and pizzeria locale restaurants within the us  

food with integrity in all of our restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones and in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we brand these meats as “responsibly raised tm ” in addition a portion of some of the produce items we serve d wa s organically grown andor sourced locally when in season by which we mean within 350 miles of the restaurant where it wa s served  a portion of the beans we serve is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which they are grown the sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh milk used to make much of our cheese and sour cream is sourced from pasturebased dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows further we have achieved our goal of eliminating as further described on our website genetically modified organisms or gmos from the ingredients in our food not including beverages in us chipotle restaurants as well as shophouse southeast asian kitchen while the meat and poultry we serve is not genetically modified the animals are likely fed a diet containing gmos we will continue to search for quality ingredients that not only taste delicious but also benefit local farmers or the environment or otherwise benefit or improve the sustainability of our supply chain 

one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to continue serving meats that are raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so in january 2015 through an ongoing audit of our suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards related to the size and condition of the housing offered to some of the pigs so we suspended our purchases from this supplier without this supply we were unable to get enough pork to meet our standards for all of our restaurants and were not able to serve carnitas in many of our us restaurants for a portion of the year during the third quarter of 2015  we began introducing carnitas from a new pork supplier in the united kingdom and this new pork supply allowed us to serve carnitas in all of our restaurants by the end of 2015 additionally some of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised beef or chicken or stop serving one or more menu items in the future due to supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

stock repurchases in accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors  we purchased shares of our common stock during 2015 with an aggregate total repurchase price of 4858 million as of december 31 2015 1164 million was available for stock repurchases under the authorization announced on december 4 2015 we also announced authorizations by our board of directors of up to an additional 300 million in common stock repurchases on january 6 2016 and up to another additional 300 million on february 2 2016 we have purchased 2700 million of our common stock under these authorizations from january 1 2016 through february 3 2016 we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b51c authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time subject to market conditions the existing repurchase agreement and the board’s authorization s of the repurchases may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

restaurant openings relocations and closures 

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 



results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section a s we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase 

 

revenue 



in 2015 increased revenue   was primarily driven by new restaurant openings revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed 3904 million of the increase in sales in 2015 of which 1836 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year 

in 2014 the significant factors contri buting to our increases in revenue were comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings comparable revenue increases contributed 5300 million of the increase in restaurant sales due primarily to increases in customer visits and an increase in average check amount  including the benefit from menu price increases restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed 3647 million of the increase in sales in 2014 of which 1739 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year 

food beverage and packaging costs   



food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2015 primarily due to the benefit of the nationwide me nu price increases taken in the second quarter of 2014 and relief in dairy and avocado costs the decrease was partial ly offset by inflation on beef costs 

food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2014 due to inflation on many food items primarily beef avocados and dairy the increase was partially offset by the impact of menu price increases 

labor costs   



labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2015 due primarily to wage inflation and an increased number of crew and managers in each of our restaurants caused by scheduling inefficiencies occurring earlier in the year based on expected lower average restaurant sales we expect labor costs as a percentage of revenue to increase for 2016 

labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2014 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales including the impact of menu price increases partially offset by an increased number of managers and crew in our restaurants and normal wage inflation 

 

occupancy costs   



occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2015 primarily due to higher average rents for new locations  occupancy costs are expected to increase as a percentage of revenue during 2016 as a result of expected lower average restaurant sales   

in 2014 occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

other operating costs   



other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs bank and credit card fees and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs other operating costs increased in 2015 due primarily to a change in the classification of kitchen gloves out of food beverage and packaging costs beginning in 2015 and higher marketing and promotional costs we expect other operating costs to increase significantly as a percentage of revenue for 2016 as we pursue a marketing campaign    including an increase in free food promotions   to regain customers after the recent food borne illness incidents and due to expected lower average restaurant sales as a result of those incidents  

other operating costs de creased as a percentage of revenue in 2014 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

general and administrative expenses   



the decrease in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms for 2015 primarily resulted from decreased noncash stockbased compensation expense lower bonus expense and decreased expense associated with our biennial all managers’ conference  or amc  held in the third quarter of 2014 stockbased compensation expense decreased 394 million   the decrease was primarily due to a change in the structure of our executive compensation  as well as a decrease in our estimate of nonvested performance stock awards that we expect to vest resulting in a cum ulative adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2015 reducing expense by 122 million  the total decrease was partially offset by higher payroll costs as we grew we expect general and administrative expenses in dollar terms for 2016 to increase due  in part to additional stockbased compensation expense  payroll costs as we grow and costs associated with our 2016 amc scheduled for the third quarter of 2016 

 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2014 primarily resulted from increased noncash stockbased compensation expense higher payroll and bonus costs as we grew as well as costs from our amc held in the third quarter of 2014 

depreciation and amortization   



depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue in 2015 due to reinvestment costs for our restaurants as they age 

in 2014 depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue as a result of the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

loss on disposal of assets 



loss on disposal of assets increased in 2015 due to impairment charges resulting from an internally developed software program that we chose not to implement and related hardware the discontinued use of certain kitchen equipment as we move more food preparation to central kitchens as well as restaurant relocations  loss on disposal of assets remained relatively consistent in 2014 

income tax provision 



in 2015 and 2014 the effective tax rate was lower than 2013 because there was a decrease in the state tax rate additionally 2014 included a benefit from filing the 2013 tax returns which included a nonrecurring change in the estimate of usable employer credits for 2016 we expect the effective tax rate to be 390 due to expected lower income before income taxes  

 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2015 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter results from the quarter ended december 31 2015 include the impact of the foodborne illness incidents described elsewhere in this report and these incidents are likely to impact our results in future quarters 



seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results   such as the adverse publicity that we saw during 2015 around foodborne illness incidents associated with our restaurants  as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases the number of trading days in a quart er can also affect our results although on an overall annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact   

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of noncash stockbased compensation expense the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs we have a cash and shortterm investment balance of 6632 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions  to maintain our existing restaurants and f or general corporate purposes as of december 31 2015 there was 1164 million remaining available under repurchase authorizations previously approved by our board of directors we announced authorizations by our board of directors of up to an additional 300 million in common stock repurchases on january 6 2016 and up to another additional 300 million on february 2 2016 we also have a long term investments balance of 6229 million which consists of us treasury notes with maturities of 13 months to approximately 2 years we believe that cash from operations together with our cash and investment balances will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

 

o ne of our primary uses of cash is in new restaurant development our total capital expen ditures for 2015 were 2574 million and we expect to incur cap ital expenditures of about 260 million in 2016 of w hich about 200 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments  information technology and infrastructure initiatives as well as food safety initiatives  in 2015 we spent on average about 805000 in development and construction costs per restaurant net of landlord reim bursements of approximately 77000 for new restaurants to be opened in 2016 we anticipate average development costs will remain generally consistent with 2015  

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 were as follows 



  

1 we enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed for orders related to produce and other ingredients and supplies construction contractor and subcontractor agreements orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships 

the majority of our restau rants and administrative office leases are noncancelable obligations  our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 1 0 to 15 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food healthcare costs labor fuel utility costs materials used in the construction of our restaurants and insurance although almost all of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level  additionally many of our leases require us to pay property taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases there have been   and there may be in the future delays in implementing such menu price increases and we do not expect to increase menu prices while our sales are depressed due to the food safety incidents discussed elsewhere in this report if we do raise menu prices in the future general competitive pressures may limit our ability   to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation  

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our signific ant accounting policies in note 1 and note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the 

 

lease term or 20 years we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straightline basis over the reasonably assured lease term the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights or sosars and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards and sosars with performancebased vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different awards that contain service performance and market conditions ultimately vest based on chipotle’s relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in the annual average s of revenue growth net income growth and total shareholder return our estimates of chipotle’s future performance and the future perfo rmance of the restaurant industry peer group are assumptions if we had arrived at difference assumptions for revenue growth net income or total shareholder return for chipotle or the peer group our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different   

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for workers’ compensation general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as 1 million and for property which generally has a 15 million deductible we are self insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2015 were 403 million 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2015  although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

commodity price risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices however a majority of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance 

changing interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2015 we had 1 0842 million in investments and interestbearing cash accounts including an insurance related restricted trust account classified in other assets and 1991 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 062 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is limited at this date

 item 1 business tableend general 

chipotle mexican grill inc and its subsidiaries “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operate chipotle mexican grill restaurants which serve a focused menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads made using fresh ingredients as of december 31 2014 we operated 1755 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states as well as seven in canada six in england three in france and one in germany additionally our restaurants include nine shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants serving asianinspired cuisine and we are an investor in a consolidated entity that owns and operates two pizzeria locale restaurants a fast casual pizza concept resulting in a total of 1783 restaurants as of december 31 2014 we focus on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on building a special people culture that is centered on creating a team of top performers empowered to achieve high standards on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment we have grown substantially over the past five years and expect to open between 190 and 205 additional restaurants in 2015 including a small number of shophouse and pizzeria locale restaurants 

our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people 

  

to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

we manage our operations and restaurants based on eight regions that aggregate into one reportable segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 and our total assets as of december 31 2014 and 2013 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the us for a discussion of risks related to our international operations see “ risks related to our growth strategy and future expansion—our expansion into international markets may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

our menu and food preparation 

food with integrity serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food as part of our food with integrity philosophy we believe that purchasing fresh ingredients and preparing them by hand are not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on the sources of each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food 

in all of our restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones and in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we brand these meats as “responsibly raised tm ” one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to serve meats raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so in january 2015 through an ongoing audit of our suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards related to the size and condition of the housing offered to some of the pigs so we suspended our purchases from this supplier without this supply we cannot get enough pork that meets our standards for all of our restaurants and we will not be able to serve carnitas in about onethird of our us restaurants until we can find additional sources which meet our standards to make up the shortfall in addition some of our restaurants served conventionally raised beef and chicken for periods during 2014 and we expect some to serve conventionally raised beef in 2015 due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised meats more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to additional supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

we also seek to use more responsibly grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown andor sourced locally while in season by which we mean grown within 350 miles of the restaurant where it is served a portion of our beans is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown our commitment to food with integrity extends to the dairy products we serve as well the sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh recombinant bovine growth hormone also milk used to make much of our cheese and all our sour cream is sourced from pasturebased dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows further we disclose on our website which ingredients contain genetically modified organisms or gmos and we are working to replace ingredients containing gmos in our food not including beverages with nongmo ingredients while the meat and poultry we serve is not genetically modified the animals are likely fed a diet containing gmos because of the prevalence of gmos in a number of important feed crops most grains used as animal feed in the us are genetically modified 

  

we do face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity in addition to the supply challenges noted above there can be higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality environmental sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed nontherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are responsible farming practices many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area however we believe that in addition to seeking great tasting and nutritious food consumers are increasingly concerned about where their food comes from and how it is raised and we believe that as consumers become more educated about better animal welfare and farming practices as well as social accountability they will foster greater demand for responsibly grown foods in the long term we believe that increased demand over the long term for the types of meat and produce items we strive to serve will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers we also understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if we are able to continue growing while focusing on food with integrity we believe our sourcing flexibility will improve over time though we expect that most of these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than conventionally raised commoditypriced equivalents 

a few things thousands of ways chipotle restaurants serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats or tofu two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices we plan to keep a simple menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense such as the recent introduction in all us and canadian markets of sofritas our vegan protein option made with braised organic tofu and if customers can’t find something on the menu that’s quite what they’re after we encourage them to let us know if we can make it from the ingredients we have we’ll do it 

in preparing our food we use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated and grilled in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef and vegetarian pinto and black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime juice and kosher salt in addition to sodas fruit drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in larger batches in commissaries 

food served fast … so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that prepared the food and are assembling the order while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a typical “fastfood” experience and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we do this by focusing on what we call the “four pillars” of throughput the four pillars are having a dedicated expeditor who works just before the cashier to get drink and side orders and bag togo orders a dedicated linebacker to make sure the serving line is stocked with all our ingredients so the employees on the line can focus on each customer’s order proper mise en place  and ensuring that we have “aces in their places” or the best employees at each position during all of our peak periods when we do this our customers are served quickly without feeling rushed we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we constantly strive to improve the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more 

  

customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic for instance our restaurants accept orders by fax online or through an iphone or android ordering application in order to provide a more convenient experience by allowing customers to avoid standing in line by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our restaurant operations we believe that we can provide a high quality experience to more and more customers 

quality assurance and food safety we are committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety are integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs for our supply chain our training and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations 

restaurant management and operations 

culture of top performers in addition to our focus on the food we serve we have a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying hiring and empowering top performing employees we are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our employees and our customers the foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best people in our restaurants we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards yet allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we believe we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower a team of top performers we provide hands on shouldertoshoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees we are committed to developing our people and promoting from within with about 90 of salaried management and about 98 of hourly management coming from internal promotions our best general managers who run great restaurants and develop strong empowered restaurant teams are promoted to restaurateur and in that role can earn bonuses for developing people we’ve leveraged our outstanding restaurateurs’ leadership by giving many restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring one or more nearby restaurants this provides an opportunity for restaurateurs to develop into field leadership roles one restaurant at a time restaurateurs who have shown they can successfully run four restaurants by developing teams of empowered top performers including at least one restaurateur thereby creating a culture of high standards constant improvement and empowerment in each of their restaurants can be promoted to apprentice team leaders 

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques and microwaves used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats handcut produce and herbs make fresh salsa and guacamole and cook rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a typical fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants 

the front line is key  our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service and our open kitchen design allows customers to see that we prepare our food fresh throughout each and every day all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to interact with customers no matter their job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among general managers crew members and customers alike 

  

restaurant team  each restaurant typically has a general manager or restaurateur a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an apprentice manager in most of our restaurants and we aim to have one to three hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 24 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our general managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes apprentice team leaders team leaders or area managers team directors executive team directors or regional directors and restaurant support officers 

supply chain 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our 22 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and their understanding of our mission and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with suppliers we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols and our distribution centers purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages and we follow industry news trade issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas are purchased from a small number of suppliers for a discussion of risks related to our supply chain see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry—failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations” and “ risks related to our unique business strategy—our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks” in item 1a “risk factors” 

distribution arrangements ingredients and other supplies are delivered to our restaurants by our independently owned and operated regional distribution centers 

marketing 

a great dining experience in our restaurants is our most powerful marketing of all but there is still a need to introduce our brand to consumers in other ways and to help them understand what makes chipotle different than other restaurants our advertising and promotional programs instore communications and other design elements all help to communicate something about what differentiates chipotle from other fast food companies whether it’s engaging with our company via social media participating in our local events or simply eating a burrito at one of our restaurants each customer interaction affords us an important opportunity to build our brand 

our advertising has generally included print outdoor transit and radio ads but we also incorporate online advertising into the mix and conduct strategic promotions that demonstrate our food with integrity mission while connecting us to likeminded individuals or organizations beyond these traditional channels we are continuing to explore and pioneer new avenues of branded content aimed at making consumers more curious about issues that are important to us and explaining why and how we are working to drive positive change in the nation’s food supply in addition we continue to generate considerable media coverage with scores of publications writing favorably about our food restaurant concept and business 

we also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as we have evolved our unique food and people cultures to this end we have been developing more “owned media” including new video and music programs a more visible event strategy that includes our “cultivate” food music and ideas festivals and participation in relevant events in markets around the country many of these newer programs allow us to tell our 

  

story with more nuance than is afforded by traditional advertising and help forge stronger emotional connections with our customers we have also increased our use of digital mobile and social media in our overall marketing mix giving customers greater opportunity to access chipotle in ways that are convenient for them and broadening our ability to engage with our customers individually 

collectively these efforts and our excellent restaurant teams have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity as our customers learn more about us and share with others this approach allows us to build awareness and loyalty with relatively low advertising expenditures even in a competitive category and to differentiate chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right thing in every facet of our business 

competition 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locallyowned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally unlike chipotle a number of our competitors grow through franchising 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as lower in fat carbohydrates or calories or otherwise better for customers or targeted at particular dietary preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segment of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who seek higherquality food as well as from convenience stores cafeterias and other dining outlets these competitors may have among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we do for more information see “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry—competition could adversely affect us ” in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends including increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared as well as the increasing prevalence of the fastcasual segment some of our competitors have formats that might resemble ours but we believe that chipotle has become one of the most recognized restaurants in the us we also believe we are known for our focus on having teams of topperforming employees using classic cooking techniques to prepare food made from highquality whole ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food as well as our commitment to “food with integrity” we think this unique combination adds up to an excellent customer experience in our restaurants which we believe represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate 

restaurant site selection 

we believe site selection is critical to our success and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential location our site selection process includes the use of external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets taking direction from our internal team of real estate managers locations proposed by real estate managers are reviewed by development management as part of a formal site ride as well as in a written real estate package we study the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and available information on competitors based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as inline or endcap locations in strip or power centers in regional malls and downtown business districts freestanding buildings food courts and airports our 

  

new restaurant development activity has broadened to incorporate trade areas or restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and on military bases 

shophouse southeast asian kitchen and pizzeria locale 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle 

in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened our first shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 and we now have a total of nine shophouse restaurants shophouse serves a menu that like at chipotle is focused main dishes consist of rice or noodle bowls made with steak chicken meatballs made with pork and chicken or tofu further during 2013 we invested in a consolidated entity that now owns and operates two pizzeria locale restaurants a fast casual pizza concept serving a menu that includes classic pizzas and salads from a selection of highquality ingredients 

notwithstanding our opening of shophouse and investment in pizzeria locale and our plans in 2015 for a small number of additional shophouse and pizzeria locale restaurants our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results such as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases 

our intellectual property and trademarks 

“chipotle” “chipotle mexican grill” “unburritable” “food with integrity” “fresh is not enough anymore” “the gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands” “responsibly raised” “shophouse” and a number of related designs and logos are us registered trademarks of chipotle we have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the us in addition to our us registrations we have registered trademarks for “chipotle” and a number of other marks in canada the european union and various other countries and have filed trademark applications for “chipotle mexican grill” “chipotle” and a number of other marks in various countries as well 

we also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress from time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks restaurant designs or advertising although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 

information systems 

we use an integrated architecture of applications and systems to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and within our centralized corporate infrastructure the restaurant structure includes a pointofsales system that operates locally at the restaurant and is integrated with other functions necessary to restaurant operations it records sales transactions receives out of store orders and authorizes batches and transmits credit card transactions the system also allows employees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of 

  

management reports select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant is collected in the central corporate infrastructure which enables management to continually monitor operating results the services available within this infrastructure include supply chain inventory scheduling training human capital management financial tools and data protection services we believe that our current systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion 

in addition to processing payment card transactions and collecting and storing information about our employees we also collect and store information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of employee or customer information on our behalf the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which information may have been stolen including a number of highly publicized incidents with wellknown retailers in recent years see “ general business risks — we may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information ” in item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of risks associated with our information systems 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we had about 53090 employees including about 4590 salaried employees and about 48500 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks related to our growth strategy and future expansion 

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales increases are less than we expect and we may not successfully increase comparable restaurant sales or they may decrease 

while future sales growth will depend to an extent on our opening new restaurants changes in comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases we expect 2015 full year 

  

comparable restaurant sales increases to be in the low to midsingle digit range as comparisons become more difficult particularly during the final three quarters of the year as we begin to overlap nationwide menu price increases implemented in 2014 

our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted or expected comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative a number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases 

past declines in our comparable restaurant sales increases have significantly impacted our stock price beginning in the second quarter of 2012 prior to which we had been experiencing strong comparable restaurant sales growth momentum our comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated and the price of our stock declined significantly in the wake of this deceleration including a decline of nearly 22 on the trading day following our second quarter 2012 earnings release moreover even the expectation of declining comparable restaurant sales increases has had a significant impact on our stock price in the past for example when we announced in october 2014 that we expect comparable restaurant sales for 2015 in the low to midsingle digit range as opposed to the doubledigit comparable restaurant sales increases we reported for the third quarter of 2014 the price of our common stock declined nearly 7 on the following trading day any future deceleration in or failure to meet market expectations for our comparable restaurant sales increases would likely result in another significant decline in the price of our common stock 

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants in sites and on terms attractive to us which is subject to many unpredictable factors 

we had 1783 restaurants in operation as of december 31 2014 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years and plan to open between 190 and 205 new restaurants in 2015 however we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any one or more of the following factors 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 one of our biggest challenges in opening new restaurants is staffing we seek to hire only topperforming employees and to promote general managers from our crew which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” 

another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for suitable new restaurant sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors could negatively impact our ability to drive occupancy costs lower as a percentage of revenue which would adversely impact our profitability growth in addition any of these factors may be exacerbated by any ongoing economic recovery as developers and contractors see increased demand our decision to delay or forego a significant number of new restaurant openings or our inability to open the number of new restaurants we plan due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our existing restaurant base will decline which will make it increasingly difficult to maintain our past rates of sales and profitability growth 

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods similarly our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area higher fixed costs relating to increased labor and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants and a larger proportion of our recent openings being in higher rent sites than we have historically targeted it may also be difficult for us to attract a customer base if we are not able to staff our restaurants with employees who perform to our high standards if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or 

  

overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable moreover our new restaurant development activity has broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and restaurants in airports food courts or on military sites the risks relating to building a customer base and managing development and operating costs may be more significant in some or all of these types of trade areas or restaurant sites which could have an unexpected negative impact on our new restaurant operating results 

in addition after several years of lowering the average development cost net of landlord reimbursements for new chipotle restaurants in the us from about 916000 in 2008 to about 800000 in 2013 our average developments costs net of landlord reimbursements for new chipotle restaurants in the us have begun to increase in 2014 these costs rose to about 843000 and we expect them to decrease slightly in 2015 in the event we are not able to contain increases in our average restaurant development costs which could result from inflation an increase in the proportion of higher cost locations project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability 

we have now opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market 

our expansion into international markets may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors 

in 2008 we opened our first restaurant outside the us in toronto canada in 2010 we opened our first restaurant in the united kingdom in london in 2012 we opened our first restaurant in france in paris and in 2013 we opened our first restaurant in germany in frankfurt as of december 31 2014 17 of our restaurants were located outside of the us as a result of our small number of restaurants outside the us and the relatively short time we have been operating those restaurants we have lower brand awareness lower sales andor transaction counts and less operating experience in these markets the markets in which we’ve opened restaurants outside the us and any additional new markets we enter outside the us in the future have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our us markets as a result new restaurants outside the us may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets specifically due to lower consumer familiarity with the chipotle brand differences in customer tastes or spending patterns or for other reasons sales at restaurants opened outside the us may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall growth and profitability to build brand awareness in international markets we may need to make greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations in those markets 

we may also find it more difficult in international markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture and labor costs may be higher in international markets due to increased regulation or local market conditions in addition restaurants outside the us have had higher construction occupancy and food costs than restaurants in existing markets and we may have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards markets outside the us may also have regulatory differences with the us with which we are not familiar or that subject us to significant additional expense or to which we are not able to successfully adapt which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could adversely impact our overall results our overall results may also be negatively affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar 

  

shophouse southeast asian kitchen and pizzeria locale may not contribute to our growth 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which chipotle restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 and now have a total of nine shophouse restaurants in washington dc and the los angeles area we also have a majority ownership interest in a company operating two fast casual pizzeria locale restaurants in denver colorado and we plan to invest in and assist with the expansion of pizzeria locale in the future shophouse and pizzeria locale are new brands and they have lower brand awareness lower sales and less operating experience than most chipotle restaurants and may not achieve the same restaurant economics as chipotle restaurants notwithstanding our opening of shophouse and investment in pizzeria locale our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand as a result we do not expect shophouse or pizzeria locale to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years and we may determine not to move forward with any further expansion of shophouse or pizzeria locale this would limit our overall growth over the long term 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

as described elsewhere in this report our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls information systems and personnel may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain general managers crew and corporate staff we also are continuing to attempt to improve our field management in an effort to develop additional topperforming general managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results 

risks related to operating in the restaurant industry 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions global demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and cooking oils has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice increasing our food costs food prices for a number of our key ingredients escalated markedly at various points during 2013 and 2014 and we expect that there will be additional pricing pressures on some of those ingredients primarily beef during 2015 which we expect will be partially or fully offset by relief in dairy prices as a result we expect that food costs as a percentage of revenue in 2015 will remain consistent with the full year 2014 or will increase slightly 

we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and animal welfare criteria or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for food products that are conventionally raised and grown weather related issues such as freezes or drought may also lead to temporary 

  

spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as produce or meats for instance drought conditions in parts of the us have resulted in significant increases in beef prices during 2014 and we expect beef prices to remain high throughout 2015 increasing weather volatility or other longterm changes in global weather patterns including any changes associated with global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales and could also have an adverse impact on our brand 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our general managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits costs including the requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act or the affordable care act discussed further under “ regulatory and legal risks — the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results ” as well as competition increased minimum wage requirements paid sick leave or vacation accrual mandates and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees especially general managers and crew members as we grow we believe we will need to promote or hire additional topperforming field leaders to ensure we hire and motivate good managers and crew and it may be difficult to identify and keep those field leaders our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or erode our employee and restaurant cultures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly and could negatively impact our operations 

various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs as well changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees although we require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers we currently participate in the “everify” program an internetbased free program run by the us government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company however use of everify does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees for example following an audit by the department of homeland security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota during 2010 we lost approximately 450 employees resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations including slower throughput as we trained new employees as well as some degree of negative publicity the resulting broadbased civil and criminal investigations by the us attorney for the district of columbia and us securities and exchange commission of our compliance with work authorization requirements and related disclosures and statements are ongoing see note 9 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” termination of a significant number of employees in specific markets or across our company would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees we could also become subject to 

  

fines penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors 

because we do not franchise risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring payment and termination of employees and employeerelated litigation may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

instances of foodborne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants or result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales and could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat produce or dairy we use to prepare our food 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors may subject us to liability to affected customers and could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry that adversely affects our sales we may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation the risk of illnesses associated with our food might also increase in connection with an expansion of our catering business or other situations in which our food is served in conditions we cannot control 

on a small number of occasions one or more chipotle restaurants have been associated with customer illness and on those occasions our sales have sometimes been adversely impacted at times even in markets beyond those impacted by the illness if our customers become ill from foodborne or localized illnesses or if an illness is attributed to our food even incorrectly we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants further impacting sales in addition reports linking nationwide or regional outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu similarly past outbreaks of e coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems other foodborne illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse effect on the price and availability of affected ingredients a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants would adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability furthermore if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally some of these competitors and other fast casual concepts have sought to duplicate various elements of our business operations and more chains may copy us to varying degrees in the future additionally our newer concepts shophouse southeast asian kitchen and pizzeria locale operate in markets in which there are numerous competitors including a number of large and 

  

wellknown brands a number of other companies or individuals in the restaurant industry have recently opened or invested in fastcasual pizza concepts in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and other dining outlets these competitors may have among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies meeting our specifications could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or deciding not to follow our required protocols or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations in particular shortages of one or more of our menu items could force our restaurants to remove items from their menus which may result in customers choosing to eat elsewhere if that happens our affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the menu item shortage and potentially thereafter if customers do not return to us after the shortage is resolved our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe than at other restaurants 

we have almost no longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on a third party distribution network with a limited number of distribution partners if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason the risk of ingredient shortages may increase and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken tofu beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our food with integrity suppliers and as described in more detail below under “ risks related to our unique business strategy — our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks ” these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

in the first quarter of 2015 through our ongoing auditing of suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards and suspended purchases of pork from this supplier without this supply we do not 

  

have enough pork meeting our specifications for all of our restaurants and a large number of our restaurants are not serving carnitas as of february 4 2015 this may result in lost sales from customers who choose to eat elsewhere rather than substituting a different one of our menu items for carnitas 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods and our focus on a limited menu could make the consequences of a change in consumer preferences more severe than our competitors may face our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels our average restaurant sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty which can be caused by various factors such as high unemployment increasing taxes interest rates or other changes in fiscal or monetary policy high gasoline prices declining home prices tight credit markets or foreign political or economic unrest any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

if we were to experience widespread difficulty renewing existing leases on favorable terms our revenue or occupancy costs could be adversely affected 

we lease substantially all of the properties on which we operate restaurants and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value which could involve substantial increases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals could adversely impact us if we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs reducing our restaurant margins 

regulatory and legal risks 

governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs 

employment and immigration regulations 

we are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules and antidiscrimination laws complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for noncompliance for example a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we could suffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant in addition several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases paid sick leave and mandatory vacation 

  

accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs in addition see “ the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results ” below for a discussion of risks related to recent changes in us healthcare laws 

we also are audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well and recent audit activity and federal criminal and civil investigations in this area are described in more detail above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” as well as in note 9 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees on the other hand in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants we could be found to be in violation of antidiscrimination laws we could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance antidiscrimination compliance or both that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees moreover in addition to the criminal and civil investigations mentioned above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia and the us securities and exchange commission have informed us that they are conducting parallel investigations into possible criminal and civil securities law violations relating to our employee work authorization compliance and related disclosures and statements as well the foregoing investigations may continue to be expensive and distracting and could subject us to fines reputational damage and other liabilities that could be significant 

additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired potential changes in labor laws including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture 

americans with disabilities act and similar state laws 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act or ada and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we have incurred substantial legal fees in connection with adarelated complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws the expenses associated with these modifications or any damages legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ada or similar state laws could be material 

nutrition and food regulation 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and a number of other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available and nationwide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the us health care reform law will go into effect as of december 1 2015 these nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales 

  

privacycybersecurity 

we are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf if the security and information systems of ours or of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees 

local licensure zoning and other regulation 

each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

environmental laws 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

other aspects of regulatory risk 

from time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various laws and regulations that cover our business much of this litigation occurs in california even though currently only about 18 of our restaurants are located there as we continue to expand in california or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in california our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in or minimized our operations in california 

because we do not franchise the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business as described above may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results 

we offer eligible fulltime and parttime us employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us for various reasons many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our 

  

healthcare plans however under the comprehensive us health care reform law enacted in 2010 the affordable care act changes that became effective in 2014 and especially the employer mandate and employer penalties that became effective january 1 2015 may increase our labor costs significantly changes in the law that took effect in 2014 including the imposition of a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage may result in employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in our healthcare plans increasingly finding it advantageous to do so which may increase our healthcare costs in the future in 2015 we adopted a qualifying plan under the affordable care act for our fulltime hourly employees which may further increase our healthcare expenses it is also possible that even in light of recent changes in the healthcare plans we offer healthcare plans offered by other companies with which we compete for employees will make us less attractive to our current or potential employees and in any event implementing the requirements of the affordable care act has imposed some additional administrative costs on us and those costs may increase over time the costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

we’re subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters including wages work hours overtime vacation and family leave discrimination wrongful termination and similar matters and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future our customers also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we’re responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices see “ governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs ” above for additional discussion of these types of claims from time to time we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertising practices we have been subject to a number of these actions and may be subject to additional actions of this type in the future furthermore we have been sued in shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits regarding our financial disclosures and our board’s oversight of our business and as a publiclytraded company we cannot be assured that similar actions will not be brought against us in the future we are also undergoing government investigations as described elsewhere in this report including in note 9 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe the number of many of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers particularly in california regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we’re ultimately held liable for such claims they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations whether directed at us or at fast casual or quickservice restaurants generally may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects which in turn could adversely affect our results 

risks related to our unique business strategy 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice restaurant segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create consumers may also be more pricesensitive during periods of economic difficulty or uncertainty and we experienced some decrease 

  

in traffic during late 2008 and throughout 2009 that we attribute in part to customer resistance to menu price increases if customers are not persuaded that we offer a good value for their money our restaurant transaction counts could be adversely affected which would negatively impact our business results 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

the principle of food with integrity constitutes a significant part of our business strategy we use a substantial amount of ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on practices we believe to be more sustainable or responsible than some conventional practices and try to make food as fresh as we can we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity there can be higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are more responsible farming practices and in some years due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area although all of our restaurants generally serve meat from animals raised in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we may experience shortages of meat particularly chicken or steak meeting these criteria due to suppliers suspending production market conditions or other forces beyond our control a few of our markets have reverted to temporarily serving conventionally raised beef or chicken due to supply shortages including ongoing shortages of beef meeting our protocols during 2013 and early 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015 through our ongoing auditing of suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards and suspended purchases of pork from this supplier without this supply we do not have enough pork meeting our specifications for all of our restaurants and a large number of our restaurants are not serving carnitas as of february 4 2015 

furthermore as we grow the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained moreover we have made a significant commitment to serving local or organic produce when seasonally available and a small portion of our restaurants also serves produce purchased from farmers markets seasonally as well these produce initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent and present additional risk of foodborne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty of imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers quality variations and foodborne illness concerns could adversely impact public perceptions of food with integrity or our brand generally 

if as a result of any of these factors we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with food with integrity which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline our commitment to food with integrity may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our food with integrity approach any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants we may also face adverse publicity or liability for false advertising claims if suppliers do not adhere to all of the elements of our food with integrity programs such as responsible meat protocols requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions if any such supplier failures occur and are publicized our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted 

additionally in response to increasing customer awareness and demand some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones dairy products from cows not treated with rbgh and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our food with integrity 

  

philosophy if competitors become known for using these types of higherquality or more sustainable ingredients it could further limit our supply of these ingredients and may make it more difficult for us to differentiate chipotle and our restaurants which could adversely impact our operating results 

our success may depend on the continued service of key personnel 

our chairman and cochief executive officer steve ells founded our company has been the principal architect of our business strategy and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 1700 restaurants today monty moran our cochief executive officer and jack hartung our chief financial officer have also served with us for several years and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well we believe our executive officers each of whom is an atwill employee without any employment contract have created an employee culture food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team we also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain other executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision if our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted 

our marketing and advertising strategies may not be successful which could adversely impact our business 

we have developed a marketing and advertising strategy that we believe is unique in the restaurant industry we have not generally advertised on television and engage in very limited price or valuebased promotions instead we invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will increase customers’ connection with our brand if these marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant sales the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect in addition our marketing has increasingly incorporated elements intended to encourage customers to question sources or production methods commonly used to produce food these elements of our marketing could alienate food suppliers and other food industry groups and may potentially lead to an increased risk of disputes or litigation if suppliers or other constituencies believe our marketing is unfair or misleading increased costs in connection with any such issues or any deterioration in our relationships with existing suppliers could adversely impact us or our reputation furthermore if these messages do not resonate with our customers or potential customers the value of our brands may be eroded 

we have also implemented strategies such as remote ordering and catering options in an effort to increase overall sales our catering program in particular is new and untested and may not increase our sales to the degree we expect or at all catering and other outofrestaurant sales options also introduce new operating procedures to our restaurants and we may not successfully execute these procedures which could adversely impact the customer experience in our restaurants and thereby harm our sales and customer perception of our brand 

general business risks 

we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2014 approximately 66 of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen including a number of highly publicized incidents with wellknown retailers in recent years in august 2004 the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data as a result we recorded losses and related expenses totaling 43 million from 2004 through 2006 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other 

  

proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

we also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and by the european union and its member states and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf if the security and information systems of ours or of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability property damage and auto liability we are selfinsured for our employee health plans but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability property damage and auto liability insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

negative publicity relating to our restaurants or our company could adversely impact our reputation which may significantly harm us 

we depend in part on customers’ perception of and connection to our brand we may experience negative publicity from time to time relating to food quality customer complaints restaurant facilities advertising and other business practices litigation alleging illness or injury regulatory issues our suppliers’ potential failure to adhere to elements of our food with integrity protocols other issues regarding the integrity of our suppliers’ food processing employee relationships or other matters regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held to be responsible the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one or more restaurants or any of the foregoing topics may extend far beyond the restaurants involved and affect many more or even all of our restaurants the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated a similar risk exists with respect to unrelated food service businesses if consumers associate those businesses with our own operations 

negative publicity may adversely impact customers’ perception of us which could adversely impact our sales if the impact of any such negative publicity is particularly longlasting the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished additionally negative publicity about our employment practices 

  

may affect our reputation among employees and potential employees which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain topperforming employees that could adversely impact the quality of the customer experience we can offer and our operations generally and may increase our labor costs as well 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos our food with integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors because of various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading days—that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall we believe the market price of our common stock which has generally traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most or all of our peer companies reflects high market expectations for our future operating results the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times as well as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend you should read the following discussion together with item 6 “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the discussion contains forwardlooking statements involving risks uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations factors that might cause such differences include those described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

overview 

chipotle operates fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees enables us to develop future leaders from within 

2014 highlights and trends 

restaurant development  as of december 31 2014 we had 1783 restaurants in operation including 1755 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states with an additional seven in canada six in england three in france and one in germany our restaurants include nine shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants serving asianinspired cuisine and we are an investor in a consolidated entity that owns and operates two pizzeria locale restaurants a fast casual pizza concept new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth and we opened 192 restaurants in 2014 and expect to open between 190 and 205 restaurants in 2015 including a small number of shophouse and pizzeria locale restaurants 

sales growth  average restaurant sales were 2472 million as of december 31 2014 increasing from 2169 million as of december 31 2013 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months our comparable restaurant sales increases were 168 in 2014 comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation comparable restaurant sales increases in 2014 were driven primarily by an increase in customer visits and to a lesser extent from an increase in average check including the impact of a menu price increase during the second quarter of 2014 at all us chipotle locations menu price increases accounted for 38 of our comparable restaurant sales increases for 2014 we expect 2015 comparable restaurant sales to be in the low to midsingle digits as comparisons become more difficult particularly during the final three quarters of the year 

during 2013 we launched our catering service in chipotle restaurants throughout the us except new york city catering represented approximately 13 of revenue for the year ended 2014 

food with integrity in all of our restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones and in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we brand these meats as “responsibly raised tm ” in addition a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown andor sourced locally when in season by which we mean within 350 miles of the restaurant where it is served and a portion of the beans we serve is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which they are grown the sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh milk used to make much of our 

  

cheese and all of our sour cream is sourced from pasturebased dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows further we disclose on our website which ingredients contain genetically modified organisms or gmos and we are working to replace ingredients containing gmos in our food not including beverages with nongmo ingredients while the meat and poultry we serve is not genetically modified the animals are likely fed a diet containing gmos we will continue to search for quality ingredients that not only taste delicious but also benefit local farmers or the environment or otherwise benefit or improve the sustainability of our supply chain 

one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to continue serving meats that are raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so in january 2015 through an ongoing audit of our suppliers we identified a pork supplier that was not meeting our standards related to the size and condition of the housing offered to some of the pigs so we suspended our purchases from this supplier without this supply we cannot get enough pork that meets our standards for all of our restaurants and we will not be able to serve carnitas in about onethird of our us restaurants until we can find additional sources which meet our standards to make up the shortfall because we have elected to remove all affected pork from our supply chain including our distribution centers and—because the meat is food safe but does not meet our rigorous standards—we disposed of it primarily through donations to local food banks some of our restaurants served conventionally raised beef and chicken for periods during 2014 and we expect to serve conventionally raised beef in 2015 due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised meats more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

our food costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2014 as a result of inflationary pressures on many of our ingredients primarily beef avocados and dairy the increase was partially offset by the impact of the menu price increase in the second quarter we expect that food costs as a percentage of revenue in 2015 will remain consistent with the full year 2014 or will increase slightly 

stock repurchases in accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors we purchased shares of our common stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of 880 million during 2014 as of december 31 2014 1022 million was available to be repurchased under the current repurchase authorizations announced on february 5 2013 and april 17 2014 on february 3 2015 we announced that our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to an additional 100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b51c authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time subject to market conditions the existing repurchase agreement and the board’s authorization of the repurchases may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 

 

   

results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as our business grows as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase 

revenue 

 

 in 2014 the significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings comparable restaurant sales increases contributed 5300 million of the increase in restaurant sales due primarily to increases in customer visits and an increase in average check price including the benefit from menu price increases restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed 3647 million of the increase in sales in 2014 of which 1739 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year 

in 2013 the significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed 3339 million of the increase in sales of which 1566 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2013 comparable restaurant sales increases contributed 1503 million of the increase in restaurant sales due primarily to increases in customer visits 

food beverage and packaging costs 

 

 food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2014 due to inflation on many food items primarily beef avocados and dairy the increase was partially offset by the impact of menu price increases we expect that food costs as a percentage of revenue in 2015 will remain consistent with the full year 2014 or will increase slightly 

food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2013 due to inflation on many food items particularly salsa ingredients as well as dairy cooking oils and chicken 

  

labor costs 

 

 labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2014 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales including the impact of menu price increases partially offset by an increased number of managers and crew in our restaurants and normal wage inflation in 2015 we expect labor costs to increase slightly as a percentage of revenue due to the affordable care act and minimum wage increases in a number of jurisdictions 

labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2013 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales 

occupancy costs 

 

 occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2014 and in 2013 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

other operating costs 

 

 other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs bank and credit card fees and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs other operating costs decreased in 2014 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base we expect marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue for 2015 to remain consistent with the full year 2014 or increase slightly 

other operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2013 due primarily to higher spend on marketing and promotions 

general and administrative expenses 

 

   

the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2014 primarily resulted from increased noncash stockbased compensation expense higher payroll and bonus costs as we grew as well costs from our biennial all managers’ conference or amc held in the third quarter of 2014 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2013 primarily resulted from increased payroll and benefits costs as we grew and increased legal costs partially offset by costs from our biennial amc held during 2012 as well as a decrease in 2013 in noncash stock based compensation expense due to expenses in 2012 related to nonvested stock awards subject to performance conditions 

depreciation and amortization 

 

 as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization decreased in 2014 and 2013 as a result of the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

income tax provision 

 

 the 2014 effective tax rate decreased by 11 from 2013 due to a decrease in the state tax rate and filing the 2013 tax returns which included a change in the estimate of usable employer credits 

the 2013 effective tax rate decreased by 06 from 2012 due primarily to certain federal tax credits that were extended in 2013 for both 2013 and 2012 which benefited the rate by 11 this decrease was partially offset by nonrecurring adjustments related to state income taxes 

we estimate our 2015 annual effective tax rate will be 390 increasing from 2014 due to the expiration of certain federal tax credits 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2014 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

 

   

 seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year seasonal factors however might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results such as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results overall on an annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of noncash stockbased compensation expense the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs we have a cash and shortterm investment balance of 7581 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions including up to 1022 million in repurchases under programs authorized as of december 31 2014 and an additional 100 million program announced on february 3 2015 to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes we also have a long term investments balance of 4961 million which consists of us treasury notes and certificate of deposit products with maturities of 13 months to approximately 2 years we believe that cash from operations together with our cash and investment balances will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

while operations continue to provide cash our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development our total capital expenditures for 2014 were 2526 million which included the purchase of a corporate aircraft for a total cost of approximately 24 million the majority of that amount was paid during 2014 we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 235 million in 2015 of which about 180 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments in 2014 for chipotle restaurants in the us we spent on average about 843000 in development and construction costs per restaurant net of landlord reimbursements of approximately 60000 and for all restaurants including international locations we spent on average about 849000 net of landlord reimbursements of approximately 66000 for new restaurants to be opened in 2015 we anticipate average development costs will slightly decrease due primarily to the mix of locations and categories 

  

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 were as follows 

 

  

 we’re obligated under noncancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food healthcare costs labor fuel utility costs materials used in the construction of our restaurants and insurance although almost all of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs additionally many of our leases require us to pay taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases inflationary increases have increased our food beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue for the past three years these increases have been partially offset with menu price increases 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense 

  

on a straightline basis over the reasonably assured lease term the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights or sosars which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards and sosars with performancebased vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different 

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for workers’ compensation general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as 1 million and for property which generally has a 15 million deductible we are self insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2014 were 340 million 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2014 and 2013 although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend commodity price risks 

we are also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices however a majority of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance

we are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2014 we had 9811 million in investments and interestbearing cash accounts including an insurance related restricted trust account classified in other assets and 2622 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 043 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is limited at this date

 item 1 business tableend general 

chipotle mexican grill inc and its subsidiaries “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operate chipotle mexican grill restaurants which serve a focused menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads made using fresh ingredients as of december 31 2013 we operated 1572 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states as well as seven in canada six in england two in france and one in germany additionally our restaurants include six shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants serving asianinspired cuisine and we are an investor in a consolidated entity that owns and operates one pizzeria locale a fast casual pizza concept resulting in a total of 1595 restaurants as of december 31 2013 we focus on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on building a special people culture that is centered on creating a team of top performers empowered to achieve high standards on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment we have grown substantially over the past five years and expect to open between 180 and 195 additional restaurants in 2014 including a small number of shophouse andor pizzeria locale restaurants 

our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

we manage our operations and restaurants based on seven regions that aggregate into one reportable segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 and our total assets as of december 31 2013 and 2012 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the us for a discussion of risks related to our international operations see “ risks related to our growth strategy and future expansion—our expansion into international markets may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors ” in item 1a risk factors 

our menu and food preparation 

food with integrity serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food as part of our food with integrity philosophy we believe that purchasing fresh ingredients and preparing them by hand are not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on the sources of each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food 

in all of our restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones and in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we brand these meats as “responsibly raised tm ” one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to serve meats raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so some of our restaurants served conventionally raised beef and chicken for periods during 2013 and some are continuing to serve conventionally raised beef due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised meats more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to additional supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

  

we also seek to use more sustainably grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown andor sourced locally while in season by which we mean grown within 350 miles of the restaurant where it is served a portion of our beans is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown our commitment to food with integrity extends to the dairy products we serve as well the sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh recombinant bovine growth hormone also milk used to make much of our cheese and sour cream is sourced from pasturebased dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows further we disclose on our website which ingredients contain genetically modified organisms or gmos and we are working to replace ingredients containing gmos in our food not including beverages with nongmo ingredients while the meat and poultry we serve is not genetically modified the animals are likely fed a diet containing gmos because of the prevalence of gmos in a number of important feed crops most grains used as animal feed in the us are genetically modified 

we do face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality environmental sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are responsible farming practices many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area however we believe that in addition to seeking great tasting and nutritious food consumers are increasingly concerned about where their food comes from and how it is raised and we believe that as consumers become more educated about better animal welfare and farming practices as well as social accountability they will foster greater demand for sustainably grown foods in the long term we believe that increased demand over the long term for the types of meat and produce items we strive to serve will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers we also understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if we are able to continue growing while focusing on food with integrity our sourcing flexibility should improve over time though we expect that most of these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than conventionally raised commoditypriced equivalents 

a few things thousands of ways chipotle restaurants serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices we plan to keep a simple menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense such as the recent introduction in select markets of sofritas our new vegan protein option made with braised organic tofu and if customers can’t find something on the menu that’s quite what they’re after we encourage them to let us know if we can make it from the ingredients we have we’ll do it 

in preparing our food we use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated and grilled in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef and vegetarian pinto and black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime juice and kosher salt in addition to sodas fruit drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in larger batches in commissaries 

  

food served fast … so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that prepared the food and are assembling the order while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a typical “fastfood” experience and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we do this by focusing on what we call the “four pillars” of throughput the four pillars are having a dedicated expeditor who works just before the cashier to get drink and side orders and bag togo orders a dedicated linebacker to make sure the serving line is stocked with all our ingredients so the employees on the line can focus on each customer’s order proper mise en place  and ensuring that we have “aces in their places” or the best employees at each position during all of our peak periods when we do this our customers are served quickly without feeling rushed we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we constantly strive to improve the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic for instance our restaurants accept orders by fax online or through an iphone or android ordering application in order to provide a more convenient experience by allowing customers to avoid standing in line by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our restaurant operations we believe that we can provide a high quality experience to more and more customers 

quality assurance and food safety we are committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs for our supply chain our training and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations 

restaurant management and operations 

culture of top performers in addition to our focus on the food we serve we have a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying hiring and empowering top performing employees we are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our employees and our customers the foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best people in our restaurants we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards yet allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we believe we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower a team of top performers we provide hands on shouldertoshoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees we are committed to developing our people and promoting from within with about 85 of salaried management and about 96 of hourly management coming from internal promotions our best general managers who run great restaurants and develop strong empowered restaurant teams are promoted to restaurateur and in that role can earn bonuses for developing people we’ve leveraged our outstanding restaurateurs’ leadership by giving many restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring one or more nearby restaurants this provides an opportunity for restaurateurs to develop field leadership roles one restaurant at a time restaurateurs who have shown they can successfully run four restaurants by developing teams of all top performers including at least one restaurateur thereby creating a culture of high standards constant improvement and empowerment in each of their restaurants can be promoted to apprentice team leaders 

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques and microwaves used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats handcut 

  

produce and herbs make fresh salsa and guacamole and cook rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a typical fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants 

the front line is key  our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service and our open kitchen design allows customers to see that we prepare our food fresh each and every day all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to interact with customers no matter their job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among general managers crew members and customers alike 

the basics each restaurant typically has a general manager a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an apprentice manager in more than threequarters of our restaurants one to three hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 23 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our general managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes apprentice team leaders team leaders or area managers team directors executive team directors or regional directors and restaurant support officers 

supply chain 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our 23 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and their understanding of our mission and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with suppliers we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols and our distribution centers purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages and we follow industry news trade issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas are purchased from a small number of suppliers 

distribution arrangements ingredients and other supplies are delivered to our restaurants by our independently owned and operated regional distribution centers 

marketing 

a great dining experience in our restaurants is our most powerful marketing of all but there is still a need to introduce our brand to consumers and to help them understand what makes chipotle different than other restaurants so we pay close attention to all of these details monitoring customer sentiment and awareness of chipotle and keeping our communications closely aligned with the ways our customers experience our brand our advertising and promotional programs instore communications and other design elements all help to communicate something about what makes chipotle different from other fast food companies whether it’s engaging with our company via social media participating in our local events or simply eating a burrito at one of our restaurants each interaction with a customer affords us an important opportunity to build our brand 

our advertising has generally included print outdoor transit and radio ads but we are also incorporating online advertising into the mix and adding strategic promotions that demonstrate how chipotle is different than 

  

other restaurant concepts or that connect us to likeminded individuals or organizations beyond these traditional means we are continuing to explore and pioneer new avenues of branded content aimed at educating consumers about issues that are important to us and explaining why we are working to drive positive change in the nation’s food supply in addition we continue to generate considerable media coverage with scores of publications writing favorably about our food restaurant concept and business 

we also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture to this end we have been developing more “owned media” including new video and music programs and a more visible event strategy that includes our “cultivate” festivals of food music and ideas and participation in relevant events in markets around the country many of these newer programs allow us to tell our story with more nuance than is afforded by traditional advertising and help forge stronger emotional connections with our customers we are also increasing our use of digital mobile and social media to our overall marketing mix giving customers greater opportunity to access chipotle in ways that are convenient for them and broadening our ability to engage with our customers individually 

collectively these efforts and our excellent restaurant teams have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity with our customers learning about us and telling others allowing us to build awareness and loyalty with relatively low advertising expenditures even in a competitive category and to differentiate chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right things in every facet of our business 

competition 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally unlike us a number of our competitors grow through franchising 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends including increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared and the increasing prevalence of the fastcasual segment some of our competitors have formats that might resemble ours but we believe that chipotle has become one of the most recognized fastcasual restaurants and that we are known for our focus on having teams of topperforming employees prepare food using a variety of fresh ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food as well as our commitment to “food with integrity” which we think adds up to a high quality customer experience in our restaurants we believe these elements represent significant competitive advantages in the segment in which we operate 

restaurant site selection 

we believe that site selection is critical to our success and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential location our site selection process includes the use of external real estate brokers with 

  

expertise in specific markets taking direction from our internal team of real estate managers locations proposed by real estate managers are reviewed by development management and at times leaders from operations as part of a formal site ride as well as in a written real estate package we study the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and available information on competitors based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as inline or endcap locations in strip or power centers in regional malls and downtown business districts freestanding buildings food courts and airports our new restaurant development activity has broadened to incorporate trade areas or restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and on military sites 

shophouse southeast asian kitchen and pizzeria locale 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle 

in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened our first shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 and we opened five additional shophouse restaurants during 2013 shophouse serves a menu that like at chipotle is focused main dishes consist of rice or noodle bowls made with steak chicken meatballs made with pork and chicken or tofu further during 2013 we invested in a consolidated entity that owns and operates one pizzeria locale a fast casual pizza concept serving a menu that includes classic pizzas and salads from a selection of highquality ingredients 

notwithstanding our opening of shophouse and investment in pizzeria locale and our plans in 2014 for a small number of additional shophouse andor pizzeria locale restaurants our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year 

our intellectual property and trademarks

information systems 

we use an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and our corporate offices and which is accessible remotely by our field staff this system includes a pointofsales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant additionally the pointofsales system is used to authorize batch and transmit credit card transactions to record employee time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to our corporate offices on a daily basis which enables management to continually monitor operating results we believe that our current pointofsales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion see “risk factors—general business risks— we may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information ” below for a discussion of certain risks associated with our pointofsales systems 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we had about 45340 employees including about 3740 salaried employees and about 41600 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

risks related to our growth strategy and future expansion 

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales increases are less than we expect and we may not successfully increase comparable restaurant sales or they may decrease 

while future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants changes in comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases we expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2014 to be in the low to midsingle digits excluding any menu price increases due in part to difficult comparisons with 2013 

our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 as a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative a number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases 

past declines in our comparable restaurant sales increases have significantly impacted our stock price beginning in the second quarter of 2012 prior to which we had been experiencing strong comparable restaurant sales growth momentum our comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated and the price of our stock declined significantly in the wake of this deceleration including a decline of nearly 22 on the trading day following our second quarter 2012 earnings release any future deceleration in or failure to meet market expectations for our comparable restaurant sales increases would likely result in another significant decline in the price of our common stock 

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants in sites and on terms attractive to us which is subject to many unpredictable factors 

there were 1595 restaurants in operation as of december 31 2013 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years and plan to open between 180 and 195 new restaurants in 2014 however we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 one of our biggest challenges in opening new restaurants is staffing we seek to hire only topperforming employees and to promote general managers from our crew which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” 

another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for suitable new restaurant sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors may be exacerbated by any ongoing economic uncertainty as developers may continue to delay or be unable to finance new projects delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline which may in turn slow our sales and profitability growth 

  

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods similarly our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area higher fixed costs relating to increased labor and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants and a larger proportion of our recent openings being in higher rent sites than we have historically targeted it may also be difficult for us to attract a customer base if we are not able to staff our restaurants with employees who perform to our high standards if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable we also have lowered the average development cost net of landlord reimbursements for new chipotle restaurants in the us significantly in recent years from about 916000 in 2008 to about 800000 in 2013 in 2014 we expect average development costs to increase about 5 in the event we are not able to achieve the average development costs we expect for 2014 or sustain the benefits achieved in prior years which could result from inflation project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability additionally our new restaurant development activity has broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and restaurants in airports food courts or on military sites the risks relating to building a customer base and managing development and operating costs may be more significant in some or all of these types of trade areas or restaurant sites 

in addition we have now opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market 

our expansion into international markets may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors 

in 2008 we opened our first restaurant outside the us in toronto canada in 2010 we opened our first restaurant in the united kingdom in london in 2012 we opened our first restaurant in france in paris and in 2013 we opened our first restaurant in germany in frankfurt as of december 31 2013 16 of our restaurants were located outside of the us as a result of our small number of restaurants outside the us and the relatively short time we have been operating those restaurants we have lower brand awareness lower sales andor transaction counts and less operating experience in these markets the markets in which we’ve opened restaurants outside the us and any additional new markets we enter outside the us in the future have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our us markets as a result new restaurants outside the us may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets specifically due to lower consumer familiarity with the chipotle brand differences in customer tastes or spending patterns or for other reasons sales at restaurants opened outside the us may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall profitability to build brand awareness in international markets we may need to make greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations in those markets 

  

we may also find it more difficult in international markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture in addition restaurants outside the us have had higher construction occupancy and operating costs than restaurants in existing markets and we may have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards markets outside the us may also have regulatory differences with the us with which we are not familiar or that subject us to significant additional expense or to which we are not able to successfully adapt which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could adversely impact our overall results our overall results may also be affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar 

shophouse southeast asian kitchen and pizzeria locale may not contribute to our growth 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which chipotle restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 and now have a total of six shophouse restaurants in washington dc and the los angeles area we also announced in late 2013 that we have invested in a company operating a new fast casual pizzeria locale restaurant in denver colorado and that we plan to invest in and assist with the expansion of pizzeria locale in the future shophouse and pizzeria locale are new brands and they have lower brand awareness lower sales and less operating experience than most chipotle restaurants and may not achieve the same restaurant economics as chipotle restaurants notwithstanding our opening of shophouse and investment in pizzeria locale our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand as a result we do not expect shophouse or pizzeria locale to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years and we may determine not to move forward with any further expansion of shophouse or pizzeria locale this would limit our overall growth over the long term 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

as described elsewhere in this report our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls information systems and personnel may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain general managers crew and corporate staff we also are continuing to attempt to improve our field management in an effort to develop additional topperforming general managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results 

risks related to operating in the restaurant industry 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions global demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and cooking oils has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice increasing our food costs food prices for a number of our key 

  

ingredients escalated markedly at various points during 2013 and we expect that there will be additional pricing pressures on some of those ingredients including avocados beef dairy and chicken during 2014 we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and responsibility criteria or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for commodity food products weather related issues such as freezes or drought may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as produce or meats for instance two years of drought conditions in parts of the us have resulted in significant increases in beef prices during late 2013 and early 2014 increasing weather volatility or other longterm changes in global weather patterns including any changes associated with global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales and could also have an adverse impact on our brand 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our general managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits costs including the requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act or the affordable care act discussed further under “ regulatory and legal risks — the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results ” as well as competition increased minimum wage requirements paid sick leave or vacation accrual mandates and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees especially general managers and crew members as we grow we believe we will need to promote or hire additional topperforming field leaders to ensure we hire and motivate good managers and crew and it may be difficult to identify and keep those field leaders our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or erode our employee and restaurant cultures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly and could negatively impact our operations 

various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs as well changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees although we require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers we currently participate in the “everify” program an internetbased free program run by the us government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company however use of everify does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees for example following an audit by the department of homeland security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota during 2010 we lost approximately 450 employees resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations including slower throughput as we trained new employees as well as some degree of negative publicity the resulting broadbased civil and criminal investigations by the us attorney for 

  

the district of columbia and us securities and exchange commission of our compliance with work authorization requirements and related disclosures and statements are ongoing see note 9 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” termination of a significant number of employees in specific markets or across our company would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees we could also become subject to fines penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws our financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors 

because we do not franchise risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring payment and termination of employees and employeerelated litigation may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

instances of foodborne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants or result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales and could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat produce or dairy we use to prepare our food 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors may subject us to liability to affected customers and could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry that adversely affects our sales for instance on a small number of occasions a chipotle restaurant has been associated with customer illness and on those occasions our sales have been adversely impacted at times even in markets beyond those impacted by the illness we may be at a higher risk for foodborne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation if our customers become ill from foodborne or localized illnesses or if an illness is attributed to our food even incorrectly we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants in addition reports linking nationwide or regional outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu similarly past outbreaks of e coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems other foodborne illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse affect on the price and availability of affected ingredients a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants would adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability furthermore if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability the risk of illnesses associated with our food might increase in connection with an expansion of our catering business or other situations in which our food is served in conditions we cannot control 

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than 

  

we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally some of these competitors and other fast casual concepts have sought to duplicate various elements of our business operations and more chains may copy us to varying degrees in the future additionally our newer concepts shophouse southeast asian kitchen and pizzeria locale operate in markets in which there are numerous competitors including a number of large and wellknown brands a number of other companies or individuals in the restaurant industry have recently opened or invested in fastcasual pizza concepts in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations we have almost no longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on a third party distribution network with a limited number of distribution partners if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our food with integrity suppliers and as described in more detail below under “ risks related to our unique business strategy—we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food ” these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the 

  

restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods and our focus on a limited menu could make the consequences of a change in consumer preferences more severe than our competitors may face our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels our average restaurant sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty which can be caused by various factors such as high unemployment increasing taxes interest rates or other changes in fiscal or monetary policy high gasoline prices declining home prices tight credit markets or foreign political or economic unrest any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

if we were to experience widespread difficulty renewing existing leases on favorable terms our revenue or occupancy costs could be adversely affected 

we lease substantially all of the properties on which we operate restaurants and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value which could involve substantial increases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals could adversely impact us if we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs reducing our restaurant margins 

regulatory and legal risks 

governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs 

employment and immigration regulations 

we are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules and antidiscrimination laws complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for noncompliance for example a number of lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we could suffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend these or similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant in addition several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs in addition see “ the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results ” below for a discussion of risks related to recent changes in us healthcare laws 

we also are audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well and recent audit activity and federal criminal and civil investigations in this area are described in more detail above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” as well as in note 9 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements 

  

included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees on the other hand in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants we could be found to be in violation of antidiscrimination laws we could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance antidiscrimination compliance or both that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees moreover in addition to the criminal and civil investigations mentioned above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia and the us securities and exchange commission have informed us that they are conducting parallel investigations into possible criminal and civil securities law violations relating to our employee work authorization compliance and related disclosures and statements as well all of the foregoing investigations will continue to be expensive and distracting and could subject us to fines reputational damage and other liabilities that could be significant 

additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired potential changes in labor laws including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture 

americans with disabilities act and similar state laws 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act or ada and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we have incurred substantial legal fees in connection with adarelated complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws the expenses associated with these modifications or any damages legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ada or similar state laws could be material 

nutrition and food regulation 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and a number of other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available the us health care reform law included nationwide menu labeling and nutrition disclosure requirements as well and our restaurants will be covered by these national requirements when they go into effect which may be as early as 2014 initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales 

local licensure zoning and other regulation 

each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned 

  

restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

environmental laws 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

other aspects of regulatory risk 

from time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various laws and regulations that cover our business much of this litigation occurs in california even though currently only about 18 of our restaurants are located there as we continue to expand in california or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in california our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in or minimized our operations in california 

because we do not franchise the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business as described above may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies at which some or all of these risks are borne by franchisees or other operating contractors 

the effect of recent changes to us healthcare laws may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results 

we offer eligible fulltime and parttime us employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us for various reasons many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans however under the comprehensive us health care reform law enacted in 2010 the affordable care act changes that become effective in 2014 and especially the employer mandate and employer penalties that are scheduled to become effective in 2015 may increase our labor costs significantly changes in the law for 2014 including the imposition of a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage may result in employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in our healthcare plans now finding it more advantageous to do so which may increase our healthcare costs in 2015 we will either adopt a qualifying plan under the affordable care act for our fulltime hourly employees which will likely increase our healthcare expenses significantly or we will be subject to employer penalties which could also significantly increase our labor costs it is also possible that making changes or failing to make changes in the healthcare plans we offer will make us less attractive to our current or potential employees and in any event implementing the requirements of the affordable care act is likely to impose some additional administrative costs on us the costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

we’re subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters including wages work hours overtime vacation and family leave discrimination 

  

wrongful termination and similar matters and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future our customers also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we’re responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices see “ governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs ” above for additional discussion of these types of claims from time to time we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertising practices we have been subject to a number of these actions and may be subject to additional actions of this type in the future we are also undergoing government investigations as described elsewhere in this report including in note 9 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe the number of many of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers particularly in california regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we’re ultimately held liable for such claims they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations whether directed at us or at fast casual or quickservice restaurants generally may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects which in turn could adversely affect our results 

risks related to our unique business strategy 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice restaurant segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create consumers may also be more pricesensitive during periods of economic difficulty or uncertainty and we experienced some decrease in traffic during late 2008 and throughout 2009 that we attribute in part to menu price increases recent reports have indicated continued consumer uncertainty that may persist during 2014 so our ability to increase menu prices or customer visits may be significantly hampered for the foreseeable future we have announced that we are likely to increase menu prices during 2014 and if we do so it may adversely impact our customer traffic 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

the principle of food with integrity constitutes a significant part of our business strategy we use a substantial amount of ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on practices we believe to be more sustainable or responsible than some conventional practices and try to make food as fresh as we can we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are more responsible farming practices and in some years due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area although all of our restaurants generally serve meat from animals raised in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal 

  

welfare we may experience shortages of meat particularly chicken or steak meeting these criteria due to suppliers suspending production market conditions or other forces beyond our control a few of our markets have reverted to temporarily serving conventionally raised beef or chicken due to supply shortages including ongoing shortages of beef meeting our protocols during 2013 and early 2014 furthermore as we grow the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained moreover we have made a significant commitment to serving local or organic produce when seasonally available and a small portion of our restaurants also serves produce purchased from farmers markets seasonally as well these produce initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent and present additional risk of foodborne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty of imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers quality variations and foodborne illness concerns could adversely impact public perceptions of food with integrity or our brand generally 

if as a result of any of these factors we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with food with integrity which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline our commitment to food with integrity may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our food with integrity approach any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants we may also face adverse publicity or liability for false advertising claims if suppliers do not adhere to all of the elements of our food with integrity programs such as responsible meat protocols requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions if any such supplier failures occur and are publicized our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted 

additionally in response to increasing customer awareness and demand some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones dairy products from cows not treated with rbgh and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our food with integrity philosophy if competitors become known for using these types of higherquality or more sustainable ingredients it could further limit our supply of these ingredients and may make it more difficult for us to differentiate chipotle and our restaurants which could adversely impact our operating results 

our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

our chairman and cochief executive officer steve ells founded our company has been the principal architect of our business strategy and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 1500 restaurants today monty moran our cochief executive officer and jack hartung our chief financial officer have also served with us for several years and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well we believe our executive officers each of whom is an atwill employee without any employment contract have created an employee culture food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team we also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision if our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted 

our marketing and advertising strategies may not be successful which could adversely impact our business 

we have developed a marketing and advertising strategy that we believe is unique in the restaurant industry we have not generally advertised on television and engage in very limited price or valuebased promotions instead we invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will increase customers’ connection with our brand if these marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant sales the 

  

expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect in addition our marketing has increasingly incorporated elements intended to encourage customers to question sources or production methods commonly used to produce food these elements of our marketing could alienate food suppliers and other food industry groups and may potentially lead to an increased risk of disputes or litigation if suppliers or other constituencies believe our marketing is unfair or misleading increased costs in connection with any such issues or any deterioration in our relationships with existing suppliers could adversely impact us or our reputation furthermore if these messages do not resonate with our customers or potential customers the value of our brands may be eroded 

we have also implemented strategies such as remote ordering and catering options in an effort to increase overall sales our catering program in particular is new and untested and may not increase our sales to the degree we expect or at all catering and other outofrestaurant sales options also introduce new operating procedures to our restaurants and we may not successfully execute these procedures which could adversely impact the customer experience in our restaurants and thereby harm our sales and customer perception of our brand 

general business risks 

we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2013 approximately 64 of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen including a number of highly publicized incidents with wellknown retailers in late 2013 and early 2014 in august 2004 the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data as a result we recorded losses and related expenses totaling 43 million from 2004 through 2006 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

we also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding at the same time we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf if the security and information systems of ours or of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties which could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability property damage and auto liability we are selfinsured for our employee health plans but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability property damage and auto liability insurance 

  

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

negative publicity relating to our restaurants or our company could adversely impact our reputation which may significantly harm us 

we depend in part on customers’ perception of and connection to our brand we may experience negative publicity from time to time relating to food quality customer complaints restaurant facilities advertising and other business practices litigation alleging illness or injury regulatory issues our suppliers’ potential failure to adhere to elements of our food with integrity protocols other issues regarding the integrity of our suppliers’ food processing employee relationships or other matters regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held to be responsible the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one or more restaurants or any of the foregoing topics may extend far beyond the restaurants involved and affect many more or even all of our restaurants the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated a similar risk exists with respect to unrelated food service businesses if consumers associate those businesses with our own operations 

negative publicity may adversely impact customers’ perception of us which could adversely impact our sales if the impact of any such negative publicity is particularly longlasting the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished additionally negative publicity about our employment practices may affect our reputation among employees and potential employees which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain topperforming employees that could adversely impact the quality of the customer experience we can offer and our operations generally and may increase our labor costs as well 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos our food with integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors because of various factors including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading days—that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall we believe the market price of our common stock which has generally traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most or all of our peer companies reflects high market expectations for our future operating results the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times as well as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

overview 

chipotle operates fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees enables us to develop future leaders from within 

2013 highlights and trends 

restaurant development  as of december 31 2013 we had 1595 restaurants in operation including 1572 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states with an additional seven in canada six in england two in france and one in germany our restaurants include six shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants serving asianinspired cuisine and we are an investor in a consolidated entity that owns and operates one pizzeria locale a fast casual pizza concept new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth and we opened 185 restaurants in 2013 and expect to open between 180 and 195 restaurants in 2014 including a small number of shophouse andor pizzeria locale restaurants 

sales growth  average restaurant sales were 2169 million as of december 31 2013 increasing from 2113 million as of december 31 2012 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months our comparable restaurant sales increases were 56 in 2013 comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation comparable restaurant sales increases in 2013 were driven primarily by an increase in customer visits we expect 2014 comparable restaurant sales to be in the low to midsingle digits assuming we do not increase menu prices based on continued food cost inflation we are likely to increase menu prices at some point during 2014 most likely the second half of the year 

during 2013 we launched our catering service in chipotle restaurants throughout the us except new york city where we expect to introduce catering later in 2014 catering represented approximately 1 of sales in markets in which catering was offered during the fourth quarter 

food with integrity in all of our restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones and in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we brand these meats as “responsibly raised tm ” in addition a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown andor sourced locally when in season by which we mean within 350 miles of the restaurant where it is served and a portion of the beans we serve is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which they are grown the sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh milk used to make much of our cheese and our sour cream is sourced from pasturebased dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows further we disclose on our website which ingredients 

  

contain genetically modified organisms or gmos and we are working to replace ingredients containing gmos in our food not including beverages with nongmo ingredients while the meat and poultry we serve is not genetically modified the animals are likely fed a diet containing gmos we will continue to search for quality ingredients that not only taste delicious but also benefit local farmers or the environment or otherwise benefit or improve the sustainability of our supply chain 

one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to continue serving meats that are raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so some of our restaurants served conventionally raised beef and chicken for periods during 2013 and some are continuing to serve conventionally raised beef due to supply constraints for our responsibly raised meats more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

our food costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2013 as a result of inflationary pressures on many of our ingredients particularly salsa ingredients as well as dairy cooking oils and chicken we expect that food cost inflation will continue into 2014 

stock repurchases in accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors we purchased shares of our common stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of 1100 million during 2013 as of december 31 2013 902 million was available to be repurchased under the current repurchase authorization announced on february 5 2013 we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b51c authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time subject to market conditions the existing repurchase agreement and the board’s authorization of the repurchases may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

on november 20 2012 we entered into a privately negotiated accelerated share repurchase transaction “asr” to repurchase 25 million of our common stock we advanced the 25 million upon commencement of the transaction and received 65187 shares which represented 70 of the total number of shares to be repurchased calculated using the closing price on the commencement date the agreement was settled in february 2013 and we received an additional 21860 shares resulting in a weightedaverage share price per share of 28720 for the asr 

restaurant openings relocations and closures 

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 

 

 results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as our business grows as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase 

  

revenue 

 

 the significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed 3339 million of the increase in sales in 2013 of which 1566 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year in 2012 restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed 3047 million of the increase in sales of which 1348 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2012 

comparable restaurant sales increases contributed 1503 million and 1564 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2013 and 2012 respectively comparable restaurant sales growth in 2013 was due primarily to increases in customer visits and comparable restaurant sales growth in 2012 was due primarily to increases in customer visits as well as the impact of menu price increases 

food beverage and packaging costs 

 

 food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2013 due to inflation on many food items particularly salsa ingredients as well as dairy cooking oils and chicken we expect that food cost inflation will continue into 2014 

food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2012 due to inflation on many food items primarily beef chicken and rice and initiatives to improve the taste and quality of our food the increase was partially offset by the impact of menu price increases and relief in avocado prices 

labor costs 

 

 labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2013 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales 

  

labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2012 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales including the impact of menu price increases partially offset by increased average wage rates 

occupancy costs 

 

 occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2013 and in 2012 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

other operating costs 

 

 other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs bank and credit card fees and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs other operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2013 due primarily to higher spend on marketing and promotions we expect marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2014 

other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2012 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base and lower marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue 

general and administrative expenses 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2013 primarily resulted from increased payroll and benefits costs as we grew and increased legal costs partially offset by costs from our biennial all managers’ conference or amc held in the third quarter of 2012 as well as a decrease in 2013 in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to expenses in 2012 related to nonvested stock awards subject to performance conditions we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue in 2014 due primarily to higher estimated noncash stockbased compensation expense of about 100 million given the current stock price and an increase in the number of shares granted and the 2014 amc 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2012 primarily resulted from an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to awards granted in 2012 with a higher stock price on the date of grant and additional expense related to nonvested stock awards subject to performance conditions and costs from our biennial amc 

  

depreciation and amortization 

 

 as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization decreased in 2013 and 2012 as a result of the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base 

income tax provision 

 

 the 2013 effective tax rate decreased by 06 from 2012 due primarily to certain federal tax credits that were extended in 2013 for both 2013 and 2012 which benefited the rate by 11 this decrease was partially offset by nonrecurring adjustments related to state income taxes 

we estimate our 2014 annual effective tax rate will be 392 increasing from 2013 due to the expiration of certain federal credits partially offset by a lower estimated state rate 

the 2012 effective tax rate increased primarily due to expiration of certain federal credits a smaller benefit from food donations and higher foreign losses which we are not yet able to recognize the increase was partially offset by prior period adjustments the 2012 effective tax rate would have been lower by approximately 07 if certain federal credits that were realized in the 2012 tax return after being extended during 2013 had instead been extended during 2012 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2013 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

 

  

 seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and 

  

because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results overall on an annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs we have a cash and shortterm investment balance of 5782 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions including up to 902 million in repurchases under programs authorized as of december 31 2013 to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes we also have a long term investments balance of 3139 million which consists of us treasury notes and certificate of deposit products with maturities of 13 months to approximately 2 years we believe that cash from operations together with our cash balance will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

while operations continue to provide cash our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development our total capital expenditures for 2013 were 1999 million which included the purchase and refurbishment of a corporate aircraft for a total cost of about 83 million we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 235 million in 2014 of which about 175 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments in 2013 for chipotle restaurants in the us we spent on average about 800000 in development and construction costs per restaurant net of landlord reimbursements and for all restaurants including international locations we spent on average about 830000 net of landlord reimbursements for new restaurants to be opened in 2014 we anticipate average development costs will increase approximately 5 due primarily to the mix of locations and categories 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 were as follows 

 

  

   

we’re obligated under noncancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food healthcare costs labor fuel utility costs materials used in the construction of our restaurants and insurance although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs additionally many of our leases require us to pay taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease most of our restaurant locations our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straightline basis over the reasonably assured lease term the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights or sosars which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards and sosars with performancebased vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future 

  

performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different 

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for workers’ compensation general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as 1 million and for property which generally has a 15 million deductible we are selfinsured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2013 were 316 million 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2013 and 2012 although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend commodity price risks 

we are also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices however a majority of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance 

  

changing interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2013 we had 6525 million in investments and interestbearing cash accounts including an insurance related restricted trust account classified in other assets and 2407 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 033 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is limited at this date

 item 1 business tableend general 

chipotle mexican grill inc and its subsidiaries “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operate chipotle mexican grill restaurants which serve a focused menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads made using fresh ingredients as of december 31 2012 we operated 1410 restaurants including chipotle restaurants throughout the united states as well as five in canada five in london england and one in paris france and also one shophouse southeast asian kitchen a restaurant in washington dc serving asianinspired cuisine we focus on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on recruiting and retaining top performing people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is exceptional on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment we have grown substantially over the past five years and expect to open between 165 and 180 additional restaurants in 2013 

our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

we manage our operations and restaurants based on six regions that aggregate into one reportable segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 and our total assets as of december 31 2012 and 2011 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the us 

our menu and food preparation 

food with integrity serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food as part of our food with integrity philosophy we believe that purchasing fresh ingredients and preparing them by hand are not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on the sources of each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food 

in all of our restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones and in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to continue serving meats raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so some of our restaurants served conventionally raised beef for short periods during 2012 and the beginning of 2013 and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

in the past we referred to meat raised in accordance with our criteria as “naturally raised” but we are moving away from that terminology and instead have begun to use the responsibly raised brand to differentiate our meat and other ingredients we think the responsibly raised brand helps to better distinguish our ingredients from other products labeled as “naturally raised” 

  

we’re also investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown or sourced locally while in season by which we mean grown within 350 miles of the restaurant a portion of our beans is organically grown and a portion is sustainably grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown our commitment to food with integrity extends to the dairy products we serve as well the sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh recombinant bovine growth hormone also milk used to make much of our cheese and some of our sour cream is sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows 

we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are responsible farming practices and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area however we believe that in addition to seeking great tasting and nutritious food consumers are increasingly concerned about where their food comes from and how it is raised and we believe that as consumers become more educated about better animal welfare and farming practices as well as social accountability they will foster greater demand for sustainably grown foods in the long term we believe that increased demand over the long term for the types of meat and produce items we strive to serve will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers we also understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if we are able to continue growing while focusing on food with integrity our sourcing flexibility should improve over time though we expect that most of these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than conventionally raised commoditypriced equivalents 

a few things thousands of ways chipotle restaurants serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices we plan to keep a simple menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense and if you can’t find something on the menu that’s quite what you’re after let us know if we can make it from the ingredients we have we’ll do it 

in preparing our food we use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated and grilled in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef and pinto and vegetarian black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt in addition to sodas fruit drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in commissaries 

food served fast … so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that prepared the food and are assembling the order while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a “fastfood” experience even when they’re not in a hurry and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 

  

customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we constantly strive to improve the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic for instance our restaurants accept orders by fax online or through an iphone ordering application in order to provide a more convenient experience by allowing customers to avoid standing in line by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our restaurants we believe that we can provide a high quality experience to more and more customers 

quality assurance and food safety we are committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs for our supply chain our training and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to assure that we comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations 

restaurant management and operations 

culture of top performers in addition to our focus on the food we serve we have a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying hiring and empowering top performing employees we are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our employees and our customers the foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best people in our restaurants we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards yet allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we believe we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower a team of top performers we provide hands on shouldertoshoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees we are committed to developing our people and promoting from within with about 96 of salaried management and almost 99 of hourly management coming from internal promotions our best general managers who run great restaurants and develop strong empowered restaurant teams are promoted to restaurateur and in that role can earn bonuses for developing people we’ve leveraged our outstanding restaurateurs’ leadership by giving many restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring one or more nearby restaurants this provides an opportunity for restaurateurs to develop field leadership roles one restaurant at a time restaurateurs who have shown they can successfully run four restaurants by developing teams of all top performers including at least one restaurateur thereby creating a culture of high standards constant improvement and empowerment in each of their restaurants can be promoted to apprentice team leaders 

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques and microwaves used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats handcut produce and herbs make fresh salsa and guacamole and cook rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a typical fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants 

the front line is key  our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service and our open kitchen design allows customers to see that we prepare our food fresh each and every day all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to interact with customers no matter their job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting 

  

and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer “one burrito at a time” we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among general managers crew members and customers alike 

the basics each restaurant typically has a general manager a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an apprentice manager in about threequarters of our restaurants one or two hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 21 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our general managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes apprentice team leaders team leaders or area managers team directors executive team directors or regional directors and restaurant support officers 

supply chain 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and their understanding of our mission and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with suppliers we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages and we follow industry news trade issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas are purchased from a small number of suppliers 

we generally do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers but have selected and approved suppliers from whom ingredients are purchased for our restaurants distribution centers purchase ingredients and other supplies from suppliers we select and approve based on our quality specifications and purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers 

distribution arrangements ingredients and other supplies are delivered to our restaurants from 23 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers 

marketing 

our marketing has always been based on the belief that the best and most recognizable brands aren’t built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone but rather through all of the ways people experience the brand so we pay close attention to all of these details looking to keep our communications closely aligned with the ways our customers experience chipotle our advertising and promotional programs instore communications and other design elements all help to communicate something about what makes chipotle different from other fast food companies whether it’s engaging with our company via social media participating in our local events or simply eating a burrito at one of our restaurants each interaction with a customer affords us an important opportunity to build our brand 

our advertising has generally included print outdoor transit and radio ads but we are also incorporating online advertising into the mix and adding strategic promotions that demonstrate how chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts or that connect us to likeminded individuals or organizations beyond these traditional means we are exploring new avenues of branded and unbranded content aimed at educating consumers about issues that are important to us and explaining why we are working to drive positive change in the nation’s food 

  

supply in addition we continue to generate considerable media coverage with scores of publications writing favorably about our food restaurant concept and business and our food restaurants and company have been featured in a number of television programs 

we also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture to this end we have been testing more “owned media” including new video and music programs and a more visible event strategy that includes the expansion of our “cultivate” festivals of food music and ideas and participation in relevant events in markets around the country many of these newer programs allow us to tell our story with more nuance than is afforded by traditional advertising and help forge stronger emotional connections with our customers we are also increasing our use of digital mobile and social media to our overall marketing mix giving customers greater opportunity to access chipotle in ways that are convenient for them and broadening our ability to engage with our customers individually through our first ever customer loyalty program the “farm team” we are inviting our most loyal and passionate customers to join a program that educates them about many of the things that make chipotle special and rewards them for expanding and sharing their knowledge of our company 

collectively these efforts and our excellent restaurant teams have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity with our customers learning about us and telling others allowing us to build awareness with relatively low advertising expenditures even in a competitive category and to differentiate chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right things in every facet of our business 

competition 

we compete with national and regional fastcasual quickservice and casual dining restaurants our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains the number size and strength of competitors vary by region market and even restaurant competitors to our restaurants compete based on a number of factors including taste quality speed of service price and value name recognition location menu variety customer service and the ambience and condition of the competitor unlike us a number of our competitors grow through franchising 

we believe we’re wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends including increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared and the increasing prevalence of the fastcasual segment some of our competitors have formats that might resemble ours we believe however that chipotle has become one of the most recognized fastcasual restaurants and that we are known for our focus on preparing food using a variety of fresh ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food as well as our commitment to “food with integrity” which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate 

restaurant site selection 

we believe that site selection is critical to our success and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential location our site selection process includes the use of external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets taking direction from our internal team of real estate managers locations proposed by real estate managers are reviewed on site by a team of development management and often leaders from operations as part of a formal site ride as well as in a written real estate package we study the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and available information on competitors based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as inline or endcap locations in strip or power centers in regional malls and downtown business districts freestanding buildings and even an airport location our new restaurant development activity has broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and restaurants in airports food courts or on military sites 

  

shophouse southeast asian kitchen 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened our first shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 shophouse serves a menu that like at chipotle is focused main dishes consist of rice or noodle bowls made with steak chicken meatballs made with pork and chicken or tofu notwithstanding our opening of shophouse and our plans in 2013 to open another shophouse restaurant in washington dc and to introduce shophouse to the los angeles area our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year 

our intellectual property and trademarks 

“chipotle” “chipotle mexican grill” “unburritable” “food with integrity” “fresh is not enough anymore” “the gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands” “responsibly raised” “shophouse” and a number of related designs and logos are us registered trademarks of chipotle we have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the us in addition to our us registrations we have registered trademarks for “chipotle” and a number of other marks in canada the european union and various other countries and have filed trademark applications for “chipotle mexican grill” “chipotle” and a number of other marks in various countries as well 

we also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress from time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks restaurant designs or advertising although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 

information systems 

chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office this system includes a pointofsales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant additionally the pointofsales system is used to authorize batch and transmit credit card transactions to record employee time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis which enables management to continually monitor operating results we believe that our current pointofsales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion see “risk factors—general business risks— we may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information ” below for a discussion of certain risks associated with our pointofsales systems 

employees

risks related to our growth strategy and future expansion 

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales increases are less than we expect and we may not successfully increase comparable restaurant sales or they may decrease 

while future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants changes in comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases we expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2013 to be flat or low single digit increases due to difficult comparisons and ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty 

our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative a number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases 

beginning in the second quarter of 2012 our comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated which we attribute in part to decreased consumer spending and economic uncertainty and the price of our stock declined significantly in the wake of this deceleration including a decline of nearly 22 on the trading day following our second quarter 2012 earnings release any future deceleration in or failure to meet market expectations for our comparable restaurant sales increases would likely result in another decline in the price of our common stock 

  

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants which is subject to many unpredictable factors 

we operated 1410 restaurants as of december 31 2012 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years and plan to open between 165 and 180 new restaurants in 2013 however we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 one of our biggest challenges in opening new restaurants is staffing we seek to hire only topperforming employees and to promote general managers from our crew which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” 

another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for suitable new restaurant sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors may be exacerbated by any ongoing economic uncertainty as developers may continue to delay or be unable to finance new projects delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline which may in turn slow our sales and profitability growth 

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods similarly our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area higher fixed costs relating to increased labor and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants and a larger 

  

proportion of our recent openings being in higher rent sites than we have historically targeted it may also be difficult for us to attract a customer base if we are not able to staff our restaurants with employees who perform to our high standards if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable we also have lowered the average development cost for new chipotle restaurants in the us significantly in recent years from about 916000 in 2008 to about 800000 in 2012 in the event we are not able to achieve the average development costs we expect for 2013 or sustain the benefits achieved in prior years which could result from inflation project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability additionally our new restaurant development activity has broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience including smaller or more economically mixed communities highway sites outlet centers and restaurants in airports food courts or on military sites the risks relating to building a customer base and managing development and operating costs may be more significant in some or all of these types of trade areas or restaurant sites 

in addition we have now opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market 

our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas 

some of our new restaurants are located in or planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience for instance over the past three years we’ve opened five restaurants in london and one restaurant in paris our first restaurants outside of north america and during 2013 we plan to open an additional restaurant in london an additional restaurant in paris and our first restaurant in germany new markets particularly outside the us may have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as a result new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the chipotle brand and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned due to lower consumer familiarity with the chipotle brand in new markets restaurants opened in these markets particularly outside the us may have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture in addition restaurants in new markets may have higher construction occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets and may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall profitability some or all of these factors may be more pronounced in markets outside the us due to cultural regulatory or economic differences with which we are not familiar which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could thereby adversely impact our overall results our overall results may also be affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar 

shophouse southeast asian kitchen may not contribute to our growth 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which chipotle restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different 

  

ingredients and a different style of food we opened shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 notwithstanding our opening of shophouse and our plans in 2013 to open another shophouse restaurant in washington dc and to introduce shophouse to the los angeles area our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand as a result we do not expect shophouse to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years and we may determine not to move forward with any further expansion of shophouse this might limit our overall growth over the long term 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

as described elsewhere in this report our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain general managers and crew we also are continuing to attempt to improve our field management in an effort to develop additional topperforming general managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results 

risks related to operating in the restaurant industry 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions global demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and soy oil has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice increasing our food costs food prices for a number of our key ingredients escalated markedly at various points during 2012 and we expect that there will be additional pricing pressures on some of those ingredients including beef chicken pork cheese and sour cream during 2013 we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and responsibility criteria or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for commodity food products weather related issues such as freezes or drought may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as produce or meats any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as chicken beef cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our general managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits costs including the requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act discussed further under 

  

“ regulatory and legal risks — governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs—labor and employment regulations ” as well as competition increased minimum wage requirements and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees especially general managers and crew members as we grow we believe we will need to promote or hire additional topperforming field leaders to ensure we hire and motivate good managers and crew and it may be difficult to identify and keep those field leaders our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or erode our employee and restaurant cultures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly 

various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs as well changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees although we require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers this may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees for example following an audit by the department of homeland security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota during 2010 we lost approximately 450 employees resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations including slower throughput as we trained new employees as well as some degree of negative publicity we are currently undergoing a similar audit in virginia and the district of columbia and in april 2011 we received notice from the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia that it is conducting an investigation into these matters through its criminal division see note 9 “commitments and contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” termination of a significant number of employees in those or other markets or across our company would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees our financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors 

because we do not franchise risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring payment and termination of employees and employeerelated litigation may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees 

instances of foodborne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants or result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales and could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat produce or dairy we use to prepare our food 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors subject us to liability to affected customers and could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry that adversely affects our sales for instance on a small number of occasions a chipotle restaurant has been associated with customer illness and on those occasions our sales have been adversely impacted at times even in markets beyond those impacted by the illness the risk of illnesses associated with our food might increase in connection with an expansion of our catering business or other situations in which our food is served in conditions we cannot control if our customers become ill from foodborne or localized illnesses or attribute an illness to our food we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants would adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability 

  

in addition reports linking nationwide or regional outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu similarly past outbreaks of e coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems other foodborne illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse affect on the price and availability of affected ingredients if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains many of our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry for example competitive pressures can come from deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things a more diverse menu lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations we have almost no longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on the same third party distribution network as mcdonald’s corporation from which we separated in 2006 if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream cheese and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive 

  

from our food with integrity suppliers and as described in more detail above these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels negative consumer sentiment has been reported to be impacting the economy to various degrees since the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 and according to some forecasts will continue to do so during 2013 our average restaurant sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty which can be caused by various factors such as high unemployment increasing taxes or other changes in fiscal or monetary policy high gasoline prices declining home prices tight credit markets or foreign political or economic unrest any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

if we were to experience widespread difficulty renewing existing leases on favorable terms our revenue or occupancy costs could be adversely affected 

we lease substantially all of the properties on which we operate restaurants and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value which could involve substantial increases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals could adversely impact us if we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs reducing our restaurant margins 

regulatory and legal risks 

governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs 

employment and immigration regulations 

we are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules and antidiscrimination laws complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for noncompliance for example a number of lawsuits have been 

  

filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime meal and rest breaks employee recordkeeping and related practices with respect to our employees we could suffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend these or similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant in addition several states in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases and these increases could increase our labor costs 

we also are audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well and recent audit activity and federal criminal and civil investigations in this area are described in more detail above under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees on the other hand in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants we could be found to be in violation of antidiscrimination laws we could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance antidiscrimination compliance or both that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees moreover in addition to the criminal and civil investigations mentioned above under “risks related to operating in the restaurant industry— our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia and the us securities and exchange commission have informed us that they are conducting parallel investigations into possible criminal and civil securities law violations relating to our employee work authorization compliance and related disclosures and statements as well all of the foregoing investigations will continue to be expensive and distracting and could subject us to fines reputational damage and other liabilities that could be significant 

the comprehensive us health care reform law enacted in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage we are evaluating the impact the new law will have on us and although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have we expect that the requirement that we provide more extensive health benefits to employees than we currently do could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the restaurant industry in general the most significant increase in costs will likely begin in 2014 such increases will likely be large enough to materially impact our labor costs alternatively if we choose not to provide the required health insurance or if some employees do not qualify for the required insurance our employee culture may be harmed and we may face adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand 

additionally while we do not currently have any unionized employees union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant companies if a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired potential changes in labor laws including the possible passage of all or parts of the proposed employee free choice act could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture 

americans with disabilities act and similar state laws 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act or ada and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we have incurred substantial legal fees in connection with adarelated complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws the expenses associated with these modifications or any damages legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ada or similar state laws could be material 

  

nutrition and food regulation 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and a number of other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available the us health care reform law included nationwide menu labeling and nutrition disclosure requirements as well and our restaurants will be covered by these national requirements when they go into effect which may be as early as 2013 initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales 

local licensure zoning and other regulation 

each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

environmental laws 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

other aspects of regulatory risk 

from time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various laws and regulations that cover our business the majority of this litigation occurs in california even though currently only about 17 of our restaurants are located there as we continue to expand in california or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in california our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in or minimized our operations in california 

because we do not franchise the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business as described above may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

we’re subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters including wages work hours overtime vacation and family leave discrimination wrongful termination and similar matters and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related 

  

to these or different matters in the future our customers also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we’re responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices see “ governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs ” above for additional discussion of these types of claims from time to time we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties we believe the number of all of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers particularly in california we are also undergoing government investigations as described elsewhere in this report including under “ risks related to operating in the restaurant industry — our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders ” regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we’re ultimately held liable for such claims they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects which in turn could adversely affect our results 

risks related to our unique business strategy 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice restaurant segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create consumers may also be more pricesensitive during periods of economic difficulty or uncertainty and we experienced some decrease in traffic during late 2008 and throughout 2009 that we attribute in part to menu price increases recent reports have indicated continued consumer uncertainty that may persist during 2013 so our ability to increase sales may be significantly hampered for the foreseeable future if we do elect to increase menu prices it may adversely impact our customer traffic 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

the principle of food with integrity constitutes a significant part of our business strategy we use a substantial amount of ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on practices we believe to be more sustainable or responsible than some conventional practices and try to make food as fresh as we can we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality sustainability and other responsible practices growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat dairy and produce ingredients given the costs associated with what we believe are more responsible farming practices and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area although all of our restaurants generally serve meat from animals raised in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare we may experience shortages of meat particularly chicken or steak meeting these criteria due to suppliers suspending production market conditions or other forces beyond our control a few of our markets have reverted to temporarily serving conventionally raised beef or chicken due to supply shortages including for brief periods on a regional basis during 2012 and early 2013 furthermore as we grow the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained moreover we have 

  

made a significant commitment to serving local or organic produce when seasonally available and a small portion of our restaurants also serves produce purchased from farmers markets seasonally as well these produce initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent and present additional risk of foodborne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty of imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers quality variations and foodborne illness concerns could adversely impact public perceptions of food with integrity or our brand generally 

if as a result of any of these factors we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with food with integrity which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline our commitment to food with integrity may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our food with integrity approach any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants we may also face adverse publicity or liability for false advertising claims if suppliers without our knowledge do not adhere to all of the elements of our food with integrity programs such as responsible meat protocols requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions if any such supplier failures are publicized our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted 

additionally in response to increasing customer awareness and demand some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones dairy products from cows not treated with rbgh and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our food with integrity philosophy if competitors become known for using these types of higherquality or more sustainable ingredients it could further limit our supply of these ingredients and may make it more difficult for us to differentiate chipotle and our restaurants which could adversely impact our operating results 

our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

our chairman and cochief executive officer steve ells founded our company has been the principal architect of our business strategy and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 1400 restaurants today monty moran our cochief executive officer and jack hartung our chief financial officer have also served with us for several years and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well we believe our executive officers have created an employee culture food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team we also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision if our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership or a new management team were to change or be unsuccessful in implementing our strategy our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted 

our marketing and advertising strategies may not be successful which could adversely impact our business 

we have developed a marketing and advertising strategy that we believe is unique in the restaurant industry we have not generally advertised on television and engage in very limited price or valuebased promotions instead we invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will increase customers’ connection with our brand if these marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant sales the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect in addition our marketing has increasingly incorporated elements intended to encourage customers to question sources or production methods commonly used to produce food these elements of our marketing could alienate food suppliers and may potentially lead to an increased risk of disputes or litigation if suppliers or other constituencies believe our marketing is unfair or misleading increased costs in connection with any such issues or any deterioration in our relationships with existing suppliers could adversely impact us 

  

general business risks 

we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2012 approximately 62 of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers including us have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen in august 2004 the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data as a result we recorded losses and related expenses totaling 43 million from 2004 through 2006 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

we also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees the collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding if the security and information systems of ours or of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties which could adversely affect our financial performance our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability property damage and auto liability we are selfinsured for our health plans and have purchased a fullyinsured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability property damage and auto liability insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we estimated or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos our food with integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have 

  

a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading days—that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall we believe the market price of our common stock which has generally traded at a higher priceearnings ratio than stocks of most or all of our peer companies reflects high market expectations for our future operating results as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

  

restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from mcdonald’s could adversely affect us 

mcdonald’s corporation was our majority owner from 2000 until october 2006 we understand that the exchange offer mcdonald’s completed in october 2006 to dispose of its interest in us was generally taxfree to mcdonald’s and its shareholders in order to protect the taxfree status of the exchange offer in the separation agreement we entered into with mcdonald’s in connection with the separation we agreed among other things to indemnify mcdonald’s for taxes and related losses it incurs as a result of the exchange failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction in certain situations if the taxes and related losses are attributable to i certain direct or indirect acquisitions of our stock or assets regardless of whether we consent to such acquisitions ii negotiations understandings agreements or arrangements in respect of such acquisitions or iii any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that affects the relative voting rights of any separate classes of our common stock in december 2009 following completion of an extensive due diligence process we completed a share conversion eliminating the existence of our class b common stock and with it the superior voting rights of the class b common stock in the event the share conversion is deemed to result in the mcdonald’s exchange offer failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction we may have an indemnification obligation under the provision described above we currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s could exceed 450 million and this estimate does not take into account related losses and depends upon several factors that are beyond our control as a consequence the indemnity to mcdonald’s could vary substantially from the estimate and may be much greater 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with mcdonald’s described above under “ restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from mcdonald’s could adversely affect us ” may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

overview 

chipotle operates fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining through our vision of food with integrity chipotle is seeking better food from using ingredients that are not only fresh but that where possible are sustainably and responsibly grown and raised with respect to the animals the land and the farmers who produce the food a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees enables us to develop future leaders from within 

2012 highlights and trends 

restaurant development  as of december 31 2012 we had 1410 restaurants of which 1399 were located throughout the united states five were located in canada five were located in london england and one was located in paris france our restaurants include one shophouse southeast asian kitchen a restaurant serving asianinspired cuisine new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth and we opened 183 restaurants in 2012 and expect to open between 165 and 180 restaurants in 2013 including any new shophouse restaurants 

sales growth  average restaurant sales were 2113 million as of december 31 2012 increasing from 2013 million as of december 31 2011 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months our comparable restaurant sales increases were 71 in 2012 comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation comparable restaurant sales increases in 2012 were driven primarily by an increase in customer visits as well as the impact of menu price increases we implemented menu price increases in our pacific region during the first quarter of both 2012 and 2011 and in our remaining regions during the summer of 2011 and as a result menu price increases benefitted comparable restaurant sales by 28 in 2012 taking into account the loss of the benefit of menu price increases and our recent transaction trends as well as ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty we expect 2013 comparable restaurant sales to be flat or low single digit increases assuming we do not increase menu prices 

food with integrity in all of our restaurants we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones and in accordance with criteria we’ve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare in addition a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown or sourced locally when in season by which we mean within 350 miles of our restaurant and a portion of the beans we serve is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which they are grown the sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh milk used to make much of our cheese and some of our sour cream is sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows we will continue to search for quality ingredients that not only taste delicious but also benefit local farmers or the environment or otherwise benefit or improve the sustainability of our supply chain 

  

one of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to continue serving meats that are raised to meet our standards but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so some of our restaurants served conventionally raised beef for short periods during 2012 and the beginning of 2013 and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints when we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so 

our food costs increased in 2012 as a result of inflationary pressures on many of our ingredients particularly beef chicken and rice and initiatives to improve the taste and quality of our food the increase was partially offset by the impact of menu price increases and relief in avocado prices we expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2013 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase if food inflation continues to pressure food costs we may after taking into account the general economic environment consumer confidence and our sales trends raise menu prices later in 2013 

stock repurchases in accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors we purchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of 2064 million during 2012 as of december 31 2012 1002 million was available to be repurchased under the current repurchase authorizations which were announced on october 18 2012 and november 20 2012 on february 5 2013 we announced that our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to an additional 100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b51c authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time subject to market conditions the existing repurchase agreement and the board’s authorization of the repurchases may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

on november 20 2012 we also entered into a privately negotiated accelerated share repurchase transaction “asr” to repurchase 25 million of our common stock the 25 million is part of the 100 million repurchase program announced on november 20 2012 we advanced the 25 million upon commencement of the transaction and received 65187 shares which represented 70 of the total number of shares to be repurchased calculated using the closing price on the commencement date the final number of shares to be repurchased under the asr will be determined based generally on the volumeweighted average share price of our common stock over a specified period the asr will be completed during the first quarter of 2013 

restaurant openings relocations and closures 

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 

 

 results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as our business grows as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase 

  

revenue 

 

 the significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to 3047 million of the increase in sales in 2012 of which 1348 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year in 2011 restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to 2379 million of the increase in sales of which 928 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2011 

comparable restaurant sales increases contributed 1564 million and 1956 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2012 and 2011 respectively comparable restaurant sales growth in 2012 and 2011 was due primarily to increases in customer visits as well as the impact of menu price increases 

food beverage and packaging costs 

 

 food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2012 due to inflation on many food items primarily beef chicken and rice and initiatives to improve the taste and quality of our food the increase was partially offset by the impact of menu price increases and relief in avocado prices we expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2013 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase 

food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 due to inflation on most food items including avocados beef chicken and dairy partially offset by the impact of menu price increases 

labor costs 

 

 labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2012 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales including the impact of menu price increases partially offset by increased average wage rates 

  

labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2011 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales including the impact of menu price increases partially offset by increased average wage rates as well as labor inefficiencies 

occupancy costs 

 

 occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2012 and in 2011 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

other operating costs 

 

 other operating costs include among other items marketing and promotional costs bank and credit card fees and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2012 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base and lower marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue we expect marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2013 

other operating costs remained consistent as a percentage of revenue in 2011 the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base and lower marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue was offset by increased credit card fees resulting from a higher percentage of customers using credit cards as well as increased maintenance of restaurants as they age and general inflationary pressures 

general and administrative expenses 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2012 primarily resulted from an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to awards granted in 2012 with a higher stock price on the date of grant and additional expense related to nonvested stock awards subject to performance conditions and costs from our biennial all managers’ conference which we held during the year 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2011 primarily resulted from an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to awards granted in 2011 with a significantly higher stock price on the date of grant as well as hiring more employees as we grew these increases were partially offset by costs from the biennial all managers’ conference held during the third quarter of 2010 

  

depreciation and amortization 

 

 as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization decreased in 2012 and 2011 as a result of the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

income tax provision 

 

 the 2012 effective tax rate increased from 2011 primarily due to expiration of certain federal credits a smaller benefit from food donations and higher foreign losses which we are not yet able to recognize the increase was partially offset by prior period adjustments the 2012 effective tax rate would have been lower by approximately 05 if certain federal credits that will be realized in the 2012 tax return had been recognized because these credits were authorized by congress in january 2013 the benefit of the credits will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013 we estimate our 2013 annual effective tax rate will be 385 including 05 estimated benefit related to the 2012 reinstated federal tax benefits 

the 2011 effective tax rate increased primarily due to an increase in the state rate smaller benefit from food donations and onetime adjustments partially offset by the onetime employment tax credits 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2012 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

 

  

 seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of 

  

mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results overall on an annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs we have a cash and shortterm investment balance of 4729 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions including up to 1002 million in repurchases under programs authorized as of december 31 2012 to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes we also have a long term investments balance of 1909 million which consists of us treasury notes and certificate of deposit products with maturities of 13 months to approximately 2 years we believe that cash from operations together with our cash balance will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

while operations continue to provide cash our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development our total capital expenditures for 2012 were 1970 million and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 210 million in 2013 of which 160 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments in 2012 for chipotle restaurants in the us we spent on average about 800000 in development and construction costs per restaurant net of landlord reimbursements and about 820000 net of landlord reimbursements for all restaurants including international locations for new restaurants to be opened in 2013 we anticipate average development costs will be similar to 2012 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 were as follows 

 

  

   

we’re obligated under noncancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food healthcare costs labor fuel utility costs materials used in the construction of our restaurants and insurance although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs additionally many of our leases require us to pay taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease most of our restaurant locations our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights or sosars which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards and sosars with performancebased vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different

we maintain various insurance policies for workers’ compensation general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as 1 million and for property which generally has a 15 million deductible we are self insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2012 were 278 million 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2012 and 2011 although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability as a result in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend changing interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2012 we had 4708 million in investments and interestbearing cash accounts including an insurance related restricted trust account classified in other assets and 1994 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 033 

commodity price risks 

we are also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices however a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase or if menu price increases result in customer resistance 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is limited at this date

 item 1 business tableend general 

chipotle mexican grill inc and its subsidiaries “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operate restaurants throughout the united states as well as two restaurants in toronto canada and two in london england as of december 31 2011 we operated 1230 restaurants which includes one shophouse southeast asian kitchen chipotle restaurants serve a focused menu of burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads made using fresh ingredients we focus on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on recruiting and retaining top performing people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is exceptional on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment we have grown substantially over the past five years and expect to open between 155 and 165 additional restaurants in 2012 

our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

we manage our operations and restaurants based on six regions that aggregate into one reportable segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 and our total assets as of december 31 2011 and 2010 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the us 

our menu and food preparation 

food with integrity serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food as part of our food with integrity philosophy we believe that using fresh ingredients is not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on where we obtain each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food as of december 31 2011 we were serving exclusively naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants in the us continuing to serve naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants is one of our goals but as discussed below we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so some of our restaurants served conventionally raised chicken or steak for much of 2011 a few markets reverted to conventionally raised beef in early 2012 and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints we define naturally raised as coming from animals that are never given antibiotics or added hormones and that are raised responsibly—that is in accordance with our animal welfare standards 

we’re also investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown or sourced locally while in season by which we mean grown within 350 miles of the restaurant a portion of our beans is organically grown and a portion is sustainably grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown our food with integrity commitment extends to the dairy products we serve as well all of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh recombinant bovine growth hormone also milk used to make much of our cheese and a portion of our sour cream is sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing pasture access for their cows 

  

we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity for example current economic conditions have led to naturally raised chicken and steak supply shortages it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria and there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones organic and sustainable crops can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower for organically or sustainably grown produce given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area however we believe that in addition to seeking great tasting and nutritious food consumers are increasingly concerned about where their food comes from and how it is raised and we believe that as consumers become more educated about better animal welfare and farming practices as well as social accountability they will foster greater demand for sustainably grown foods in the longterm we believe that increased demand for naturally raised meat and produce over the longterm will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers we also understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if we are able to continue growing while focusing on food with integrity our sourcing flexibility should improve over time though we expect that most of these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than conventionally raised commoditypriced equivalents 

a few things thousands of ways chipotle restaurants serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices we plan to keep a simple menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense and if you can’t find something on the menu that’s quite what you’re after let us know if we can make it from the ingredients we have we’ll do it 

in preparing our food we use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated and grilled in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef and pinto and vegetarian black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt in addition to sodas fruit drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in commissaries 

food served fast … so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that prepared the food and are assembling the order while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a “fastfood” experience even when they’re not in a hurry and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we’re focused on further improving the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic for instance our restaurants accept orders by fax online or through an iphone ordering application in order to provide a more convenient experience by allowing customers to avoid standing in line by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our restaurants we believe that we can provide a high quality experience to more and more customers 

  

quality assurance and food safety we are committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs for our supply chain our training and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to assure that we comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations 

restaurant management and operations 

culture of top performers in addition to the focus on our food we have a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying hiring and empowering top performing employees we are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our employees and our customers the foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best people in our restaurants we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards yet allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we believe we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower others we provide hands on shouldertoshoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees we are committed to developing our people and promoting from within with almost 98 of salaried management and more than 98 of hourly management coming from internal promotions our best restaurant managers who run great restaurants and develop strong empowered restaurant teams are promoted to restaurateur and in that role can earn bonuses for developing people we’ve leveraged our outstanding restaurateurs’ leadership by giving select restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring one or more nearby restaurants this provides an opportunity for restaurateurs to develop field leadership roles one restaurant at a time restaurateurs who have shown they can successfully run four restaurants by developing teams of all top performers including at least one restaurateur thereby creating a culture of high standards constant improvement and empowerment in each of their restaurants can be promoted to apprentice team leaders 

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques and microwaves used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats handcut produce and herbs make fresh salsa and guacamole and cook rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a typical fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants 

the front line is key our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service and our open kitchen design allows customers to see that we prepare our food fresh each and every day all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to interact with customers no matter their job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer “one burrito at a time” we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among restaurant managers crew members and customers alike 

the basics each restaurant typically has a restaurant manager a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an apprentice manager in about threequarters of our restaurants one or two hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 20 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people the 

  

opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our restaurant managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes apprentice team leaders team leaders or area managers team directors and regional directors 

supply chain 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire highquality fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers our distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and their understanding of our mission and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with suppliers we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages and we follow industry news trade issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices certain key ingredients beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream and tortillas are purchased from a small number of suppliers 

we generally do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers but have selected and approved all of the suppliers from whom ingredients are purchased for our restaurants distribution centers purchase ingredients and other supplies from suppliers we select and approve based on our quality specifications and purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers 

distribution arrangements we deliver ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants from 22 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers as we continue to expand geographically we expect to add additional regional distribution centers 

marketing 

our marketing has always been based on the belief that the best and most recognizable brands aren’t built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone but rather through all of the ways people experience the brand so we pay close attention to all of these details looking to keep our communications closely aligned with the ways our customers experience chipotle our advertising and promotional programs instore communications and other design elements such as menus and signs all say something about who we are and we believe it’s important that we present our brand consistently in our communications and the experience our customers enjoy that has always been a hallmark of our marketing and we are constantly looking to do these things better 

when we open restaurants in new markets we plan a range of activities to introduce chipotle to the local community and to create interest in the restaurant from the start in existing markets our restaurants generally open strong with volumes at or near market averages even with little promotion surrounding the opening our advertising has generally included print outdoor transit and radio ads but we are also incorporating online advertising into the mix and adding strategic promotions that demonstrate how chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts or that connect us to likeminded individuals or organizations in addition we continue to generate considerable media coverage with scores of publications writing favorably about our food restaurant concept and business and our food restaurants and company have been featured in a number of television programs 

we also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture to this end we have been testing more “owned media” including new video and music programs and a more visible event strategy that includes the launch of our first festival of food music and ideas “cultivate chicago” and participation in relevant events in markets around the country many of these newer programs allow us to tell our story with more nuance than is afforded by traditional advertising and help forge stronger emotional connections with our customers we are also increasing our use of digital mobile and social 

  

media to our overall marketing mix giving customers greater opportunity to access chipotle in ways that are convenient for them and broadening our ability to engage with our customers individually through our first ever customer loyalty program the “farm team” we are inviting our most loyal and passionate customers to join a program that educates them about many of the things that make chipotle special and rewarding them for expanding and sharing their knowledge of our company 

collectively these efforts and our excellent restaurant teams have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity with our customers learning about us and telling others allowing us to build awareness with relatively low advertising expenditures even in a competitive category and to differentiate chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right things in every facet of our business 

competition 

we compete with national and regional fastcasual quickservice and casual dining restaurants our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains the number size and strength of competitors vary by region market and even restaurant competitors to our restaurants compete based on a number of factors including taste quality speed of service price and value name recognition location customer service and the ambience and condition of the competitor unlike us a number of our competitors grow through franchising 

we believe we’re wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends including increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared and the increasing prevalence of the fastcasual segment some of our competitors have formats that might resemble ours we believe however that chipotle has become one of the most recognized fastcasual restaurants and that we are known for our focus on preparing food using a variety of fresh ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food as well as our commitment to “food with integrity” which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate 

restaurant site selection 

we believe that site selection is critical to our success and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential location our site selection process includes the use of external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets taking direction from our internal team of real estate managers locations proposed by real estate managers are reviewed on site by a team of operations and development management as part of a formal site ride as well as in a written real estate package we study the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and available information on competitors based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as inline or endcap locations in strip or power centers regional malls downtown business districts freestanding buildings and even an airport location 

shophouse test concept 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 shophouse serves a menu that like at chipotle is focused main dishes consist of rice or noodle bowls or banh mi sandwiches made with steak chicken meatballs made with pork and chicken or tofu 

notwithstanding our opening of shophouse southeast asian kitchen and our plans to open one additional shophouse restaurant during 2012 our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand 

  

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year 

our intellectual property and trademarks 

“chipotle” “chipotle mexican grill” “unburritable” “food with integrity” “fresh is not enough anymore” “the gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands” “shophouse” and a number of related designs and logos are us registered trademarks of chipotle we have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the us in addition to our us registrations we have registered trademarks for “chipotle” and a number of other marks in canada the european union and various other countries and have filed trademark applications for “chipotle mexican grill” “chipotle” and a number of other marks in various countries as well 

we also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress from time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks restaurant designs or advertising although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 

information systems 

chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office this system includes a pointofsales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant additionally the pointofsales system is used to authorize batch and transmit credit card transactions to record employee time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis which enables management to continually monitor operating results we believe that our current pointofsales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion see “risk factors— we may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information ” below for a discussion of certain risks associated with our pointofsales systems 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had about 30940 employees including about 2570 salaried employees and about 28370 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants which is subject to many unpredictable factors 

we operated 1230 restaurants as of december 31 2011 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years and plan to open between 155 and 165 new restaurants in 2012 however we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 one of our biggest challenges is staffing new restaurants we seek to hire only topperforming employees and to promote restaurant managers from our crew which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under “ our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants ” 

another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for those sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors may be exacerbated by any ongoing tightness in credit markets as developers may continue to delay or be unable to finance new projects delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline which may in turn slow our sales and profitability growth 

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods similarly our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits we expect that our new restaurant openings in 2012 will be weighted more heavily to the second half of the year though more evenly dispersed through the year than in 2011 the weighting of openings to the second half of 2012 may adversely affect our revenue growth during the first half of the year and our profitability in the second half 

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales increases are less than we expect and we may not successfully increase comparable restaurant sales 

while future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants changes in comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the higher profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases we expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2012 to be in the mid single digits due to difficult comparisons with 2011 and ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty 

our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 a number of these factors are beyond our control as a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative if this were to happen sales and profit growth would be adversely affected and our stock price would be likely to decline 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area higher fixed costs relating to increased labor and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants and a larger proportion of our recent openings being in higher rent sites than we have historically targeted it may also be difficult for us to attract a customer base if we are not able to staff our restaurants with employees who perform to our high standards if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable we also have lowered the average development cost of our new restaurants significantly in recent years from about 916000 in 2008 to about 800000 in 2011 and expect development costs in 2012 to be similar to 2011 in the event we are not able to achieve the average development costs we expect for 2012 or sustain the benefits achieved in prior years which could result from inflation project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability 

in addition we have now opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions global demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and soy oil has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice increasing our food costs food prices for a number of our key ingredients escalated markedly during 2011 and we expect that there will be additional pricing pressures on some of those ingredients including beef chicken rice and beans during 2012 we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to naturally raised meats or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for commodity food products weather related issues such as freezes or drought may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of 

  

some ingredients such as produce or meats any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as beef chicken cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like competition increased minimum wage requirements employee benefits and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees especially restaurant managers and crew members our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or require us to change our culture any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly 

various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs as well some of these changes may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees although we require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers this may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees for example following an audit by the department of homeland security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota during 2010 we lost approximately 450 employees resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations including slower throughput as we trained new employees as well as some degree of negative publicity we are currently undergoing a similar audit in virginia and the district of columbia and in april 2011 we received notice from the office of the united states attorney for the district of columbia that it is conducting an investigation into these matters through its criminal division termination of a significant number of employees in those or other markets or across our company will disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and may also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees our financial performance could be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors 

because we do not franchise risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring payment and termination of employees and employeerelated litigation may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees 

instances of foodborne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants or result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales and could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat produce or dairy we use to prepare our food 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry which could adversely affect sales for instance on a small number of occasions a chipotle restaurant has been associated with customer illness and on those occasions our sales have been adversely impacted at times even in markets beyond those impacted by the illness if our customers become ill from foodborne or localized illnesses we could be forced to temporarily 

  

close some restaurants a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants would adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability 

in addition reports linking a nationwide outbreak of salmonella during the summer of 2008 to a variety of fresh produce items caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu similarly past outbreaks of e coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems other foodborne illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse affect on the price and availability of affected ingredients if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create consumers may also be more pricesensitive during difficult economic times and we experienced some decrease in traffic during late 2008 and throughout 2009 that we attribute in part to menu price increases recent reports have indicated continued consumer uncertainty that may persist during 2012 so our ability to increase sales may be significantly hampered for the foreseeable future if we do elect to increase menu prices it may adversely impact our customer traffic 

governmental regulation may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants 

we are subject to various federal state and local regulations for example we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act or ada and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws the expenses associated with these modifications or any damages legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ada or similar state laws could be material during 2010 an appeals court in california found that the design we formerly used for our serving line had violated the ada and although we are continuing to defend that case in the event we are not successful in our defense losses in that case and related class actions may exceed our accruals and could have a material impact on us 

we are also subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules and antidiscrimination laws complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for noncompliance for example a lawsuit has been filed against us in california alleging violations of state laws regarding employee recordkeeping meal and rest breaks payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees we could suffer losses in this case or similar cases and any such losses could be significant in addition several states in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases and these increases could 

  

increase our labor costs we also are audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well and recent audit activity in this area is described in more detail above under “ our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants ” unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees we could also experience adverse publicity arising from immigrationrelated enforcement activity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees 

from time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various of the laws and regulations that cover our business the majority of this litigation occurs in california even though currently only about 16 of our restaurants are located there as we continue to expand in california or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in california our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in or minimized our operations in california 

a comprehensive us health care reform law was enacted in 2010 we are evaluating the impact the new law will have on our employees although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have on us we expect that our expenses will significantly increase over the long term as a result of the law particularly in 2014 under the current version of the law and any such increases will likely be large enough to materially impact our results of operations 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and a number of other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available the us health care reform law included nationwide menu labeling and nutrition disclosure requirements as well and our restaurants are covered by these national requirements initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales 

each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

  

because we do not franchise the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business as described above may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees 

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover new companies may enter our markets and target our customers for example additional competitive pressures have come more recently from the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to adhere to the principle of food with integrity we use a substantial amount of naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients and try to make our food as fresh as we can in light of pricing considerations we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria and there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones organic and sustainable crops can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower for organically or sustainably grown produce given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area although as of december 31 2011 we served naturally raised meat in all of our restaurants in the us we may experience shortages particularly of naturally raised chicken or steak due to suppliers suspending production market conditions or other forces beyond our control a few of our markets reverted to serving conventionally raised beef in early 2012 due to supply shortages furthermore as we grow the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained moreover we are broadening our commitment to serving local or organic produce and produce purchased from farmers markets when seasonally available these initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent and present additional risk of foodborne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers 

  

quality variations and foodborne illness concerns could adversely impact public perceptions of food with integrity or our brand generally 

if as a result of any of these factors we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis or at all our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with food with integrity which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline our commitment to food with integrity may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our food with integrity approach any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants we may also face adverse publicity if suppliers without our knowledge do not adhere to all of the elements of our food with integrity programs such as naturally raised meat protocols requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions if any such supplier failures are publicized our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted 

additionally in response to increasing customer awareness and demand some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones dairy products from cows not treated with rbgh and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our food with integrity philosophy if competitors become known for using these types of higherquality or more sustainable ingredients it may make it more difficult for us to differentiate chipotle and our restaurants which could adversely impact our operating results 

our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas 

some of our new restaurants are located in or planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience for instance over the past two years we’ve opened two restaurants in london our first restaurants outside of north america and we plan to open a restaurant in paris in 2012 new markets particularly outside the united states may have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as a result new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the chipotle brand and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture restaurants opened in new markets particularly outside the united states may also have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher construction occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets we may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall profitability some or all of these factors may be more pronounced in markets outside the united states due to cultural regulatory or economic differences with which we are not familiar which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could thereby adversely impact our overall results our overall results may also be affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar 

shophouse southeast asian kitchen may not contribute to our growth 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which chipotle restaurants are based—finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience—can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we opened shophouse southeast asian kitchen during 2011 notwithstanding our opening of shophouse and our plans to open one additional shophouse restaurant during 

  

2012 our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand as a result we do not expect shophouse to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years and we may determine not to move forward with the expansion of shophouse at all this might limit our overall growth over the long term 

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase significantly during 2012 

stock compensation awards are an important element of our compensation programs accounting rules require that we record noncash stockbased compensation expense in connection with any stock compensation awards with the expense recorded for stockonly stock appreciation rights or sosars determined by valuing the awards based on a number of accepted valuation methodologies as a result of the significant increase in the price of our common stock the computed value of sosar awards and the associated noncash stockbased compensation expense to be recorded has increased significantly in recent years noncash stock based compensation expense totaled approximately 43 million in 2011 and we expect that amount to increase by at least 50 percent for 2012 based on the higher stock price used to compute the value of sosars awarded during 2012 as well as the potential for additional expense associated with performance shares if they are determined to be probable to vest at a higher level this significant increase will adversely impact our general and administrative expense for 2012 our general and administrative expense for 2012 will also be impacted by up to 50 million in expenses associated with our biennial all managers conference which we will hold during the third quarter of 2012 these increases in general and administrative expense will adversely impact our operating income and earnings per share during 2012 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

we’re subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters discrimination and similar matters and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future our customers also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we’re responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices see “ governmental regulation may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants ” above for a description of particular claims of this type from time to time we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties we believe the number of all of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we’re ultimately held liable claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects which in turn could adversely affect our results 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations we have almost no longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on the same third party distribution network as mcdonald’s corporation if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our food with integrity 

  

suppliers and as described in more detail above these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels negative consumer sentiment in the wake of the economic downturn has been widely reported over the past three years and according to some forecasts will continue during 2012 our sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty which can be caused by various factors such as high gasoline prices high unemployment declining home prices tight credit markets or foreign political or economic unrest any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain restaurant managers and crew we also are continuing to revise our field management structure in an effort to develop additional topperforming restaurant managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability and property damage we are selfinsured for our health plans and have purchased a fullyinsured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability and property damage insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on 

  

historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

our chairman and cochief executive officer steve ells founded our company has been the principal architect of our business strategy and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 1200 restaurants today monty moran our cochief executive officer and jack hartung our chief financial officer have also served with us for several years and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well we believe our executive officers have created an employee culture food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team we also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision if our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership or a new management team were to change or be unsuccessful in implementing our strategy our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted 

we may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2011 approximately 60 of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers including us have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen in august 2004 the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data as a result we recorded losses and related expenses totaling 43 million from 2004 through 2006 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos our food with integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

  

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading days that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall we believe the market price of our common stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results and as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from mcdonald’s could adversely affect us 

mcdonald’s corporation was our majority owner from 2000 until october 2006 we understand that the exchange offer mcdonald’s completed in october 2006 to dispose of its interest in us was generally taxfree to mcdonald’s and its shareholders in order to protect the taxfree status of the exchange offer in the separation agreement we entered into with mcdonald’s in connection with the separation we agreed among other things to indemnify mcdonald’s for taxes and related losses it incurs as a result of the exchange failing to qualify as a 

  

taxfree transaction in certain situations if the taxes and related losses are attributable to i certain direct or indirect acquisitions of our stock or assets regardless of whether we consent to such acquisitions ii negotiations understandings agreements or arrangements in respect of such acquisitions or iii any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that affects the relative voting rights of any separate classes of our common stock in december 2009 following completion of an extensive due diligence process we completed a share conversion eliminating the existence of our class b common stock and with it the superior voting rights of the class b common stock in the event the share conversion is deemed to result in the mcdonald’s exchange offer failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction we may have an indemnification obligation under the provision described above we currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s could exceed 450 million and this estimate does not take into account related losses and depends upon several factors that are beyond our control as a consequence the indemnity to mcdonald’s could vary substantially from the estimate and may be much greater 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with mcdonald’s described above under “ restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from mcdonald’s could adversely affect us ” may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend california ada cases 

in 2006 maurizio antoninetti filed suit against us in the us district court for the southern district of california primarily claiming that the height of the serving line wall in our restaurants violated the americans with disabilities act or ada as well as california disability laws on december 6 2006 mr antoninetti filed an additional lawsuit in the same court making the same allegations on a class action basis on behalf of himself and a purported class of disabled individuals and a similar class action was filed by james perkins in us district court for the central district of california on may 7 2008 

in the individual antoninetti action the district court entered a ruling in which it found that although our counter height violated the ada we provided the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation and awarded attorney’s fees and minimal damages to the plaintiff which we have accrued we and the plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit and on july 26 2010 the appeals court entered a ruling finding that we violated the ada and did not provide the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation and remanded the case to the district court the district court will now determine the damages and injunctive relief and final award of attorneys fees to which antoninetti is entitled based on the court of appeals ruling 

we lowered the height of our serving line walls throughout california some time ago which makes injunctive relief in both the individual and class actions moot and have the lower serving line walls in a significant majority of our restaurants outside of california as well we will vigorously defend the class action cases including by contesting certification of a plaintiff class it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any additional potential liability from these cases 

notices of inspection of work authorization documents 

following an inspection during 2010 by the us department of homeland security or dhs of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota the immigration and customs enforcement arm of dhs or ice issued to us a notice of suspect documents identifying a large number of employees who according to ice and notwithstanding our review of work authorization documents for each employee at the time they were hired appeared not to be authorized to work in the us we approached each of the named employees to explain ice’s determination and afforded each employee an opportunity to confirm the validity of their original work eligibility documents or provide valid work eligibility documents employees who were unable to provide valid work eligibility documents were terminated in accordance with the law in december 2010 we were also requested by dhs to provide the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in the district of columbia and virginia and we provided the requested documents in january 2011 we have received additional requests for work authorization documents covering a small number of individual restaurants as well and ice’s investigation remains ongoing in april 2011 we also received notice from the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia that it is conducting an investigation into these matters through its criminal division the operating hours of our minnesota dc and virginia restaurants have been uninterrupted by these developments and we believe our practices with regard to the work authorization of our employees including the review and retention of work authorization documents are in compliance with applicable law however the termination of large numbers of employees in a short period of time does disrupt our operations and results in a temporary increase in labor costs as we train new employees it is not possible at this time to determine whether we will incur any fines penalties or further liabilities in connection with these matters 

  

miscellaneous 

a lawsuit has been filed against us in california alleging violations of state laws regarding employee recordkeeping meal and rest breaks payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees the case originally sought damages penalties and attorney’s fees on behalf of a purported class of our present and former employees the trial court denied the plaintiff’s motion to certify the purported class and the california court of appeals affirmed that decision and as a result the action can proceed if at all as an action by a single plaintiff the plaintiff has appealed the court’s denial of class certification and the appeal remains pending although the limitation to a singleplaintiff action significantly minimizes our current potential exposure from the case and we have various defenses due to the possibility of further appeals and the uncertainties of litigation it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from this case 

we’re involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or capital resources however a significant increase in the number of these claims or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than we currently anticipate could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

overview 

chipotle operates fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining through our vision of food with integrity chipotle is seeking better food from using ingredients that are not only fresh but that where possible are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals the land and the farmers who produce the food a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees enables us to develop future leaders from within 

2011 highlights and trends 

restaurant development  as of december 31 2011 we had 1230 restaurants of which 1226 were located throughout the united states two located in toronto canada and two located in london england new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth we opened 150 restaurants in 2011 including one shophouse southeast asian kitchen our new concept serving bowls and banh mi sandwiches we expect to open between 155 and 165 restaurants in 2012 among the expected restaurant openings in 2012 is a restaurant in paris france which will be our first restaurant in france and one shophouse we plan about 30 of the 2012 openings to be what we call “a model” restaurants a model locations are being built primarily in secondary trade areas which have attractive demographics but are typically characterized by lower investment and occupancy costs than our recent traditional restaurant openings our introduction of a model restaurants and our new simpler design which incorporates some a model design elements enabled us to lower the average development costs for new restaurants from about 850000 in 2009 to about 800000 in 2011 we anticipate average development costs for new restaurants to be opened in 2012 to be similar to 2011 

sales growth  average restaurant sales were 2013 million as of december 31 2011 increasing from 1840 million as of december 31 2010 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months our comparable restaurant sales increases were 112 in 2011 and were driven primarily by an increase in customer visits as well as the impact of menu price increases implemented during the year benefiting comparable restaurant sales by 29 comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation due to the uncertain economic environment and difficult comparisons with 2011 we expect 2012 comparable restaurant sales increases to be in the mid single digits 

food with integrity by the end of 2011 we were serving naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants in the us we define naturally raised as coming from animals that are never given antibiotics or added hormones and that are raised responsibly—that is in accordance with our animal welfare standards in addition a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown or sourced locally when in season by which we mean within 350 miles of our restaurant and a portion of the beans we serve is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which they are grown all of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh milk used to make much of our cheese and a portion of our sour cream is 

  

sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing pasture access for their cows we will continue to search for ingredients that not only taste delicious but also benefit local farmers or the environment or otherwise benefit or improve the sustainability of our supply chain 

continuing to serve naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants is one of our primary goals but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so some of our restaurants served conventionally raised chicken or steak for much of 2011 a few markets reverted to conventionally raised beef in early 2012 and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints 

our food costs increased in 2011 as a result of inflationary pressures on almost all of our ingredients particularly avocados beef chicken and dairy we expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2012 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase 

stock repurchases in accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors we purchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of 635 million during 2011 as of december 31 2011 66 million was available to be repurchased under the current repurchase authorization on february 1 2012 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the expenditure of up to an additional 100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b51c authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time subject to market conditions the existing repurchase agreement and the board’s authorization of the repurchases may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

restaurant openings relocations and closures 

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 

 

 results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as our business grows as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase 

revenue 

 

   

the significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to 2379 million of the increase in sales in 2011 of which 928 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year in 2010 restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to 1787 million of the increase in sales of which 752 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2010 

comparable restaurant sales increases contributed 1956 million and 1387 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2011 and 2010 respectively comparable restaurant sales growth in 2011 was due primarily to increases in customer visits as well as the impact of menu price increases implemented during the year the increase in 2010 was primarily driven by increases in customer visits 

food beverage and packaging costs 

 

 food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 due to inflation on most food items including avocados beef chicken and dairy partially offset by the impact of menu price increases we expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2012 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase 

food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 due primarily to favorable food costs primarily rice corn and chicken as a result of our switch to commodity chicken in certain markets due to supply constraints partially offset by the increased cost of barbacoa and steak as we increased the percentage of naturally raised beef we served in our restaurants 

labor costs 

 

 labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2011 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales including the impact of menu price increases partially offset by increased average wage rates due to normal wage inflation as well as labor inefficiencies 

labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales partially offset by increased average wage rates due to normal wage inflation and increased insurance costs 

occupancy costs 

 

   

occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average sales on a partially fixedcost base the benefit of the lower occupancy costs from the a model restaurants was offset by opening proportionately more restaurants in more expensive areas 

other operating costs 

 

 other operating costs remained consistent as a percentage of revenue in 2011 the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base and lower marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue was offset by increased credit card fees resulting from a higher percentage of customers using credit cards as well as increased maintenance of restaurants as they age and general inflationary pressures 

other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base partially offset by increased credit card fees resulting from a higher percentage of customers using credit cards as well as increased purchases of kitchen supplies 

general and administrative expenses 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2011 primarily resulted from an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to awards granted in 2011 with a significantly higher stock price on the date of grant as well as hiring more employees as we grew these increases were partially offset by costs from the biennial all manager conference held during the third quarter of 2010 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from the stockbased compensation awards granted in 2010 costs from the biennial all manager conference and hiring more employees as we grew 

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2012 which takes into consideration that we anticipate materially higher stockbased compensation expense than 2011 due to our higher stock price as well as expenses related to the biennial all manager conference to be held in the third quarter of 2012 

depreciation and amortization 

 

 as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization decreased in 2011 and 2010 as a result of the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

  

interest and other expense 

 

 interest and other expense increased in 2011 due to a loss recognized in the second quarter on our investment in angr holdings llc which operated the restaurants awarded on the television program america’s next great restaurant prior to their closure the recognized losses represent the entire amount of our investment 

income tax provision 

 

 the 2011 effective tax rate increased primarily due to an increase in the state rate smaller benefit from food donations and onetime adjustments partially offset by the onetime employment tax credits we estimate our 2012 annual effective tax rate will be 393 however if certain federal tax credits we’ve benefitted from in 2011 are renewed by congress we estimate our annual effective tax rate would be lower by up to 04 

the 2010 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a onetime benefit recognized in 2009 for prior period meals and entertainment deductions 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2011 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

 

  

 seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of 

  

mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results overall on an annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs we have a cash and shortterm investment balance of 4562 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to repurchase up to an additional 1066 million of our common stock subject to market conditions to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes we also have a long term investments balance of 1282 million which consists of us treasury notes and certificate of deposit products with maturities of 13 months to approximately 2 years we believe that cash from operations together with our cash balance will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

while operations continue to provide cash our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development our total capital expenditures for 2011 were 1511 million and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 160 million to 170 million in 2012 of which 138 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments in 2011 we spent on average about 800000 in development and construction costs per restaurant net of landlord reimbursements the average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from about 850000 in 2009 due to cost savings realized in part from certain cost reduction efforts associated with the development of the a model strategy and our new simpler restaurant design for new restaurants to be opened in 2012 we anticipate average development costs to be similar to 2011 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

  

   

we’re obligated under noncancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor fuel utility costs materials used in the construction of our restaurants and insurance although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs additionally many of our leases require us to pay taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease most of our restaurant locations our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stockonly stock appreciation rights or sosars which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility and expected life assumptions were based on our historical data similarly the compensation expense of performance share awards and sosars with performancebased vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance those estimates are based on a number of assumptions and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different 

  

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for workers’ compensation general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as 500000 and for property which has a 1 million deductible we are self insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2011 were 217 million 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2011 and 2010 once resolved however these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows 

unredeemed gift card balances 

we sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date and from which we do not deduct nonusage fees we recognize revenue from gift cards when i the gift card is redeemed by the customer or ii the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction the determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a period of six months beginning at the date of the gift card sale we have determined 5 of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by us any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend changing interest rates 

we’re exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2011 we had 3828 million in investments including a trust account classified in other assets and 2040 million in fdic insured accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 036 

commodity price risks 

we are also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices 

  

however a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons 

foreign currency exchange risk

 item 1 business tableend general 

chipotle mexican grill inc and its subsidiaries “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operate restaurants throughout the united states as well as two restaurants in toronto canada and one in london england as of december 31 2010 we operated 1084 restaurants our restaurants serve a focused menu of tacos burritos salads and burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla made using fresh ingredients we focus on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on recruiting and retaining top performing people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is exceptional on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment we have grown substantially over the past five years and expect to open between 135 and 145 additional restaurants in 2011 

chipotle began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved today our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

we manage our operations and restaurants based on five regions that all report into a single segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 and our total assets as of december 31 2010 and 2009 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the us 

chipotle mexican grill inc is a delaware corporation our business was founded in colorado in 1993 and mcdonald’s corporation made a series of equity investments in us beginning in february 1998 becoming our majority shareholder in 2000 we completed our initial public offering in january 2006 mcdonald’s sold a portion of its interest in us in the initial public offering sold an additional portion of its interest in us in a secondary offering in may 2006 and disposed of its remaining interest in us in an exchange offer to its shareholders that was completed in october 2006 

our menu and food preparation 

food with integrity serving high quality food is what motivates us and is critical to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food as part of our food with integrity philosophy we believe that using fresh ingredients is not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our ingredients come from and how the animals are raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on where we obtain each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food for example as of december 31 2010 all of our restaurants served carnitas made with naturally raised pork as well as barbacoa made with naturally raised beef also as of december 31 2010 about 80 of our restaurants served naturally raised steak and about 86 of our restaurants served naturally raised chicken as a result of ongoing supply challenges we had to suspend serving naturally raised chicken in certain markets beginning in the second quarter of 2010 we expect additional supplies of naturally raised chicken to become available during 2011 we define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet never given antibiotics or hormones and raised humanely our definition is more stringent than the us department of agriculture’s standard for naturally raised marketing claims in addition we work with leading animal welfare authorities to try to support more humane farming practices 

  

we’re also investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees while still charging reasonable prices for our food today about 40 of all of the beans we buy are organically grown—that is they meet us food and drug administration standards for “organic” in 2011 a portion of our beans – about 5 based on our current expectations – will be grown using conservation tillage methods which improves soil conditions reduces erosion and helps preserve the environment in which they are grown as of the end of 2010 about 78 of the cilantro we serve was organic during 2010 we exceeded our local produce goal by purchasing about 94 million pounds of produce that travelled 350 miles or less from the farm to our restaurants we expect to increase the amount of local produce purchased during 2011 

our food with integrity commitment extends to the dairy products we serve as well all of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh or recombinant bovine growth hormone which stimulates milk production by the end of 2010 about 76 of the cheese used in our restaurants was made using milk from cows that are given access to pasture as opposed to being kept in confinement and we expect to increase that percentage during 2011 

we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity for example current economic conditions have led to natural chicken and steak supply shortages it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers meeting our criteria and there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients the growing time for naturally raised meat and sustainably grown vegetables can be longer herd losses can also be greater when animals are not treated with antibiotics and hormones and field losses can be higher for organically grown produce given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area however we believe that consumers’ increasing concern about where and how food is raised and the taste and health benefits of their food and about the environmental management animal husbandry and labor practices of food suppliers will continue to foster demand for these natural and sustainable foods over the longterm we believe that increased demand for naturally raised meat and produce over the longterm will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers we also understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if we are able to continue growing while focusing on food with integrity our sourcing flexibility should improve over time though we expect that most of these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than commoditypriced equivalents 

a few things thousands of ways we serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices we plan to keep a simple menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense and if you can’t find something on the menu that’s quite what you’re after let us know if we can make it from the ingredients we have we’ll do it 

in preparing our food we use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated and grilled in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef and pinto and vegetarian black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt in addition to sodas fruit drinks and organic milk most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in commissaries 

  

food served fast … so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that have prepared the food while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a “fastfood” experience even when they’re not in a hurry and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we’re focused on further improving the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic for instance our restaurants accept orders by fax online or through an iphone ordering application in order to provide a more convenient experience by allowing customers to avoid standing in line we have installed change machines at the cashier station in virtually all of our restaurants and have implemented a handheld pointofsale terminal in a small number of our restaurants which allows customers to pay with a credit card while waiting in line we continue to focus on scheduling and deployment to improve the speed of service by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our restaurants we believe that we can provide the chipotle experience to more and more customers 

quality assurance and food safety chipotle is committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs for our supply chains our training and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable federal state and local food safety regulations 

restaurant management and operations 

culture of high performers we value the individuality of our company our employees and our customers which we believe results in a management operations and training philosophy distinct from that of our competitors we are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our customers the foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best teams in our restaurants we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards but that allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower others we provide hands on shoulder to shoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees through language programs our spanishspeaking workers learn english which helps our crew provide better customer service and provides greater career opportunities this program helps encourage our staff members to develop skills that will enhance their work experience and enrich their personal lives we are committed to developing our people and promoting from within with almost 90 of salaried management and more than 95 of hourly management coming from internal promotions our best restaurant managers who run great restaurants and develop strong empowered restaurant teams are promoted to restaurateur and in that role can earn bonuses for developing people we’ve leveraged our outstanding restaurateurs’ leadership by giving select restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring one or more nearby restaurants this provides an opportunity for restaurateurs to develop in field leadership roles one restaurant at a time restaurateurs who have shown they can successfully run four restaurants by developing teams of all top performers including at least one restaurateur thereby creating a culture of high standards constant improvement and empowerment in each of their restaurants may be promoted to apprentice team leaders 

  

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques and microwaves used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats handchop produce and herbs make fresh salsa and guacamole and steam rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a typical fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants 

the front line is key our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to have genuine interactions with customers no matter their job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer “one entree at a time” we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among restaurant managers crew members and customers alike 

the basics each restaurant typically has a restaurant manager a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an apprentice manager in about threequarters of our restaurants one or two hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 22 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people greater variety and the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our restaurant managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day and although they may increase our labor costs we believe that the benefits we provide to our employees which include language training and a company car program for qualified restaurant managers help us to attract and keep top performing restaurant managers and crew members in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes apprentice team leaders team leaders or area managers team or operations directors and regional directors 

provisions and supplies 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers we purchase from various suppliers carefully selected based on quality and their understanding of our mission and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages and we follow industry news trade issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices 

we generally do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers but have selected and approved all of the suppliers from whom ingredients are purchased for our restaurants distribution centers purchase ingredients and other supplies from suppliers we select based on our quality specifications and purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers 

distribution arrangements we deliver ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants from 22 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers as we continue to expand geographically we expect to add additional regional distribution centers 

  

marketing 

our marketing has historically been based on the belief that the best and most recognizable brands aren’t built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone but rather through all of the ways people experience the brand so we pay close attention to all of these variables looking to keep our communications closely aligned with the ways our customers experience chipotle our advertising and promotional programs instore communications and other design elements such as menus and signs all say something about who we are and we believe it’s important that we present our brand consistently in our communications and the experience our customers enjoy that has always been a hallmark of our marketing and we are constantly looking to do these things better 

when we open a new restaurant we plan a range of activities to introduce chipotle to the local community and to create interest in the restaurant from the start our advertising has generally included print outdoor transit and radio ads but we are also incorporating online advertising into the mix and adding strategic promotions that demonstrate how chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts or that connect us to likeminded individuals or organizations in addition we continue to generate considerable media coverage with scores of publications writing favorably about our food restaurant concept and business and our food restaurants and company have been featured in a number of television programs 

collectively these efforts have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity with our customers learning about us and telling others allowing us to build awareness with relatively low advertising expenditures 

we also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture to this end we have developed and introduced new logos advertising and other branding elements and are increasingly aligning our marketing message around our emphasis on making great tasting food using the best quality ingredients from more sustainable sources and prepared using classic cooking techniques we continue to review our entire marketing strategy and messaging approach to make it more effective and are developing new strategies including a loyalty program that will reward our customers for their knowledge of chipotle and a greater emphasis on web and mobile channels that we intend to implement in 2011 as well as our involvement with the upcoming nbc reality television program “america’s next great restaurant” our goals are to effectively encourage customers to discover how chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts and ensure that our marketing message resonates more with our customers 

competition 

the fastcasual segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented in addition fastcasual restaurants compete against other segments of the restaurant industry including quickservice restaurants and casual dining restaurants the number size and strength of competitors vary by region market and even restaurant all of these restaurants compete based on a number of factors including taste quality speed of service price and value name recognition restaurant location customer service and the ambience and condition of each restaurant 

we compete with national and regional fastcasual quickservice and casual dining restaurants our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources have been in business longer and have greater name recognition than we have and are better established than we are in the markets where our restaurants are located or are planned to be located 

we believe we’re wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends including the increasing impact of hispanic culture on food the growth of the mexican food segment and increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared some of our competitors have formats that might resemble ours we believe however that chipotle has become one of the most recognized fastcasual restaurants and that we are known for our focus on preparing 

  

food using a variety of fresh ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food as well as our commitment to “food with integrity” which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate 

restaurant site selection 

we believe that site selection is critical to our success and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential location our site selection process includes the use of external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets taking direction from our internal team of real estate managers locations proposed by real estate managers are reviewed on site by a team of operations and development management as part of a formal site ride as well as in a written real estate package we study the surrounding trade area demographic and business information within that area and available information on competitors based on this analysis including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment we have been successful in a number of different types of locations such as inline or endcap locations in strip or power centers regional malls downtown business districts freestanding buildings and even an airport location 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year 

our intellectual property and trademarks 

“chipotle” “chipotle mexican grill” “unburritable” “food with integrity” “fresh is not enough anymore” “the gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands” and a number of related designs and logos are us registered trademarks of chipotle we have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the us in addition to our us registrations we have registered trademarks for “chipotle” and a number of other marks in canada the european union and various other countries and have filed trademark applications for “chipotle mexican grill” “chipotle” and a number of other marks in various countries as well 

we also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress from time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks restaurant designs or advertising although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 

information systems 

chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office this system includes a pointofsales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant additionally the pointofsales system is used to authorize batch and transmit credit card transactions to record employee time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis which enables management to continually monitor operating results we believe that our current pointofsales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had about 26500 employees including about 2370 salaried employees and about 24130 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

test concept development 

we believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are based – finding the very best sustainably raised ingredients prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experience – can be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at chipotle in order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food we plan to open one asianinspired restaurant during 2011 our focus however will remain on thoughtfully growing the chipotle brand

 item 1a risk factors tableend cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

this report includes statements of our expectations intentions plans and beliefs that constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections these statements which involve risks and uncertainties relate to the discussion of our business strategies and our expectations concerning future operations margins profitability liquidity and capital resources and to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable forwardlooking statements include our projections of the number of restaurants we expect to open in 2011 our estimates of the amount of certain expected expenses and potential changes in our comparable restaurant sales during 2011 statements of our intention to open restaurants in one or more specified locations and statements regarding the potential impact of ongoing economic uncertainty on our business we have used words such as “may” “will” “should” “expect” “intend” “plan” “anticipate” “believe” “think” “estimate” “seek” “expect” “predict” “could” “project” “potential” and other similar terms and phrases including references to assumptions in this report to identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties risks and factors relating to our operations and business environments all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements such risks and other factors include those listed in this item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

when considering these forwardlooking statements you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and the documents incorporated by reference new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time and 

  

we cannot predict those events or how they may affect us we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information future events or developments except as required by applicable laws and regulations 

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants which is subject to many unpredictable factors 

there were 1084 chipotle restaurants as of december 31 2010 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years and plan to open between 135 and 145 new restaurants in 2011 weighted towards the fourth quarter of the year however we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 one of our biggest challenges is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for those sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors may be exacerbated by any ongoing sluggishness in commercial real estate or credit markets as developers may continue to delay or be unable to finance new projects delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline which may in turn slow our sales and profitability growth 

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods similarly our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits we expect that our new restaurant openings in 2011 will be weighted more heavily to the fourth quarter of the year with openings in the first quarter being approximately half of our new restaurant openings during the first quarter of 2010 the weighting of openings to the fourth quarter of 2011 may adversely affect our revenue growth during the first three quarters of the year and our profitability in the fourth quarter 

  

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales increases are less than we expect and we may not successfully increase comparable restaurant sales 

while future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants changes in comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the higher profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales we expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2011 to be in the low single digits due to difficult comparisons with 2010 and ongoing consumer uncertainty 

our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a number of these factors are beyond our control as a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative if this were to happen sales and profit growth would be adversely affected and our stock price would be likely to decline 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area higher fixed costs relating to increased labor and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants and a larger proportion of our recent openings being in higher rent sites than we have historically targeted if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable we also have lowered the average development cost of our new restaurants significantly in 

  

recent years from 916000 in 2008 to 795000 in 2010 and expect development costs in 2011 to be similar to 2010 in the event we are not able to achieve the average development costs we expect for 2011 or sustain the benefits achieved in prior years which could result from inflation project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability 

in addition we have now opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions global demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and soy oil has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice increasing our food costs although the food price environment was generally favorable for us during 2010 food prices began to escalate at the end of the year and we expect that there will be additional and potentially worsening pricing pressures on some of our key ingredients including beef dairy avocados and chicken during 2011 we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to naturallyraised meats or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for commodity food products weather related issues such as recent freezes in mexico and florida may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as tomatoes any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as beef chicken cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such as one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like competition increased minimum wage requirements employee benefits and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees especially restaurant managers and crew members our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or require us to change our culture any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly 

various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs as well some of these changes may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees although we require all workers to provide 

  

us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees for example following an audit by the department of homeland security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota during 2010 we were required to terminate approximately 450 employees resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs as we train new employees as well as some degree of negative publicity we are currently undergoing a similar audit in virginia and the district of columbia termination of a significant number of employees in those or other markets or across our company may disrupt our operations cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity our financial performance could be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors 

because we do not franchise risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring payment and termination of employees and employeerelated litigation may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees 

instances of foodborne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants or result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales and could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat produce or dairy we use to prepare our food 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry which could adversely affect sales for instance on a small number of occasions a chipotle restaurant has been associated with customer illness and on those occasions our sales have been adversely impacted at times even in markets beyond those impacted by the illness if our customers become ill from foodborne or localized illnesses we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants would adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability 

in addition reports linking a nationwide outbreak of salmonella during the summer of 2008 to a variety of fresh produce items caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu similarly past outbreaks of e coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems other foodborne illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse affect on the price and availability of affected ingredients if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas 

some of our new restaurants are located in or planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience for instance we opened a restaurant in london in 2010 our first restaurant outside of north america and plan to open a restaurant in paris during the second half of 2011 as well new markets particularly outside the united states may have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as a result new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the chipotle brand and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional 

  

activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture restaurants opened in new markets particularly outside the united states may also have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher construction occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets we may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall profitability some or all of these factors may be more pronounced in markets outside the united states due to cultural regulatory or economic differences with which we are not familiar which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could thereby adversely impact our overall results our overall results may also be affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results or the brand identity that we have tried to create consumers may also be more pricesensitive during difficult economic times and we experienced some decrease in traffic during late 2008 and throughout 2009 that we attribute in part to menu price increases recent reports have indicated continued consumer uncertainty that may continue during 2011 so our ability to increase sales may be significantly hampered for the foreseeable future if we do elect to increase menu prices it may adversely impact our customer traffic 

governmental regulation may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results including by harming our ability to open new restaurants 

we are subject to various federal state and local regulations for example we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act or ada and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws the expenses associated with these modifications or any damages legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ada or similar state laws could be material during 2010 an appeals court in california found that the design we formerly used for our serving line had violated the ada and although we are pursuing an appeal of that ruling in the event we are not successful in an appeal losses in that case or related class actions may exceed our accruals and could have a material impact on us 

we are also subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules and antidiscrimination laws complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for noncompliance for example a lawsuit has been filed against us in california alleging violations of state laws regarding employee recordkeeping meal and rest breaks payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees we could suffer losses in this case or similar cases and any such losses could be significant in addition several states in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases and these increases could increase our labor costs we also are audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well and recent audit activity in this area is described in more detail above under 

  

“ our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants ” unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees we could also experience adverse publicity arising from immigrationrelated enforcement activity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees 

from time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various of the laws and regulations that cover our business the majority of this litigation occurs in california even though currently only about 15 of our restaurants are located there as we continue to expand in california or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in california our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in or minimized our operations in california 

a comprehensive us health care reform law was enacted in 2010 we are evaluating the impact the new law will have on our employees although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have on us we expect that our expenses will significantly increase over the long term as a result of the law particularly in 2014 under the current version of the law and any such increases could be large enough to materially impact our results of operations 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and a growing number of other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available the us health care reform law included nationwide menu labeling and nutrition disclosure requirements as well and our restaurants are covered by these national requirements initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales 

each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

because we do not franchise the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business as described above may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees 

  

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover new companies may enter our markets and target our customers for example additional competitive pressures have come more recently from the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to adhere to the principle of food with integrity we use a substantial amount of naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients and try to make our food as fresh as we can in light of pricing considerations we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers meeting our criteria and there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients the growth process for naturally raised meat and sustainably grown vegetables is longer herd losses can also be greater when animals are not treated with antibiotics and hormones given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area we expect shortages of naturallyraised chicken for at least the first half of 2011 due to a supplier suspending production furthermore as we increase our use of these ingredients the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained moreover we are broadening our commitment to serving local produce and produce purchased from farmers markets when seasonally available these initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent and present additional risk of foodborne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers quality variations and foodborne illness concerns could adversely impact public perceptions of food with integrity or our brand generally if as a result of any of these factors we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis or at all our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with food with integrity which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline our commitment to food with integrity may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our food with integrity approach any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants 

  

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations we have almost no longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on the same third party distribution network as mcdonald’s corporation if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our food with integrity suppliers and as described in more detail above these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels negative consumer sentiment in the wake of the economic downturn has been widely reported over the past two years and according to some forecasts will continue during 2011 our sales may decline during this or future economic downturns which can be caused by various factors such as high gasoline prices high unemployment declining home prices or tight credit markets any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain restaurant managers and crew we also are continuing to revise our field management structure in an effort to develop additional topperforming restaurant managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results 

  

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability and property damage we are selfinsured for our health plans and have purchased a fullyinsured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability and property damage insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our success may be dependent on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

our chairman and cochief executive officer steve ells founded our company has been the principal architect of our business strategy and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 1000 restaurants today monty moran our cochief executive officer and jack hartung our chief financial officer have also served with us for several years and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well we believe our executive officers have created an employee culture food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team we also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision if our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership or a new management team were to change or be unsuccessful in implementing our strategy our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted 

our new marketing and branding strategies may not be successful which could adversely impact our business 

over the past two years we have been refocusing our marketing and branding strategy as part of this initiative we developed and introduced new logos a new advertising approach new restaurant design and other branding elements we also plan to introduce a unique loyalty program during 2011 and are planning a number of mediarelated events to further promote our brand we do not have any assurance that our latest marketing strategies will be successful if new advertising modified branding and other marketing programs do not drive increased restaurant sales the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect in addition one of our marketing initiatives during 2011 is the participation by steve ells our founder chairman and cochief executive officer as a judge on the nbc reality television program “america’s next great restaurant” we do not control the timing or content of or the portrayal of our brand on the program as a result we may not realize the marketing value we hope to achieve from it and our brand may be portrayed in a negative light adversely impacting us 

we may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2010 approximately 57 of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers including us have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen in august 2004 the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data as a result we recorded losses and related expenses totaling 43 million from 2004 through 2006 

  

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

the impact on us of continuing economic uncertainty may be exacerbated if our suppliers landlords and other counterparties are not able to continue to do business with us or are forced to alter the terms on which they do business with us 

some of our suppliers and other vendors have been or will be adversely impacted by tightening of the credit markets decreased economic activity fluctuations in commodity prices and other consequences of ongoing economic difficulties some vendors have sought to change the terms on which they do business with us in order to lessen the impact of the economic environment on their business if we are forced to find alternative vendors for key services whether due to demands from the vendor or the vendor’s bankruptcy or ceasing operations that could be a distraction to us and adversely impact our business 

for example we are aware that the economic environment has forced some food suppliers to seek financing in order to stabilize their businesses and some suppliers have ceased operations completely additional suppliers may encounter difficulties in sustaining their business and if any of our major suppliers or a large number of other suppliers suspend or cease operations we may not be able to further our food with integrity initiative and may have difficulty keeping our restaurants fully supplied with the high quality ingredients we require if we were forced to suspend serving one or more of our menu items that could have a significant adverse impact on our restaurant traffic and public perceptions of us which would be harmful to our business 

similarly our restaurant expansion strategy relies in part on the development of new retail centers and similar projects many developers rely on the availability of financing to complete these types of projects and due to current conditions in the credit and commercial real estate markets financing may not be available on attractive terms or at all developers may also delay or cancel projects in light of uncertainty in the commercial real estate market or economic conditions generally if developers do not proceed with projects in which we plan to locate restaurants our expansion plans may be hampered which would adversely impact our growth and could impair our future profitability 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

  

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 seasonal factors also cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our revenue will also vary as a result of the number of trading days that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall we believe the market price of our common stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results and as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from mcdonald’s could adversely affect us 

we understand that the exchange offer mcdonald’s completed in october 2006 to dispose of its interest in us was generally taxfree to mcdonald’s and its shareholders in order to protect the taxfree status of the exchange offer in the separation agreement we entered into with mcdonald’s in connection with the separation we agreed among other things to indemnify mcdonald’s for taxes and related losses it incurs as a result of the 

  

exchange failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction in certain situations if the taxes and related losses are attributable to i certain direct or indirect acquisitions of our stock or assets regardless of whether we consent to such acquisitions ii negotiations understandings agreements or arrangements in respect of such acquisitions or iii any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that affects the relative voting rights of any separate classes of our common stock in december 2009 following completion of an extensive due diligence process we completed a share conversion eliminating the existence of our class b common stock and with it the superior voting rights of the class b common stock in the event the share conversion is deemed to result in the mcdonald’s exchange offer failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction we may have an indemnification obligation under the provision described above we currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s could exceed 450 million and this estimate does not take into account related losses and depends upon several factors that are beyond our control as a consequence the indemnity to mcdonald’s could vary substantially from the estimate and may be much greater 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with mcdonald’s described above under “ restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from mcdonald’s could adversely affect us ” may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend california ada cases 

in 2006 maurizio antoninetti filed suit against us in the us district court for the southern district of california primarily claiming that the height of the serving line wall in our restaurants violated the americans with disabilities act or ada as well as california disability laws on december 6 2006 mr antoninetti filed an additional lawsuit in the same court making the same allegations on a class action basis on behalf of himself and a purported class of disabled individuals and a similar class action was filed by james perkins in us district court for the central district of california on may 7 2008 

in the individual antoninetti action the district court entered a ruling in which it found that although our counter height violated the ada we provided the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation and awarded attorney’s fees and minimal damages to the plaintiff we and the plaintiff appealed the district court’s ruling to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit and on july 26 2010 the appeals court entered a ruling finding that we violated the ada and did not provide the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation and remanded the case to the district court 

we are pursuing an appeal of the recent ruling from the appeals court in the individual antoninetti action in the event we are not successful in the appeal we will vigorously defend the class action ada cases we lowered the height of our serving line walls throughout california some time ago which makes injunctive relief in these actions moot and have the lower serving lines in a significant majority of our restaurants outside of california as well we also expect to contest certification of a plaintiff class in these actions it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from these cases 

notices of inspection of work authorization documents 

following an audit during 2010 by the us department of homeland security or dhs of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in minnesota the immigration and customs enforcement arm of dhs or ice issued to us a notice of suspect documents identifying a large number of employees who according to ice and notwithstanding our review of work authorization documents for each employee at the time they were hired appeared not to be authorized to work in the us we approached each of the named employees to explain ice’s determination and afforded each employee an opportunity to confirm the validity of their original work eligibility documents or provide valid work eligibility documents employees who were unable to provide valid work eligibility documents were terminated in accordance with the law in december 2010 we were also requested by dhs to provide the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in the district of columbia and virginia and we provided the requested documents in january 2011 we have received additional requests for work authorization documents covering a small number of individual restaurants the operating hours of our minnesota dc and virginia restaurants have been uninterrupted by these developments and we believe our practices with regard to the work authorization of our employees including the review and retention of work authorization documents are in compliance with applicable law however the termination of large numbers of employees does disrupt our operations and results in a temporary increase in labor costs as we train new employees it is not possible at this time to determine whether we will incur any fines penalties or further liabilities in connection with these matters 

  

miscellaneous 

a lawsuit has been filed against us in california alleging violations of state laws regarding employee recordkeeping meal and rest breaks payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees the case originally sought damages penalties and attorney’s fees on behalf of a purported class of our present and former employees the trial court denied the plaintiff’s motion to certify the purported class and the california court of appeals affirmed that decision and as a result the action can proceed if at all as an action by a single plaintiff the plaintiff has appealed the court’s denial of class certification and the appeal remains pending although the limitation to a singleplaintiff action significantly minimizes our current potential exposure from the case and we have various defenses due to the possibility of further appeals and the uncertainties of litigation it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from this case 

we’re involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or capital resources however a significant increase in the number of these claims or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than we currently anticipate could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

overview 

chipotle operates fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved today our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

2010 highlights and trends 

restaurant development  as of december 31 2010 we had 1084 restaurants of which 1081 were located throughout the united states two were located in toronto canada and one was located in london england new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth we opened 129 restaurants in 2010 we expect to open between 135 and 145 restaurants in 2011 among the expected restaurant openings in 2011 is a restaurant in paris france which will be our first restaurant in france about 30 of the 2011 openings will be what we call “a model” restaurants a model locations are being built primarily in secondary trade areas which have attractive demographics but are typically characterized by lower investment and occupancy costs than our recent traditional restaurant openings our introduction of a model restaurants and our new simpler design which incorporates some a model design elements enabled us to lower the average development costs for new restaurants from 850000 in 2009 to 795000 in 2010 we anticipate average development costs for new restaurants to be opened in 2011 to be approximately the same as in 2010 

sales growth  average restaurant sales were 1840 million as of december 31 2010 increasing from 1728 million as of december 31 2009 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months our comparable restaurant sales increases were 94 in 2010 and were driven primarily by an increase in customer visits comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation we expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2011 to be in the low single digits due to difficult comparisons with 2010 and ongoing consumer uncertainty 

food with integrity we continue to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants in 2010 we increased the percentage of our restaurants serving barbacoa made with naturally raised beef to 100 and increased the percentage of our restaurants serving naturally raised steak to about 80 we began the year serving naturally raised chicken in all our restaurants but increased sales and ongoing supply challenges caused us to suspend serving it in certain markets we reached a point we could only buy naturally raised chicken for 80 of our restaurants in the second quarter but increased that to 86 of our restaurants as of december 31 2010 we hope to be back to 100 naturally raised chicken during the first half of 2011 which will increase food costs we define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet never given antibiotics or hormones and raised humanely our definition is more stringent than the usda’s standard for naturally raised marketing claims 

  

we began our local produce program in 2008 and have increased the amount of local produce purchased each subsequent year during 2010 we exceeded our goal by purchasing about 94 million pounds of locally grown produce we define locally grown produce as produce that travels no more than 350 miles from the farm to our restaurants also for 2010 40 of all the beans we bought were organically grown up from 35 in 2009 we increased the percentage of organically grown cilantro used in our restaurants to 78 by the end of 2010 additionally 76 of the cheese used in our restaurants as of the end of 2010 was made using milk from cows given access to pasture as opposed to being kept in confinement like most dairy cows 

due to inflationary pressures recent freezes in mexico and florida and continued food with integrity initiatives we expect food costs as a percentage of revenue to increase during 2011 

stock repurchases in accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors we purchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of 1159 million during 2010 as of december 31 2010 701 million was available to be repurchased under the current repurchase authorization we have entered into an agreement with a broker authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time subject to market conditions the repurchase agreement and the board’s authorization of the repurchases may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated 

 

 results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as our business grows as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase 

revenue 

 

   

the significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to 1787 million of the increase in sales in 2010 of which 752 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year in 2009 restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to 1617 million of the increase in sales of which 736 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2009 

comparable restaurant sales increases contributed 1387 million and 263 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in 2010 was primarily driven by increases in customer visits the increase in 2009 was primarily driven by the impact of menu price increases initiated beginning in late 2008 in 2009 the impact of the menu price increases was partially offset by a decrease in customer visits and the average check not increasing by the full amount of the menu price increases 

food beverage and packaging costs 

 

 food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 due primarily to favorable food costs primarily rice and corn as well as chicken as a result of our switch to commodity chicken in certain markets due to supply constraints which we are working to alleviate as soon as possible the decrease was partially offset by the increased cost of barbacoa and steak as we increased the percentage of naturally raised beef we serve in our restaurants we expect to see food costs increase as a percentage of revenue in 2011 due to inflationary pressures recent freezes in mexico and florida and food with integrity initiatives 

food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 due primarily to the impact of menu price increases 

labor costs 

 

 labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales partially offset by increased average wage rates and increased insurance costs 

labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases and labor efficiencies partially offset by increased average wage rates and lower transaction volumes 

occupancy costs 

 

   

occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average sales on a partially fixedcost base the benefit of the lower occupancy costs from the a model restaurants was offset by opening proportionately more restaurants in more expensive areas 

occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 primarily due to higher average rents for new locations as we opened proportionately more restaurants in more expensive areas than we have historically 

other operating costs 

 

 other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base partially offset by increased credit card fees resulting from a higher percentage of customers using credit cards as well as increased purchases of kitchen supplies 

other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases and decreased marketing and promotional expenditures 

general and administrative expenses 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from the stockbased compensation awards granted in 2010 costs from the biennial all manager conference and hiring more employees as we grew as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses remained consistent with 2009 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base offset by the expenses listed above 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2009 primarily resulted from an increase in performance related bonus accruals an increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from the stockbased compensation awards granted in 2009 wage inflation and hiring more employees as we grew this increase was partially offset by careful management of expenses primarily travel costs as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses decreased in 2009 due primarily to the impact of menu price increases and lower travel costs partially offset by the expenses listed above 

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to remain consistent in 2011 with the previous two years which takes into consideration that we anticipate materially higher stockbased compensation expense than 2010 due to our higher stock price 

depreciation and amortization 

 

   

depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2010 as a result of the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization remained constant in 2009 compared to 2008 

preopening costs 

 

 preopening costs decreased in 2010 as a result of cost control efforts around restaurant preopening activities and lower preopening rent due to the shorter development cycle of the a model restaurants 

preopening costs decreased in 2009 as a result of a decrease in the number of restaurants opened and under construction in 2009 partially offset by an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period due to higher rents for more expensive locations preopening costs include noncash straightline rent expense of 42 million 44 million and 59 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

loss on disposal of assets 

 

 loss on disposal of assets increased in 2010 as a result of an impairment charge related to a restaurant closure partially offset by lower costs as a result of a comprehensive maintenance and repair program instituted over the last couple of years and continued assessment of and in some cases adjustments to our estimated useful lives 

loss on disposal of assets decreased in 2009 as a result of decreases in the number of remodels and in writeoffs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected and also as a result of our not recording any restaurant impairment charges 

interest and other income 

 

 interest and other income increased in 2010 primarily due to higher average cash balances throughout the year and higher yields on our investments 

interest and other income decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower yields on our investments these decreases were partially offset by a higher average cash balance and fewer taxexempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes 

  

income tax provision 

 

 the 2010 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a onetime benefit recognized in 2009 for prior period meals and entertainment deductions 

the 2009 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a onetime benefit for prior period meals and entertainment deductions and 2008 federal tax return adjustments a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate and an increase in deductions for food donations partially offset by a reduction in earnings on taxexempt investments 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2010 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

 

  

 seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results overall on an annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs we have a cash and shortterm investment balance of 3496 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to repurchase up to an additional 701 million of our common stock subject to market conditions to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes we believe that cash from operations together with our cash balance will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

in february 2009 we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america na with an initial principal amount of 25 million and an additional 25 million accordion feature borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate set at our option at either i an adjusted libor rate plus a margin ranging from 075 to 20 depending on a leaseadjusted leverage ratio or ii a daily rate equal to a the highest of the federal funds rate plus 05 the bank’s published prime rate or onemonth libor plus 10 plus b a margin ranging from 00 to 10 depending on a leaseadjusted leverage ratio the facility includes a commitment fee on the unused balance ranging from 025 to 05 based on the leaseadjusted leverage ratio availability of borrowings under the facility is conditioned on our compliance with specified covenants including a maximum leaseadjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2010 as of december 31 2010 there were no amounts outstanding and available borrowings were 25 million we have provided the bank with written notice of termination of the credit facility to be effective february 23 2011 

while operations continue to provide cash our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development our total capital expenditures for 2010 were 1132 million and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 131 million in 2011 of which 111 million relates to our construction of new restaurants and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments in 2010 we spent on average about 795000 in development and construction costs per restaurant net of landlord reimbursements the average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from 850000 in 2009 due to cost savings realized in part from certain cost reduction efforts associated with the development of the a model strategy and our new simpler restaurant design for new restaurants to be opened in 2011 we anticipate average development costs to be approximately the same as in 2010 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

  

   

we’re obligated under noncancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor fuel utility costs materials used in the construction of our restaurants and insurance although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs additionally many of our leases require us to pay taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease most of our restaurant locations our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumptions were derived from our actual volatilities had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options and stock appreciation rights our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different 

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for workers’ compensation general liability property and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as 500000 we are self insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our 

  

history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31 2010 were 167 million 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2010 and 2009 once resolved however these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows 

sabbatical liability 

we offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete we record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense 

unredeemed gift card balances 

we sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date and from which we do not deduct nonusage fees we recognize revenue from gift cards when i the gift card is redeemed by the customer or ii the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction the determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a period of six months beginning at the date of the gift card sale we have determined 5 of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by us any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend changing interest rates 

we’re exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2010 we had 2121 million deposited in shortterm investments including a trust account classified in other assets and 1407 million in fdic insured accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 049 approximately 051 tax equivalent 

commodity price risks 

we are also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices 

  

however a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the us and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the us dollar however a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the us and therefore our foreign currency risk is limited at this date

 item 1 business tableend general 

chipotle mexican grill inc “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operates 956 restaurants in 35 states throughout the united states the district of columbia and ontario canada as of december 31 2009 our restaurants serve a focused menu of tacos burritos salads and burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla made using fresh ingredients we are focused on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on recruiting and retaining top performing people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is exceptional on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment we have grown substantially over the past five years and expect to open between 120 and 130 additional restaurants in 2010 

chipotle began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved today our vision is to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

we manage our operations and restaurants based on five regions that all report into a single segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 and our total assets as of december 31 2009 and 2008 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the us 

chipotle mexican grill inc is a delaware corporation our business was founded in colorado in 1993 and mcdonald’s corporation made a series of equity investments in us beginning in february 1998 becoming our majority shareholder in 2000 we completed our initial public offering in january 2006 mcdonald’s sold a portion of its interest in us in the initial public offering sold an additional portion of its interest in us in a secondary offering in may 2006 and disposed of its remaining interest in us in an exchange offer to its shareholders that was completed in october 2006 

our menu and food preparation 

food with integrity more than anything serving high quality food is what motivates us and is the cornerstone of our vision to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food as part of our food with integrity philosophy we believe that using fresh ingredients is not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our ingredients come from and how the animals are raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on where we obtain each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food all of our pork and all of our chicken for example is naturally raised we define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet never given antibiotics or hormones and raised in open pastures or deeply bedded pens—which is more stringent than the usda’s standard for naturally raised marketing claims we also serve naturally raised beef in about 60 of our restaurants in addition we work with leading animal ethicists to try to support more humane farming practices we’re also investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees while still charging reasonable prices for our food today about 40 of all of the beans we buy are organically grown—that is they meet us food and drug 

  

administration standards for “organic” all of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh or recombinant bovine growth hormone to stimulate milk production by the end of 2009 about 30 of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage during 2010 during 2009 we met our goal of purchasing at least 35 of at least one produce item while in season in each of our markets from small to midsize local farmers and we expect to increase that percentage during 2010 as well 

we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity for example current economic conditions have led to periodic natural chicken supply shortages as a result we have on occasion temporarily suspended serving naturally raised chicken in certain limited restaurants for short periods of time and we expect these shortages will continue during 2010 it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers meeting our criteria and there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients the growth process for naturally raised meat and sustainably grown vegetables is longer herd losses can also be greater when animals are not treated with antibiotics and hormones given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area we believe that consumers’ increasing concern about where and how food is raised and the taste and health benefits of their food and about the environmental management animal husbandry and labor practices of food suppliers will continue to foster demand for these natural and sustainable foods over the longterm we believe that increased demand for naturally raised meat and produce over the longterm will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers we also understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if we are able to continue growing while focusing on food with integrity our sourcing flexibility should improve over time though we expect that these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than commoditypriced equivalents for some time to come 

a few things thousands of ways we serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices we plan to keep a simple menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense and if you can’t find something on the menu that’s quite what you’re after let us know if we can make it from the ingredients we have we’ll do it 

in preparing our food we use stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated and grilled in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef and pinto and vegetarian black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt in addition to sodas and fruit drinks most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas our food is prepared from scratch with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in commissaries with the exception of the sweet corn for one of our salsas our ingredients are never frozen and we never use microwaves in the preparation of our food 

food served fast … so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that have prepared the food while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a “fastfood” experience even when they’re not in a hurry and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving 

  

line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we’re focused on further improving the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic for instance our restaurants accept orders over the internet by fax online or through an iphone ordering application in order to provide a more convenient experience by allowing customers to avoid standing in line we have installed change machines at the cashier station in virtually all of our restaurants and have implemented a handheld pointofsale terminal in a small number of our restaurants which allows customers to pay with a credit card while waiting in line we continue to review other equipment and kitchen design modifications to improve the speed of service by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our restaurants we believe that we can provide the chipotle experience to more and more customers 

quality assurance and food safety chipotle is committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs our training department develops and implements operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable state and local food safety regulations 

restaurant management and operations 

culture of high performers we value the individuality of our company our employees and our customers which we believe results in a management operations and training philosophy distinct from that of our competitors we are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our customers the foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best teams in our restaurants we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards but that allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower others we provide hands on shoulder to shoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees through our language programs that we provide in all of our markets we teach english to spanishspeaking workers which helps our crew provide better customer service and provides greater career opportunities this program helps encourage our staff members to develop skills that will enhance their work experience and enrich their personal lives our best restaurant managers who run great restaurants and develop strong restaurant teams are promoted to restaurateur and in that role can earn bonuses for developing people we’ve leveraged our outstanding restaurateurs’ leadership by giving select restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring nearby restaurants this provides an opportunity for restaurateurs to develop in field leadership roles one restaurant at a time 

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques frozen meats and microwaves used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats handchop produce and herbs make fresh salsa and guacamole and steam rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a typical fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants 

the front line is key our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to have genuine 

  

interactions with customers no matter their job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer “one entree at a time” we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among restaurant managers crew members and customers alike 

the basics each restaurant typically has a restaurant manager a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an apprentice manager one or two hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 21 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people greater variety and the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our restaurant managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day and although they may increase our labor costs we believe that the benefits we provide to our employees which include language training and a company car program for qualified restaurant managers help us to attract and keep top performing restaurant managers and crew members in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes assistant team leaders team leaders or area managers operations directors and regional directors 

provisions and supplies 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high levels of quality we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers we purchase from various suppliers carefully selected based on quality and their understanding of our mission and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages and we follow industry news trade issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices 

we generally do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers but have selected and approved all of the suppliers from whom ingredients are purchased for our restaurants distribution centers purchase ingredients and other supplies from suppliers we select based on our quality specifications and purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers 

distribution arrangements we deliver ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants from 22 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers as we continue to expand geographically we expect to add additional regional distribution centers 

marketing 

our marketing has historically been based on the belief that the best and most recognizable brands aren’t built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone but rather through all of the ways people experience the brand so we pay close attention to all of these variables looking to keep our communications closely aligned with the ways our customers experience chipotle our advertising and promotional programs instore communications and other design elements such as menus and signs all say something about who we are and we believe it’s important that we present our brand consistently in our communications and the experience our customers enjoy that has always been a hallmark of our marketing and we are constantly looking to do these things better 

  

when we open a new restaurant we plan a range of activities to introduce chipotle to the local community and to create interest in the restaurant from the start our advertising has generally included print outdoor transit and radio ads in addition we continue to generate considerable media coverage with scores of publications writing favorably about our food restaurant concept and business and our food restaurants and company have been featured in a number of television programs 

collectively these efforts have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity with our customers learning about us and telling others allowing us to build awareness with relatively low advertising expenditures 

we also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture to help us improve our marketing direction and message to deepen our relationships with customers and continue to attract new customers we hired our first ever chief marketing officer in january 2009 we also developed and introduced new logos advertising and other branding elements in 2009 we continue to review our entire marketing strategy and messaging approach to make it more effective and have developed new advertising and marketing strategies that we intend to implement in 2010 our goals are to effectively communicate how chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts and ensure that our marketing message resonates more with our customers 

competition 

the fastcasual segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented in addition fastcasual restaurants compete against other segments of the restaurant industry including quickservice restaurants and casual dining restaurants the number size and strength of competitors vary by region market and even restaurant all of these restaurants compete based on a number of factors including taste quality speed of service value name recognition restaurant location customer service and the ambience and condition of each restaurant 

we compete with national and regional fastcasual quickservice and casual dining restaurants our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and inrestaurant cafés of several major grocery store chains many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources have been in business longer and have greater name recognition than we have and are better established than we are in the markets where our restaurants are located or are planned to be located 

we believe we’re wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends including the increasing impact of hispanic culture on food the growth of the mexican food segment and increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared some of our competitors have formats similar to ours we believe however that chipotle has become one of the most recognized fastcasual restaurants and that we are known for our focus on preparing food using a variety of fresh ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food as well as our commitment to “food with integrity” which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year 

  

our intellectual property and trademarks 

“chipotle” “chipotle mexican grill” “unburritable” “food with integrity” “fresh is not enough anymore” “the gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands” and a number of related designs and logos are us registered trademarks of chipotle we have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the us in addition to our us registrations we have registered trademarks for “chipotle” and a number of other marks in canada the european union and various other countries and have filed trademark applications for “chipotle mexican grill” “chipotle” and a number of other marks in various countries as well 

we also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress from time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks restaurant designs or advertising although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 

information systems 

chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office this system includes a pointofsales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant additionally the pointofsales system is used to authorize batch and transmit credit card transactions to record employee time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis which enables management to continually monitor operating results we believe that our current pointofsales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had about 22250 employees including about 2090 salaried employees and about 20160 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants which is subject to many unpredictable factors 

there were 956 chipotle restaurants as of december 31 2009 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years and plan to open between 120 and 130 new restaurants in 2010 however we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 one of our biggest challenges is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for those sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations these factors may be exacerbated by any further deterioration of the commercial real estate or credit markets as developers may continue to delay or be unable to finance new projects delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline which may in turn slow our sales and profitability growth 

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods similarly 

  

our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales increases are less than we expect and we may not successfully increase comparable restaurant sales 

while future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants changes in comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base conversely declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the higher profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated during 2009 and we expect comparable restaurant sales in 2010 to be flat due to the impact of ongoing weakness in consumer spending as a result of the economy and losing the impact of menu price increases we implemented beginning in late 2008 if the economy remains weak or further weakens we may further lower our expectations for comparable restaurant sales 

in addition our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a number of these factors are beyond our control as a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative if this were to happen sales and profit growth would be adversely affected and our stock price would be likely to decline 

our new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to 

  

normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area as well as to higher fixed costs relating to increased labor and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants and a larger proportion of our recent openings being in higher rent sites than we have historically targeted if we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable we also have lowered the average development cost of our new restaurants significantly in recent years from 916000 in 2008 to 850000 in 2009 and expect additional decreases in 2010 in the event we are not able to achieve the average development costs we expect for 2010 or sustain the benefits achieved in prior years which could result from inflation project mismanagement or other reasons our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability in addition our average restaurant sales declined and comparable restaurant sales decelerated during 2009 and if these trends continue as a result of ongoing economic uncertainty or otherwise the rampup period for new restaurants may be longer adversely impacting our overall financial results if for any of these reasons new restaurants do not perform as planned or adversely impact our profitability the price of our common stock is likely to decline 

in addition we have now opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the us new restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previouslyopened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead this impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newlyopened restaurants in the same market 

we plan to broaden our real estate selection strategy during 2010 which may result in lower new restaurant sales volumes and potentially lower operating margins 

in 2010 as part of what we refer to as our “a model” initiative we plan to broaden the site selection criteria we use to determine new restaurant locations allowing us to open restaurants outside of the trade areas that we have typically sought while still achieving our targeted economic returns these trade areas may have lower population densities or local traffic or less favorable demographic profiles than the trade areas we have typically sought out for new locations we expect that as many as 25 of our new restaurant openings will be in these types of locations in 2010 this could adversely impact our operating margins notwithstanding the lower development occupancy and operational costs we expect for these locations in addition because we have less experience opening restaurants in these types of trade areas there can be no assurance that restaurants opened in these locations will generate the sales volumes we expect and failure to reach those sales volumes would adversely impact our profitability 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and soy oil has increased markedly in some years resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice increasing our food costs although the food price environment was generally favorable for us during 2009 we expect that there may be pricing pressures on some of our key ingredients during 2010 we could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to naturallyraised meats or other food items we buy as part of our food with integrity focus the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for commodity food products any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as beef chicken cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork would adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to suspend serving menu items such as guacamole rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales 

  

instances of foodborne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants or result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales and could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat or produce we use to prepare our food 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry which could adversely affect sales for instance during 2008 a small number of chipotle restaurants were associated with separate outbreaks of customer illness and even in markets in which we were never proven to be the cause of the illnesses our sales were adversely impacted if our customers become ill from foodborne or localized illnesses we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants would adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability 

in addition reports linking a nationwide outbreak of salmonella during the summer of 2008 to a variety of fresh produce items caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu similarly past outbreaks of e coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems other foodborne illnesses such as hepatitis a or norovirus and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse affect on the price and availability of affected ingredients if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like competition increased minimum wage requirements employee benefits and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees especially restaurant managers and crew members our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or require us to change our culture any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly 

various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws and the us congress and department of homeland security from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws regulations or enforcement programs as well some of these changes may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees in addition we have been subject to audits by immigration authorities from time to time although we require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees if a significant number of unauthorized workers is identified in a particular market or across our company the resulting disruption to our operations could be significant and our financial performance could be materially harmed as a result 

  

our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas 

some of our new restaurants are planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience for instance we expect to open a restaurant in london in the second quarter of 2010 which will be our first restaurant outside of north america and our second outside the united states and we are actively exploring expansion into france and germany as well new markets particularly outside the united states may have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as a result new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the chipotle brand and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture restaurants opened in new markets particularly outside the united states may also have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher construction occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets we may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall profitability some or all of these factors may be more pronounced in markets outside the united states due to cultural regulatory or economic differences with which we are not familiar which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could thereby adversely impact our overall results 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results or the brand identity that we have tried to create consumers may also be more pricesensitive during difficult economic times and we experienced some decrease in traffic during late 2008 and throughout 2009 that we attribute in part to menu price increases many forecasts predict continued economic difficulties throughout 2010 so our ability to increase sales may be significantly hampered for the foreseeable future 

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets and as we do so sales may decline in our previouslyopened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newlyopened restaurant instead 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover new companies may enter our markets and target our customers for example additional competitive pressures have come more recently from the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery 

  

store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

we are implementing a new marketing and branding strategy and the additional expense associated with this initiative may adversely impact our business 

during 2008 we announced plans to refocus our marketing and branding strategy in january 2009 we hired mark crumpacker as our first chief marketing officer to lead our efforts on this initiative and developed and introduced new logos and a new advertising approach and other branding elements in late 2009 and early 2010 we developed a new advertising and marketing strategy some components of which we are still working on we do not have any assurance that our latest marketing strategies will be successful if new advertising modified branding and other marketing programs do not drive increased restaurant sales the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect 

our food with integrity philosophy subjects us to risks 

our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to adhere to the principle of food with integrity we use a substantial amount of naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients and try to make our food as fresh as we can in light of pricing considerations we do however face challenges associated with pursuing food with integrity it can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers meeting our criteria and there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients the growth process for naturally raised meat and sustainably grown vegetables is longer herd losses can also be greater when animals are not treated with antibiotics and hormones given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area we expect shortages of naturallyraised chicken during the first half of 2010 due to a supplier suspending production furthermore as we increase our use of these ingredients the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained moreover we are broadening our commitment to serving local produce and produce purchased from farmers markets when seasonally available these initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent and present additional risk of foodborne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers quality variations and foodborne illness concerns could adversely impact public perceptions of food with integrity or our brand generally if as a result of any of these factors we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis or at all our food costs could increase adversely impacting our operating margins these factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with food with integrity which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations we have almost no longterm contracts with suppliers and we have relied largely on the same third party distribution network as mcdonald’s if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason our business 

  

financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our food with integrity suppliers and as described in more detail above these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them if we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels negative consumer sentiment in the wake of the economic downturn was widely reported in 2009 and according to some forecasts will continue during 2010 our sales may decline during this or future economic downturns which can be caused by various factors such as high gasoline prices declining home prices or tight credit markets any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain restaurant managers and crew we also are continuing to revise our field management structure in an effort to develop additional topperforming restaurant managers more quickly we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow however we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability and property damage we are selfinsured for our health plans and have purchased a fullyinsured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability and property damage insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is 

  

based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

the impact on us of continuing economic uncertainty may be exacerbated if our suppliers landlords and other counterparties are not able to continue to do business with us or are forced to alter the terms on which they do business with us 

some of our suppliers and other vendors have been adversely impacted by tightening of the credit markets decreased economic activity fluctuations in commodity prices and other consequences of ongoing economic difficulties some vendors have sought to change the terms on which they do business with us in order to lessen the impact of the economic environment on their business if we are forced to find alternative vendors for key services whether due to demands from the vendor or the vendor’s bankruptcy or ceasing operations that could be a distraction to us and adversely impact our business 

for example we are aware that the economic environment has forced some food suppliers to seek financing in order to stabilize their businesses and some suppliers have ceased operations completely additional suppliers may encounter difficulties in sustaining their business and if any of our major suppliers or a large number of other suppliers suspend or cease operations we may not be able to further our food with integrity initiative and may have difficulty keeping our restaurants fully supplied with the high quality ingredients we require if we were forced to suspend serving one or more of our menu items that could have a significant adverse impact on our restaurant traffic and public perceptions of us which would be harmful to our business 

similarly our restaurant expansion strategy relies in part on the development of new retail centers and similar projects many developers rely on the availability of financing to complete these types of projects and due to current conditions in the credit and commercial real estate markets financing may not be available on attractive terms or at all developers may also delay or cancel projects in light of uncertainty in the commercial real estate market or economic conditions generally if developers do not proceed with projects in which we plan to locate restaurants our expansion plans may be hampered which would adversely impact our growth and could impair our future profitability 

governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 

we are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons the expenses associated with these modifications could be material 

we are also subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees including wage and hour laws requirements to provide meal and rest periods or 

  

other benefits family leave mandates requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees citizenship or work authorization and related requirements insurance and workers’ compensation rules and antidiscrimination laws complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for noncompliance for example a lawsuit has been filed against us in california alleging violations of state laws regarding employee recordkeeping meal and rest breaks payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees we could suffer losses in this case or similar cases and any such losses could be significant in addition several states in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases and these increases could increase our labor costs we also are audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees 

the us congress has focused extensively on health care reform legislation over the past year and a comprehensive health care reform law is currently being crafted we cannot predict what new requirements we may be subject to as a result of any health care reform law that is ultimately enacted however new requirements to provide additional health insurance benefits to our employees would likely increase our expenses and any such increases could be large enough to materially impact our results of operations 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and a growing number of other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available we may in the future become subject to other initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food which could increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations we also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws 

we may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2009 slightly more than half of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers including us have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen in august 2004 the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data as a result we recorded losses and related expenses totaling 43 million from 2004 through 2006 

  

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating this could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

seasonal factors also cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our revenue will also vary as a result of the number of trading days that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall we believe the market price of our common stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results and as a result  if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from mcdonald’s could adversely affect us 

we understand that the exchange offer mcdonald’s completed in october 2006 to dispose of its interest in us was generally taxfree to mcdonald’s and its shareholders in order to protect the taxfree status of the exchange offer in the separation agreement we entered into with mcdonald’s in connection with the separation we agreed among other things to indemnify mcdonald’s for taxes and related losses it incurs as a result of the exchange failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction in certain situations if the taxes and related losses are attributable to i certain direct or indirect acquisitions of our stock or assets regardless of whether we consent to such acquisitions ii negotiations understandings agreements or arrangements in respect of such acquisitions or iii any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that affects the relative voting rights of any separate classes of our common stock in december 2009 following completion of an extensive due diligence process we completed a share conversion eliminating the existence of our class b common stock and with it the superior voting rights of the class b common stock in the event the share conversion is deemed to result in the mcdonald’s exchange offer failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction we may have an indemnification obligation under the provision described above we currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s could exceed 450 million and this estimate does not take into account related losses and depends upon several factors that are beyond our control as a consequence the indemnity to mcdonald’s could vary substantially from the estimate and may be much greater 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock any of these provisions as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with mcdonald’s described above under “restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of mcdonald’s exchange offer could adversely affect us” may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend a lawsuit has been filed against us in california alleging violations of state laws regarding employee recordkeeping meal and rest breaks payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees the case originally sought damages penalties and attorney’s fees on behalf of a purported class of our present and former employees the court denied the plaintiff’s motion to certify the purported class and as a result the action can proceed if at all as an action by a single plaintiff the plaintiff has appealed the court’s denial of class certification and the appeal remains pending although we have various defenses it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from this case 

we’re involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or capital resources however a significant increase in the number of these claims or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than we currently anticipate could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows

overview 

chipotle operates fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved today our vision is to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

2009 highlights and trends 

restaurant development  as of december 31 2009 we operated 956 restaurants in 35 states throughout the united states the district of columbia and ontario canada new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth we opened 121 restaurants in 2009 we expect to open between 120 and 130 restaurants in 2010 including one in london up to 25 of these openings will be what we are calling “a model” restaurants these restaurants will be located in well established markets with high levels of brand awareness a model locations will be built primarily in secondary trade areas which have attractive demographics but are typically characterized by lower occupancy costs we expect that a model locations will be constructed for substantially lower investment costs and have lower operating expenses than our recent traditional restaurant openings while the economic environment has put pressure on the commercial real estate market and developers reducing the number of new real estate developments available to us which have historically accounted for a majority of our new restaurants we expect that a model locations will allow us to pursue additional opportunities and continue to open 120130 restaurants next year 

sales growth our comparable restaurant sales increases were 22 in 2009 and were driven primarily by menu price increases partially offset by a decrease in customer visits and our average check not increasing by the full amount of the menu price increases we believe the decrease in customer visits and impact on our average check resulted primarily from the adverse macroeconomic environment as well as some customer reaction to our menu price increases late last year we generally increase our prices to be at or slightly below direct competitor pricing for comparable items comparable restaurant sales represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation 

we expect our comparable restaurant sales in 2010 to be flat as a result of this and normal inflationary pressures we anticipate our restaurant operating costs as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2010 

average restaurant sales were 1728 million as of december 31 2009 down from 1763 million as of december 31 2008 we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for companyoperated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months 

  

food with integrity in addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants we now serve naturally raised chicken in all of our restaurants and naturally raised beef in about 60 we define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet never given antibiotics or hormones and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded pens—which is more stringent than the usda’s recently adopted standard for naturally raised marketing claims the current economic conditions have led to natural chicken supply shortages as a result we have on occasion temporarily suspended serving naturally raised chicken in certain limited restaurants for short periods of time we expect additional shortages during the first half of 2010 due to a supplier suspending production of naturally raised chickens in 2009 35 of all beans we bought were organically grown and we have increased the percentage to 40 for 2010 also during 2009 we exceeded our goal to purchase at least 35 of at least one produce item while in season for each of our markets from small and midsize local farmers we expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2010 at the end of 2009 30 of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage during 2010 

marketing while our marketing approach has often been considered edgy and innovative we recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture in january 2009 we hired our first chief marketing officer and we continue to review our marketing strategy and messaging approach to make it more effective one component of that effort is to develop our advertising so that it more effectively communicates how chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts and so that it resonates more with our customers in addition we began testing an expanded menu in the denver market that is designed to broaden the appeal of our restaurants to families and to customers who are unfamiliar with chipotle or are seeking lowerpriced eating options but still value highquality ingredients and great taste based on the results thus far we’ve expanded the kid’s meal portion of the expanded menu to a total of 7 markets and expect the kid’s menu to be rolled out nationwide in 2010 

stock repurchases in september 2008 our board of directors approved the expenditure of up to 100 million to repurchase shares of our class b common stock and we repurchased shares in each month thereafter through august 2009 when the authorized repurchases were completed in november 2009 we announced that our board of directors approved the expenditure of up to an additional 100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b51 authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time subject to market conditions the repurchase agreement and the board’s authorization of the repurchase program may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time we repurchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of 841 million in the year ended december 31 2009 

cash and securities as of december 31 2009 we had cash and securities of 2696 million given the recent financial turmoil we have focused on capital preservation and our cash equivalent holdings consist of highlyrated money market funds or fdic insured accounts 

stock conversion in december 2009 our shareholders approved a proposal to convert all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock to shares of class a common stock on a oneforone basis and to rename the class a common stock as “common stock” the conversion was completed on december 21 2009 

  

restaurant openings relocations and closures 

the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated all restaurants were companyowned at the end of 2007 

 

 results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as our business grows as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs increase 

restaurant sales 

 

 the significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to 1617 million of the increase in sales in 2009 of which 736 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year in 2008 restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to 1823 million of the increase in sales of which 933 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2008 

comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to 263 million and 626 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2009 and 2008 respectively primarily driven by the impact of menu price increases initiated beginning in late 2008 in 2009 the impact of the menu price increases was partially offset by a decrease in customer visits and the average check not increasing by the full amount of the menu price increases 

food beverage and packaging costs 

 

   

food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 due primarily to the impact of menu price increases 

in 2008 food costs increased as a percentage of revenue due to increased product cost primarily cheese chicken and avocados partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets we saw significantly higher costs for many of our raw ingredients in 2008 

labor costs 

 

 labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases and labor efficiencies partially offset by increased average wage rates and lower transaction volumes 

in 2008 labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased due to the impact of menu price increases in selected markets partially offset by increased average wage rates and labor inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings 

occupancy costs 

 

 occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 primarily due to higher average rents for new locations as we continue to open proportionately more restaurants in more expensive areas than we have historically 

in 2008 occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to higher average rents for new locations as we opened proportionately more restaurants in expensive areas in 2008 than we have historically and a onetime 26 million noncash correction of our historical straightline rent expense the increase was partially offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base 

other operating costs 

 

 other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases and decreased marketing and promotional expenditures we expect an increase as a percentage of revenue in marketing and promotional spend in 2010 

in 2008 other operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to increased utilities repair and maintenance costs and credit card processing fees resulting from a higher percentage of our customers using credit cards the increase was partially offset by lower marketing and promotional expenditures 

  

general and administrative expenses 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2009 primarily resulted from an increase in performance related bonus accruals an increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from the stockbased compensation awards granted in 2009 wage inflation and hiring more employees as we grew this increase was partially offset by careful management of expenses primarily travel costs as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses decreased in 2009 due primarily to the impact of menu price increases and lower travel costs partially offset by increased performance related bonus accruals and stockbased compensation 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2008 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew an increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from the stockbased compensation awards granted in 2008 and the cost of an all manager conference held in the third quarter this increase was partially offset by lower performance related bonus accruals as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses decreased in 2008 due primarily to menu price increases and lower performance related bonus accruals 

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to largely remain consistent in 2010 which takes into consideration that we will have materially higher stock compensation expense than 2009 and approximately 3 million in costs associated with an all manager conference to be held during 2010 

depreciation and amortization 

 

 depreciation and amortization increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to the increase in the number of restaurants from january 1 2007 to december 31 2009 

as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization remained constant 

preopening costs 

 

 preopening costs decreased in 2009 as a result of a decrease in the number of restaurants opened and under construction in 2009 partially offset by an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period due to higher rents for more expensive locations 

  

preopening costs increased in 2008 primarily due to an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period and an increase in the number of restaurants opened preopening costs include noncash straightline rent expense of 44 million 59 million and 46 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

loss on disposal of assets 

 

 loss on disposal of assets decreased in 2009 as a result of decreases in the number of remodels and in writeoffs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected and also as a result of our not recording any restaurant impairment charges 

the increase in 2008 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants and updating older restaurants in certain markets an increase in writeoffs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected and an impairment charge related to a restaurant closure 

interest and other income 

 

 interest and other income decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower yields on our investments these decreases are partially offset by a higher average cash balance and fewer taxexempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes 

income tax provision 

 

 the 2009 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a onetime benefit for prior period meals and entertainment deductions and 2008 federal tax return adjustments a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate and an increase in deductions for food donations partially offset by a reduction in earnings on taxexempt investments 

the 2008 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a reduction in earnings on taxexempt investments partially offset by a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate 

  

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2009 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

 

  

 seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results overall on an annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs we have a cash and shortterm investment balance of 2696 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to repurchase up to an additional 859 million of our common stock subject to market conditions to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes we believe that cash from operations together with our cash balance will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

  

in february 2009 we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america na with an initial principal amount of 25 million and an additional 25 million accordion feature borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate set at our option at either i an adjusted libor rate plus a margin ranging from 075 to 20 depending on a leaseadjusted leverage ratio or ii a daily rate equal to a the highest of the federal funds rate plus 05 the bank’s published prime rate and onemonth libor plus 10 plus b a margin ranging from 00 to 10 depending on a leaseadjusted leverage ratio the facility includes a commitment fee on the unused balance ranging from 025 to 05 based on the leaseadjusted leverage ratio availability of borrowings under the facility is conditioned on our compliance with specified covenants including a maximum leaseadjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2009 the facility expires in february 2014 but can be terminated or decreased at our option prior to expiration we intend to use the credit facility for letters of credit issued in the normal course of business and normal shortterm working capital needs as of december 31 2009 there were no loans outstanding and available borrowings were 197 million 

while operations continue to provide cash our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development our total capital expenditures for 2009 were 1172 million and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 115 million in 2010 of which 100 million relates to our construction of new restaurants and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments in 2009 we spent on average about 850000 in development and construction costs per restaurant net of landlord reimbursements the average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from 916000 in 2008 due to cost savings realized in part from certain cost reduction efforts associated with the development of the a model strategy in 2010 we expect average development and construction costs to be approximately 800000 as we begin to open a model restaurants 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

  

 we’re obligated under noncancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

  

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor fuel utility costs materials used in the construction of our restaurants and insurance although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs additionally many of our leases require us to pay taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease most of our restaurant locations our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumptions were derived from our actual and implied volatilities and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options and stock appreciation rights our stockbased compensation expense and result of operations could have been different 

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health workers’ compensation general liability and property damage pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated which would result in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 

  

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2009 and 2008 once resolved however these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows 

sabbatical liability 

we offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete we record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense 

unredeemed gift card balances 

we sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date and from which we do not deduct nonusage fees we recognize revenue from gift cards when i the gift card is redeemed by the customer or ii the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction the determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a period of six months beginning at the date of the gift card sale we have determined 5 of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by us any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend changing interest rates 

we’re exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2009 we had 2363 million deposited in shortterm investments and availableforsale securities and 308 million in fdic insured accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 038 approximately 040 tax equivalent 

commodity price risks 

we are also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices however a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient in several cases we have minimum purchase obligations we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons

 item 1 business tableend general 

chipotle mexican grill inc “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operates 837 restaurants in 33 states throughout the united states the district of columbia and toronto canada as of december 31 2008 our restaurants serve a focused menu of tacos burritos salads and burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla made using fresh ingredients people outside our company tend to categorize us as a “fast casual” concept—restaurants that are a step up from traditional fast food but not casual sitdown places we’ve never worried much about what category we’re in instead we remain focused on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on recruiting and retaining top performing people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is exceptional and on building restaurants that are operationally efficient aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment 

chipotle began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved today our vision is to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

we manage our operations and restaurants based on five regions that all report into a single segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 and our total assets as of december 31 2008 and 2007 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our predecessor corporation world foods inc was founded in colorado in 1993 mcdonald’s corporation made an equity investment in us in february 1998 becoming our majority shareholder and simultaneous with mcdonald’s initial investment in us world foods inc merged with chipotle mexican grill inc a newlyformed delaware corporation we completed our initial public offering of class a common stock in january 2006 mcdonald’s sold a portion of its interest in us in the initial public offering sold an additional portion of its interest in us in a secondary offering of class a common stock in may 2006 and disposed of its remaining interest in us in an exchange offer to its shareholders that was completed in october 2006 as a result of the completion of the mcdonald’s exchange offer we now have two publiclytraded classes of common stock class a and class b and mcdonald’s no longer owns any interest in us 

our menu and food preparation 

a few things thousands of ways we serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices we plan to keep a focused menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense and if you can’t find something on the menu that’s quite what you’re after let us know if we can make it from the ingredients we have we’ll do it 

in preparing our food we use gas stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods 

  

such as rice ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef and pinto and vegetarian black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt in addition to sodas and fruit drinks most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas all of our food is prepared from scratch with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in commissaries with the exception of the sweet corn for one of our salsas our ingredients are never frozen 

food served fast … so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that have prepared the food while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a “fastfood” experience even when they’re not in a hurry and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we’re focused on further improving the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic for instance our restaurants accept orders over the internet or by fax in order to allow customers in a hurry or with large orders to avoid standing in line to wait for their food we have installed change machines at the cashier station in virtually all of our restaurants and have implemented a handheld pointofsale terminal in a small number of our restaurants which allows customers to pay with a credit card while waiting in line we continue to review other equipment and kitchen design modifications to improve the speed of service by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our restaurants to keep pace at even our highestvolume restaurants we believe that we can provide the chipotle experience to more and more customers 

“food with integrity” more than anything serving high quality food is what motivates us and we’re always looking to make the food we serve better as part of our “food with integrity” strategy we believe that using fresh ingredients is not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our ingredients come from and how the animals are raised this includes working with experts in the areas of animal ethics to try to support more humane farming practices because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on where we obtain each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food all of our pork and all of our chicken in the us for example is naturally raised we define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet never given antibiotics or hormones and raised in open pastures or deeply bedded pens—which is more stringent than the usda’s new standard for naturally raised marketing claims we also serve naturally raised beef in about 60 of our restaurants we’re also investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees while still charging reasonable prices for our food today about 35 of all of the beans we buy are organically grown—that is they meet us food and drug administration standards for “organic” up from 30 during 2008 all of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh or recombinant bovine growth hormone to stimulate milk production by the end of 2008 10 of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage significantly during 2009 during 2008 we purchased at least 25 of at least one produce item while in season in each of our markets from small to midsize local farmers 

we do however face challenges in pursuing our ‘food with integrity’ strategy including the length of time it takes to identify and secure relationships with suppliers and the costs and risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients naturally raised meat and sustainably grown vegetables are more costly and the growth process is longer herd losses can also be greater when animals are not treated with 

  

antibiotics and hormones given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area we believe that consumers’ increasing concern about where and how food is raised and about the environmental management animal husbandry and labor practices of food suppliers will continue to foster demand for these foods over the longterm we believe that increased demand for naturally raised meat and produce over the longterm will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers we also understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing “food with integrity” with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if our focus continues to resonate with consumers it should improve our sourcing flexibility over time though we expect that these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than commoditypriced equivalents for some time to come 

quality assurance and food safety chipotle is committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs including farm supplier and distributor audits our training department develops and implements operating standards for food quality preparation cleanliness and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable state and local food safety regulations although chipotle was never directly related to the outbreak during 2008 we responded to a nationwide outbreak of salmonella potentially linked to a variety of fresh produce items by temporarily suspending serving some items and cooking the jalapenos that are used in some of our fresh salsas and guacamole 

restaurant management and operations 

culture of high performers we value the individuality of our company our employees and our customers which we believe results in a management operations and training philosophy distinct from that of our competitors we are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our customers the foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best teams in our restaurants we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards but that allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower others we provide hands on shoulder to shoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees through our culture diversity and language programs that we provide in all of our markets we teach english to spanishspeaking workers which helps our crew provide better customer service and provides greater career opportunities this program helps encourage our staff members to develop skills that will enhance their work experience and enrich their personal lives our best restaurant managers who run great restaurants and develop strong restaurant teams are promoted to restaurateur and can earn bonuses for developing people and building sales we’ve leveraged our outstanding restaurateurs’ leadership by giving select restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring nearby restaurants this provides an opportunity for restaurateurs to develop in field leadership roles one restaurant at a time 

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques frozen meats and microwaves used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats handchop produce and herbs make fresh salsa and guacamole and steam rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a typical fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants 

  

the front line is key our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to have genuine interactions with customers no matter their job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer “one entree at a time” we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among restaurant managers crew members and customers alike 

the basics each restaurant typically has a restaurant manager a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an assistant manager one or two hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of approximately 17 to 20 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people greater variety and the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our restaurant managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day and although they may increase our labor costs we believe that the benefits we provide to our employees which include language training and a company car program for qualified restaurant managers help us to attract and keep top performing restaurant managers and crew members 

in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes team leaders area managers operations directors and regional directors for 2009 we are updating the field support structure to ensure it is effective and efficient as we grow and to ensure we have provided a great career path at chipotle–not only from crew to manager but also from manager to a field leadership role 

provisions and supplies 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high quality levels we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers we purchase from various suppliers carefully selected based on quality and their understanding of our brand and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues weather exchange rates foreign demand crises and other world events that may affect supply prices 

we do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers but have approved all of the suppliers from whom ingredients are purchased for our restaurants distribution centers purchase ingredients and other supplies from suppliers we select based on our quality specifications and purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers 

distribution arrangements we deliver ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants from 21 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers as we continue to expand geographically we expect to add additional regional distribution centers 

marketing 

our marketing has historically been based on the belief that the best and most recognizable brands aren’t built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone but also through deeply held beliefs that are evident in how the company is run all of the ways that we project ourselves—beginning with each customer’s experience in our restaurants the look and feel of our restaurants our advertising and promotional programs and the design items that carry our name or logo—influence how people think about us 

  

when we open a new restaurant we plan a range of activities to introduce chipotle to the local community and to create interest in the restaurant from the start our advertising has generally included print outdoor transit and radio ads in addition we continue to generate considerable media coverage with scores of publications writing favorably about our food restaurant concept and business and our food and restaurants have been featured in a number of television news programs 

collectively these efforts have helped us create considerable wordofmouth publicity with our customers learning about us and telling others allowing us to build awareness with relatively low advertising expenditures 

we also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture to help us improve our marketing direction and message to deepen our relationships with customers and continue to attract new customers we hired our first ever chief marketing officer in january 2009 shortly after filling this new position we hired a new advertising agency and are taking a fresh look at our marketing strategy and direction with an eye to making our marketing more effective as part of these efforts we have developed and introduced in select markets new logos and other branding 

competition 

the fastcasual segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented in addition fastcasual restaurants compete against other segments of the restaurant industry including quickservice restaurants and casual dining restaurants the number size and strength of competitors vary by region market and even restaurant all of these restaurants compete based on a number of factors including taste quality speed of service value name recognition restaurant location customer service and the ambience and condition of each restaurant 

we compete with national and regional fastcasual quickservice and casual dining restaurants our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and inrestaurant cafés of several major grocery store chains many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources have been in business longer and have greater name recognition than we have and are better established than we are in the markets where our restaurants are located or are planned to be located 

we believe we’re wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends including the increasing impact of hispanic culture on food the growth of the mexican food segment and increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared some of our competitors have formats similar to ours we believe however that chipotle has become one of the most recognized fastcasual restaurants and is known for its focus on preparing food using a variety of fresh ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food and commitment to “food with integrity” which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year

we also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress from time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks restaurant designs or advertising although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 

information systems 

chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office this system includes a pointofsales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant additionally the pointofsales system is used to authorize batch and transmit credit card transactions to record employee time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis which enables management to continually monitor operating results we believe that our current pointofsales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we had about 20400 employees including 2090 salaried employees and 18310 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

this report includes statements of our expectations intentions plans and beliefs that constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections these statements which involve risks and uncertainties relate to the discussion of our business strategies and our expectations concerning future operations margins profitability liquidity and capital resources and to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable forwardlooking statements include our estimates of the amount of certain expected expenses for 2009 projections of the number of restaurants we expect to open in 2009 and potential changes in our comparable restaurant sales during 2009 statements of our intention to open restaurants in one or more specified particular locations and statements regarding the potential impact of the current economic downturn on our business we have used words such as “may” “will” “should” “expect” “intend” “plan” “anticipate” “believe” “think” “estimate” “seek” “expect” “predict” “could” “project” “potential” and other 

  

similar terms and phrases including references to assumptions in this report to identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties risks and factors relating to our operations and business environments all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements such risks and other factors include those listed in this item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

when considering these forwardlooking statements you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and the documents incorporated by reference new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time and we cannot predict those events or how they may affect us we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information future events or developments except as required by applicable laws and regulations 

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants and is subject to many unpredictable factors 

there were 837 chipotle restaurants as of december 31 2008 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years and plan to open between 120 and 130 new restaurants in 2009 however we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 one of our biggest challenges is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for those sites in our target markets can be intense and development and leasing costs are increasing particularly for urban locations delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results moreover as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline which may in turn slow our profitability growth 

our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods similarly our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 

  

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales are less than we expect 

while future sales growth will depend substantially on our plans for new restaurant openings the level of comparable restaurant sales which represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated during 2008 and we do not expect comparable restaurant sales growth to continue at historical levels we expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2009 to be in the low single digits due to the impact of weaker consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn potential traffic declines as a result of our recent menu price increases and difficult prioryear comparisons if the economy remains weak or further weakens we may lower our expectations for comparable restaurant sales in addition our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends in part on our ability to successfully implement a new marketing and branding strategy our initiative to increase the speed at which our crew serves each customer and expanded use of fax service lines and online ordering each of which we may not be able to accomplish as a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales growth or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative if this were to happen sales and profit growth would be adversely affected and our stock price would be likely to decline 

new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and the increases in average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area higher fixed costs relating to increased occupancy costs and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable in addition our average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales likely will not continue to increase at the rates achieved over the past several years and may decline particularly due to the current economic downturn our ability to operate new restaurants profitably and increase average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales will depend on many factors some of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to open restaurants as quickly as planned or if new restaurants do not perform as planned our business and future prospects could be harmed in addition changes in our average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales could cause our operating results to vary adversely from expectations which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

  

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain restaurant managers and crew we also are restructuring our field management structure in part due to our recent rapid growth we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow however we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases fluctuations of the us dollar product recalls and government regulations the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and oil increased over the past year this has resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice and although some prices eased somewhat near the end of 2008 we expect pricing pressures to generally continue in 2009 we have also had a significant increase in the cost of rice soy oil and sweet corn as a result of the renewal of pricing protocols for those items at the end of the third quarter of 2008 any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as beef chicken cheese avocados beans rice tomatoes and pork could adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to suspend serving menu items such as guacamole rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales 

instances of foodborne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants and result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales or could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat or produce we use to prepare our food 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry which could adversely affect sales for instance during 2008 a small number of chipotle restaurants were associated with separate outbreaks of customer illness and even in markets in which we were never proven to be the cause of the illnesses our sales were adversely impacted if our customers become ill from foodborne or localized illnesses we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants could materially harm our business 

in addition reports linking a nationwide outbreak of salmonella during the summer of 2008 to a variety of fresh produce items caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu similarly past outbreaks of e coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains asian and european countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems other foodborne illnesses such as hepatitis a or trichinosis and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past and could have in the future an adverse affect on the price and availability of affected ingredients if we 

  

react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of foodborne illnesses which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like competition increased minimum wage requirements employee benefits and changes due to our new restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees especially restaurant managers and crew members our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or require us to change our culture any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly 

various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws and the us congress has recently been considering changes to federal immigration laws as well some of these new laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees although we require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand 

the impact of the current economic downturn on us may be exacerbated if our suppliers landlords and other counterparties are not able to continue to do business with us or are forced to alter the terms on which they do business with us 

some of our suppliers and other vendors have been adversely impacted by tightening of the credit markets decreased economic activity fluctuations in commodity prices and other consequences of the economic downturn some vendors have sought to change the terms on which they do business with us in order to lessen the impact of the economic downturn on their business if we are forced to find alternative vendors for key services whether due to demands from the vendor or the vendor’s bankruptcy or ceasing operations that could be a distraction to us and adversely impact our business 

for example we are aware that the economic environment has forced some food suppliers to seek financing in order to stabilize their businesses and some suppliers have ceased operations completely additional suppliers may encounter difficulties in sustaining their business and if any of our major suppliers or a large number of other suppliers suspend or cease operations we may not be able to further our “food with integrity” initiative and may have difficulty keeping our restaurants fully supplied with the high quality ingredients we require if we were forced to suspend serving one or more of our menu items that could have a significant adverse impact on our restaurant traffic and public perceptions of us which would be harmful to our business 

similarly our restaurant expansion strategy relies in part on the development of new retail centers and similar projects many developers rely on the availability of financing to complete these types of projects and due to the current volatility in the credit markets financing may not be available on attractive terms or at all 

  

developers may also delay or cancel projects in light of uncertainty in the commercial leasing market or economic conditions generally if developers do not proceed with projects in which we plan to locate restaurants our expansion plans may be hampered which would adversely impact our growth and future profitability 

our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas 

some of our new restaurants are planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience for instance we have announced plans to open a restaurant in london in 2009 which will be our first restaurant outside of north america and our second outside the united states new markets particularly outside the united states may have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as a result new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the chipotle brand and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture restaurants opened in new markets may also have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher construction occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets we may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall profitability some or all of these factors may be more pronounced in markets outside the united states due to cultural regulatory or economic differences with which we are not familiar which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could thereby adversely impact our overall results 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results or the brand identity that we have tried to create consumers may also be more pricesensitive during difficult economic times and we experienced some decrease in traffic during late 2008 that we attribute in part to menu price increases many forecasts predict continued economic difficulties throughout 2009 so our ability to increase sales may be significantly hampered for the foreseeable future 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories sodium carbohydrates or fat these changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels negative consumer sentiment in the wake of the economic downturn has been widely reported in 2008 and early 2009 our sales may decline during this or future economic downturns which can be caused by various factors such as high gasoline prices or during periods of uncertainty such as those that followed the terrorist attacks on the united states in 2001 any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

  

competition could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and often have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally as we expand further in existing markets our existing restaurants may face competition from our new restaurants that begin operating in those markets 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not currently pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover new companies may enter our markets and target our customers for example additional competitive pressures have come more recently from the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

in addition our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets as we open more restaurants in an existing market sales may decline in some existing restaurants as customers who frequent one of our established restaurants may begin to visit one of our new restaurants instead 

any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability and property damage in conjunction with our separation from mcdonald’s we entered into certain new insurance policies with modified coverage prior to entering into the new policies we were covered by fixed cost policies for health insurance and worker’s compensation we are now selfinsured for our health plans and have purchased a fullyinsured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability and property damage insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

  

we may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 

we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants during 2008 approximately half of our sales were attributable to credit card transactions and credit card usage could continue to increase a number of retailers including us have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen in august 2004 the merchant bank that processed our credit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of credit and debit card data as a result we recorded losses and related expenses totaling 43 million from 2004 through 2006 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers we do not have longterm contracts with any of our suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather a supplier ceasing operations or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients including beef pork chicken beans rice sour cream and tortillas due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our “food with intergrity” suppliers these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them in addition we have relied on the same third party distribution network as mcdonald’s we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers with pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter if our customers change their dining habits as a result our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

in addition our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to adhere to the principle of “food with integrity” we use a substantial amount of naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients and try to make our food as fresh as we can in light of pricing considerations as we increase our use of these ingredients the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained our inability to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis or at all could cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with the principle of “food with integrity” that could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline 

governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 

we are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other 

  

agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons the expenses associated with these modifications could be material 

our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions along with the us americans with disabilities act family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters a lawsuit has been filed against us in california alleging violations of state laws regarding employee recordkeeping meal and rest breaks payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees we could suffer losses in this case or similar cases and any such losses could be significant in addition several states in which we operate and the federal government have recently enacted minimum wage increases and these increases could increase our labor costs 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the state of california new york city and other jurisdictions around the us have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available we may in the future become subject to other initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food which could increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput these initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants many environmental laws applicable to us provide for significant fines penalties and liabilities sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or actual or alleged exposure to such substances we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner and operator to address any remaining contamination any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations 

we are implementing a new marketing and branding strategy and the additional expense associated with this initiative may adversely impact our business 

during 2008 we announced plans to refocus our marketing and branding strategy in january 2009 we hired mark crumpacker as our first chief marketing officer to lead our efforts on this initiative and also retained a 

  

new outside advertising agency in addition we have developed and introduced in select markets new logos and other branding we are still developing many facets of our new marketing and branding strategy and do not have any assurance that our new strategy will be successful if new advertising modified branding and other marketing programs do not drive increased restaurant sales the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 seasonal factors also cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our revenue will also vary as a result of the number of trading days that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

  

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock prices to fall we believe the market prices of our class a and class b common stock reflect high market expectations for our future operating results and as a result  if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

the prices of our class a and class b common stock may continue to differ 

our class b common stock has historically traded at lower prices than our class a common stock for instance on february 13 2009 our class a common stock closed at 5505 per share and our class b common stock closed at 5117 per share the trading prices of our class a and class b common stock may continue to differ due to factors outside of our control including differences in market awareness of the two classes trading liquidity of the two classes or other factors in the separation agreement we entered into with mcdonald’s in connection with our separation from them we agreed not to take any action to combine the class a and class b common stock or otherwise eliminate the twoclass capital structure until at least the fifth anniversary of the separation unless we obtain mcdonald’s consent or mcdonald’s at our request obtains a ruling from the irs or we obtain an opinion of counsel satisfactory to mcdonald’s that such action will not adversely impact the taxfree nature of our separation from mcdonald’s obtaining such a ruling or opinion involves complex tax laws and factspecific determinations and there may be significant obstacles to our obtaining either a ruling or an opinion satisfying the requirements of the separation agreement determining whether a ruling or opinion is available will involve significant costs moreover even if we propose to combine the class a and class b common stock or otherwise eliminate the twoclass structure we cannot anticipate how the prices of the class a and class b common stock may react to such an action we may incur a large indemnity obligation to mcdonald’s if the exchange offer through which we separated from mcdonald’s is determined to be taxable as a result of our breach of the separation agreement or any action we take to combine the class a and class b common stock or otherwise eliminate the twoclass structure see “restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of mcdonald’s exchange offer could adversely affect us” below 

restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from mcdonald’s could adversely affect us 

we understand that the exchange offer mcdonald’s completed in october 2006 to dispose of its interest in us should generally be taxfree to mcdonald’s and its shareholders current us tax law generally creates a presumption that a taxfree exchange of the type used by mcdonald’s would be taxable to mcdonald’s but not to its shareholders if we or our shareholders were to engage in a transaction that would result in a 50 or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the fouryear period beginning two years before the date of the exchange unless it is established that the exchange and the transaction are not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership as a consequence of the foregoing in the separation agreement we entered into with mcdonald’s in connection with the separation we agreed among other things 

 

  

   

the indemnity described above covers corporate level taxes and related losses suffered by mcdonald’s in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership as well as taxes and related losses suffered by mcdonald’s if due to any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated the exchange is determined to be taxable for other reasons we currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s for taxes due in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership could exceed 450 million this estimate which does not take into account related losses depends upon several factors that are beyond our control as a consequence the indemnity to mcdonald’s could vary substantially from the estimate furthermore the estimate does not address the potential indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s in the event that due to any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated the exchange is determined to be taxable for other reasons in that event the total indemnification could extend to taxrelated losses suffered by mcdonald’s shareholders and therefore would likely be much greater 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our class a or class b common stock our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding class a or class b common stock any of these provisions as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with mcdonald’s described above under “restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of mcdonald’s exchange offer could adversely affect us” may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

overview 

chipotle operates fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved today our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

2008 highlights and trends 

restaurant development  as of december 31 2008 we operated 837 restaurants in 33 states throughout the united states the district of columbia and toronto canada new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth we opened 136 restaurants in 2008 we expect to open between 120 and 130 restaurants in 2009 including one in london 

sales growth in addition to growing our number of restaurants we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales from 1734 million as of december 31 2007 to 1763 million as of december 31 2008 driven by comparable restaurant sales increases our comparable restaurant sales increases were 58 in 2008 and 108 in 2007 comparable restaurant sales increases in 2008 were due mainly to menu price increases our comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated during 2008 which we believe was due primarily to the weakened economy we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for companyoperated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months comparable restaurant sales include companyoperated restaurants only and represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation 

we expect our comparable restaurant sales increases in 2009 to be in the low single digits driven primarily by menu price increases implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008 partially or fully offset by a decrease in customer visits due to fluctuations in consumer spending as a result of economic uncertainty potential traffic declines as a result of our recent menu price increases and variability in prioryear comparisons we could experience rapid and large changes in our comparable restaurant sales trends during the year 

food costs the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and oil increased over 2007 prices this resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice in addition freezes during 2007 in california and chile put pricing pressure on avocados during 2008 we experienced a significant increase in cheese prices throughout 2008 as a result of the expiration of the pricing protocols under which we operated during 2007 we also experienced significant increases in the cost of rice soy oil and sweet corn in conjunction with the renewal of those pricing protocols at the end of the third quarter of 2008 in response to the increasing raw ingredient prices we instituted menu price increases in the fourth quarter of 2008 for most of the country this increase combined with some easing of commodity costs will likely result in flat food costs as a percentage of revenue for 2009 

  

labor although we have not been directly impacted by recent minimum wage increases we experienced some upward pressure on our restaurant wages in 2008 and expect further pressure into 2009 as a result we do not expect to see improvements in our labor expense as a percentage of revenue into 2009 

in addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew our restaurant management structure is designed to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers and we emphasized the importance of hiring and developing great crew at our first all managers conference we held in august 

we continue to focus on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food we have sought to ensure that we have an effective and efficient field support system for restaurant managers that supports our efforts to identify people with potential develops crew into managers and ensures high operating standards of our restaurants in an effort to achieve this we continue to develop the restaurateur program which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers we have also been working to leverage our restaurateurs’ leadership by giving select restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring nearby restaurants this provides the opportunity for restaurateurs to develop into field leadership roles as well 

food with integrity in addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants we now serve naturally raised chicken in all of our restaurants in the united states and naturally raised beef in about 60 however current economic conditions have led to natural chicken supply shortages as a result we temporarily suspended serving naturally raised chicken in certain limited restaurants for a short period of time we define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet never given antibiotics or hormones and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded pens—which is more stringent than the usda’s new standard for naturally raised marketing claims in 2008 30 of all beans we bought were organically grown and we have increased the percentage to 35 for 2009 also during 2008 we purchased at least 25 of at least one produce item while in season for each of our markets from small and midsize local farmers we expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2009 at the end of 2008 10 of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage during 2009 

marketing while our marketing approach has often been considered edgy and innovative we recognize the need for our marketing to evolve much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture in january 2009 we hired our first chief marketing officer and a new advertising agency and we are taking a fresh look at our marketing strategy and direction with an eye to making our marketing more effective 

stock repurchase in september 2008 our board of directors approved the expenditure of up to 100 million to repurchase shares of our class b common stock of which we purchased 300 million in 2008 we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b51 authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of class b common stock from time to time subject to market conditions the repurchase agreement and the board’s authorization of the repurchase program may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

cash and securities as of december 31 2008 we had cash and securities of 1880 million given the recent financial turmoil we have focused on capital preservation and invested our cash and securities solely in us treasuries treasury backed funds and fdic insured accounts 

2008 accounting adjustments we completed an analysis of unredeemed electronic gift card liabilities and recognized 23 million in revenue as a onetime cumulative adjustment for the recognition of unused gift card balances 

we implemented lease management software to perform the calculation of straightline rent expense and deferred rent during the implementation we identified certain adjustments related to our historical straightline 

  

lease calculations which were not recognized in our 2005 and prior consolidated financial statements as a result we recognized an additional 26 million in occupancy costs in the current period to correct this misstatement 

see note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for additional disclosure on the accounting adjustments

the following table details restaurant unit data for our companyoperated and franchised locations for the years indicated 

 

 results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as our business grows as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs increase 

restaurant sales 

 

 the significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to 1823 million of the increase in sales in 2008 of which 933 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year in 2007 restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to 1672 million of the increase in sales of which 838 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2007 

comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to 626 million and 981 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2008 the substantial majority of our comparable restaurant 

  

sales growth was driven by menu price increases and in 2007 was due primarily to an increase in the number of transactions and menu price increases in certain markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken 

food beverage and packaging costs 

 

 food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 due to increased product cost primarily cheese chicken and avocados partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets we saw significantly higher costs for many of our raw ingredients in 2008 

in 2007 food costs increased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to increased product costs primarily avocados chicken and steak partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken and improvements in food controls 

labor costs 

 

 labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases partially offset by increased average wage rates and labor inefficiencies associated with the new restaurant openings 

in 2007 labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased due to more effective management of staffing improved efficiency as restaurant sales increased faster than the need to add labor and lower insurance claims benefiting us as we became selfinsured in the fourth quarter of 2006 the decrease was partially offset by an increase in average wage rates 

occupancy costs 

 

 occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 primarily due to higher average rents for new locations primarily due to our opening proportionately more restaurants in expensive urban areas in 2008 and a onetime 26 million noncash correction of our historical straightline rent expense the increase was partially offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base 

  

in 2007 occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base partially offset by higher rents for new locations 

other operating costs 

 

 other operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to increased utilities repair and maintenance costs and credit card processing fees resulting from a higher percentage of our customers using credit cards the increase was partially offset by lower marketing and promotional spend 

in 2007 other operating costs declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base and operating efficiencies that were realized as we grew we also realized a benefit in 2007 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires 

general and administrative expenses 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2008 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew an increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from the stockbased compensation awards granted in 2008 and the cost of the all manager conference held in the third quarter this increase was partially offset by lower performance related bonus accruals as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses decreased in 2008 due primarily to menu price increases and lower performance related bonus accruals 

the increase in general and administrative expense in 2007 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and stockbased compensation awards granted in 2007 the increase was partially offset by the reversal of the credit card contingency reserve in the second quarter of 2007 and the impact of costs incurred for the exchange offer conducted by mcdonald’s in the third quarter of 2006 a secondary offering of our common stock in the second quarter of 2006 and severance costs incurred in the first and second quarters of 2006 as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses decreased in 2007 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base the reversal of the credit card contingency in 2007 and the costs incurred for the secondary and exchange offers and severance negatively impacting 2006 

depreciation and amortization 

 

   

depreciation and amortization increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to the increase in the number of restaurants from january 1 2006 to december 31 2008 

in 2008 as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization remained constant due to new store openings increasing the average per store depreciable base offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base in 2007 as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

preopening costs 

 

 preopening costs increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period and an increase in the number of restaurants opened preopening costs include noncash straightline rent expense of 59 million 46 million and 27 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

loss on disposal of assets 

 

 loss on disposal of assets increased in 2008 as a result of an increase in both the age and number of restaurants and updating older restaurants in certain markets an increase in writeoffs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected and an impairment charge related to a pending closure of a restaurant 

the increase in 2007 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants the upgrade of restaurant security systems and an increase in the writeoffs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected 

interest income 

 

 in 2008 interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on our investments in addition late in the third quarter of 2008 we moved our investments into more secure but lower yielding us treasury funds this 

  

decrease is partially offset by a higher average cash balance and fewer taxexempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes in 2007 interest income decreased primarily due to an increase in investments in taxexempt securities 

income tax provision 

 

 the 2008 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a reduction in earnings on taxexempt investments partially offset by a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate 

the 2007 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to increased investments in taxexempt securities and a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate the improvement was partially offset by a 05 million tax effect from nondeductible costs associated with the secondary offering and splitoff transaction in 2006 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2008 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

 

  

 seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results overall on an annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of 

  

the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs we have a cash and shortterm investment balance of 1880 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to repurchase up to an additional 700 million of our class b common stock subject to market conditions to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes we believe that cash from operations together with our cash balance will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

in february 2009 we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america na with an initial principal amount of 25 million and an additional 25 million accordion feature borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate set at our option at either i a rate equal to an adjusted libor rate plus a margin ranging from 075 to 20 depending on a leaseadjusted leverage ratio or ii a daily rate equal to a the highest of the federal funds rate plus 05 the bank’s published prime rate and onemonth libor plus 10 plus b a margin ranging from 00 to 10 depending on a leaseadjusted leverage ratio the facility requires that we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance ranging from 025 to 05 based on the leaseadjusted leverage ratio availability of borrowings under the facility requires that we be in compliance with specified covenants including a maximum leaseadjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio the facility expires in february 2014 but can be terminated or decreased at our option prior to expiration we intend to use the credit facility if at all for letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and normal shortterm working capital needs 

while operations continue to provide cash our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development as we expand into more urban areas our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites our total capital expenditures for 2008 were 1521 million and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 140 million in 2009 of which 120 million relates to our construction of new restaurants and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments in 2008 we spent on average about 916000 in development and construction costs per restaurant with endcaps costing about 774000 inlines costing about 965000 freestanding costing about 12 million and urban costing about 16 million in each case reduced for landlord reimbursements the average development and construction costs per restaurant increased from 880000 in 2007 due to opening a larger portion of our restaurants in urban locations being partially offset by a decline in the percentage of freestanding restaurant openings and decreasing our average restaurant size in 2009 we expect average development and construction costs to remain about the same overall as 2008 

  

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 were as follows 

 

  

 we’re obligated under noncancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2008 and 2007 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor fuel insurance utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs additionally many of our leases require us to pay taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease most of our restaurant locations our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we account for our leases under fasb statement no 13 accounting for leases “fas 13” which requires rent to be recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

  

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates the volatility assumptions were derived primarily from historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us and our volatility while a public company had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options and stock appreciation rights our stockbased compensation expense and result of operations could have been different 

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health workers’ compensation general liability and property damage pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2008 and 2007 once resolved however these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows 

sabbatical liability 

we offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete we record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense 

unredeemed gift card balances 

the company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date and it does not deduct nonusage fees from outstanding gift card balances the company recognizes revenue from gift cards when i the gift card is redeemed by the customer or ii the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage and the company determines that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction the determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns gift card breakage will be recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used gift card breakage is included in total revenue in the consolidated statement of income any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods 

  

adoption of new accounting standards 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 157 fair value measurements “fas 157” fas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and expands disclosure about fair value measurements fas 157 applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value the adoption of fas 157 did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend changing interest rates 

we’re exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations our interest income decreased during 2008 due to a significant reduction in interest rates as of december 31 2008 we had 1882 million deposited in shortterm investments and availableforsale securities bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of 03 approximately 04 tax equivalent 

commodity price risks 

we are also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities exchange rates foreign demand weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices substantial portions of the dollar value of goods purchased by us are effectively at spot prices though we generally do not have longterm supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues exchange rates foreign demand weather crises and other world events that may affect supply prices increases in ingredient prices have and could continue to adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons 

counterparty risks 

some of our suppliers and other vendors have been adversely impacted by tightening of the credit markets fluctuations in commodity prices and other consequences of the economic downturn some vendors have sought to change the terms on which they do business with us in order to lessen the impact of the economic downturn on their business if we are forced to find alternative vendors for key services whether due to demands from the vendor or the vendor’s bankruptcy or ceasing operations that could be a distraction to us and adversely impact our business changing vendors could also result in our inability to obtain business terms as favorable to us as the terms on which we currently operate

 item 1 business tableend general 

chipotle mexican grill inc “chipotle” the “company” or “we” operates more than 700 restaurants in 33 states and the district of columbia as of december 31 2007 our restaurants serve a focused menu of tacos burritos salads and burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla made using fresh ingredients people outside our company tend to categorize us as a “fast casual” concept—restaurants that are a step up from traditional fast food but not casual sitdown places we’ve never worried much about what category we’re in instead we remain focused on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food on recruiting and retaining top performing people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is exceptional and on building restaurants that are operationally efficient esthetically pleasing and with increasing awareness and respect for the environment 

chipotle began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved our vision is to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we purchase highquality fresh and raw ingredients use classic cooking methods and we have a distinctive interior design where friendly people take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our strategy called “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

we are transitioning the management of our operations and restaurants from three regions to five regions that all report into a single segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 and our total assets as of december 31 2007 and 2006 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our predecessor corporation world foods inc was founded in colorado in 1993 mcdonald’s corporation made an equity investment in us in february 1998 becoming our majority shareholder and simultaneous with mcdonald’s initial investment in us world foods inc merged with chipotle mexican grill inc a newlyformed delaware corporation we completed our initial public offering of class a common stock in january 2006 mcdonald’s sold a portion of its interest in us in the initial public offering sold an additional portion of its interest in us in a secondary offering of class a common stock in may 2006 and disposed of its remaining interest in us in an exchange offer to its shareholders that was completed in october 2006 as a result of the completion of the mcdonald’s exchange offer we now have two publiclytraded classes of common stock class a and class b and mcdonald’s no longer owns any interest in us 

our menu and food preparation 

a few things thousands of ways we serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices we plan to keep a focused menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense for example in 2005 we rolled out a salad that uses the same ingredients as our burritos and tacos with the addition of chipotlehoney vinaigrette that we make in the restaurant daily and if you can’t find something on the menu that’s quite what you’re after let us know if we can make it from the ingredients we have we’ll do it 

in preparing our food we use gas stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods 

  

such as rice ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated in our restaurants carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef and pinto and vegetarian black beans we add our rice which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce tomatoes peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt in addition to sodas and fruit drinks most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas all of our food is prepared from scratch with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in commissaries 

food served fast so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that have prepared the food while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a “fastfood” experience even when they’re not in a hurry and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we’re focused on further improving the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic for instance our restaurants accept orders by fax or over the internet in order to allow customers in a hurry or with large orders to avoid standing in line to wait for their food we installed change machines at the cashier station in virtually all of our restaurants we’ve also began testing a handheld pointofsale terminal in a small number of our restaurants which allows customers to pay with a credit card while waiting in line we continue to review other equipment and kitchen design modifications to improve the speed of service by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our restaurants to keep pace at even our highestvolume restaurants we believe that we can provide the chipotle experience to more and more customers 

“food with integrity” more than anything serving high quality food is what motivates us and we’re always looking to make the food we serve better as part of our “food with integrity” strategy we believe that using fresh ingredients is not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our ingredients come from and how the animals are raised this includes working with experts in the areas of animal ethics to try to support more humane farming practices because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on where we obtain each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food all of our pork for example is naturally raised coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet never given antibiotics or hormones and raised in open pastures or deeply bedded barns we also serve naturally raised chicken in about 84 of our restaurants and naturally raised beef in about 53 of our restaurants we’re also investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees while still charging reasonable prices for our food today about 30 of all of the beans we buy are organically grown that is they meet us food and drug administration standards for “organic” up from 25 during 2007 all of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh or recombinant bovine growth hormone to stimulate milk production 

we do however face challenges in pursuing our food with integrity strategy including the length of time it takes to identify and secure relationships with suppliers and the costs and risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients naturally raised meat and sustainably grown vegetables are more costly and the growth process is longer herd losses can also be greater when animals aren’t treated with antibiotics and hormones given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area we believe that consumers’ increasing concern about where and how food is raised and in the environmental management animal husbandry and labor practices of food suppliers will foster demand for these foods we believe that increased demand for naturally 

  

raised meat and produce will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers that said we understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing “food with integrity” with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if our focus resonates with consumers it should improve our sourcing flexibility although we would expect that these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than commoditypriced equivalents for some time to come 

quality assurance and food safety chipotle is committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs including farm supplier and distributor audits our training department develops and implements operating standards for food quality preparation and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable state and local food safety regulations 

restaurant management and operations 

culture of high performers we value the individuality of our company our employees and our customers which we believe results in a management operations and training philosophy distinct from that of our competitors we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards but that allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower others we provide hands on shoulder to shoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees our best restaurant managers who run great restaurants and develop strong restaurant teams are promoted to restaurateur  and can earn bonuses for developing people and building sales through our culture diversity and language programs that we provide in all of our markets we teach english to spanishspeaking workers which helps our crew provide better customer service and provides greater career opportunities this program helps encourage our staff members to develop skills that will enhance their work experience and enrich their personal lives 

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats handchop produce and herbs make fresh salsa and guacamole and steam rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a typical fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants 

the front line is key our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to have genuine interactions with customers no matter their specific job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting and keeping people who can deliver that experience for each customer “one burrito at a time” we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among restaurant managers crew members and customers alike 

the basics each restaurant typically has a restaurant manager a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an assistant manager one or two hourly service managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of approximately 19 to 23 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have 

  

more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people greater variety and the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer service we encourage our restaurant managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day and although they may increase our labor costs we believe that the benefits we provide to our employees which include language training and our company car program for longerterm restaurant managers help us to attract and keep top performing restaurant managers and crew members 

in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have a field support system that includes area managers operations directors and regional directors we are reviewing the field support structure to ensure it is effective and efficient as we grow and are in the process of reorganizing from three regions to five 

provisions and supplies 

close relationships with suppliers maintaining the high quality levels we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers we purchase from various suppliers carefully selected based on quality and their understanding of our brand and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues weather crises and other world events that may affect supply prices 

we do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers but have approved all of the suppliers from whom ingredients are purchased for our restaurants distribution centers purchase ingredients and other supplies from suppliers we select based on our quality specifications within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established 

distribution arrangements we deliver ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants from 21 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers as we continue to expand geographically we expect to add additional regional distribution centers 

marketing 

we believe the best and most recognizable brands aren’t built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone but also through deeply held beliefs that are evident in how the company is run all of the ways that we project ourselves—beginning with each customer’s experience in our restaurants the look and feel of our restaurants our advertising and promotional programs and the design items that carry our name or logo—influence how people think about us by adhering to this principle we believe that chipotle is well on its way to becoming a highly recognized brand 

when we open a new restaurant we plan a range of activities to introduce chipotle to the local community to help create interest in the restaurant from the start our advertising primarily includes print outdoor transit and radio ads in addition we continue to generate considerable media coverage with scores of publications writing favorably about our food restaurant concept and business and our food and restaurants have been featured in a number of television news programs 

although our marketing program has many components we believe the single greatest contributor to our success has been wordofmouth with our customers learning about us and telling others some of our customers have gone so far as to develop websites about chipotle providing a way for chipotle customers to share their stories this kind of support helps promote our business without requiring additional advertising expenditures

the fastcasual segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented in addition fastcasual restaurants compete against other segments of the restaurant industry including quickservice restaurants and casual dining restaurants the number size and strength of competitors vary by region all of these restaurants compete based on a number of factors including taste quality speed of service value name recognition restaurant location customer service and the ambience and condition of each restaurant 

we compete with national and regional fastcasual quickservice and casual dining restaurants our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and inrestaurant cafés of several major grocery store chains many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources have been in business longer and have greater name recognition than we have and are better established than we are in the markets where our restaurants are located or are planned to be located 

we believe we’re wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends including the increasing impact of hispanic culture on food the growth of the mexican food segment and increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared some of our competitors have formats similar to ours we believe however that chipotle has become one of the most recognized fastcasual restaurants and is known for its focus on using a variety of fresh ingredients and commitment to “food with integrity” which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year 

our intellectual property and trademarks 

“chipotle” “chipotle mexican grill” “chipotle mexican grill in stylized font” “unburritable” “food with integrity” “fresh is not enough anymore” “the gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands” the chili pepper logo design the foil burrito design and the chipotle medallion design are us registered trademarks of chipotle we have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the us in addition to our us registrations we own the trademarks for “chipotle mexican grill” in australia brazil and mexico and for “chipotle” in australia and the european union among other countries we have filed trademark applications for “chipotle” and related marks in a number of additional countries including canada 

we also believe that the design of our restaurant is our proprietary trade dress from time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks restaurant designs or advertising although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

information systems 

chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office this system includes a pointofsales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the 

  

appropriate locations within the restaurant additionally the pointofsales system is used to authorize batch and transmit credit card transactions to record employee time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis which enables management to continually monitor operating results we believe that our current pointofsales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we had about 18800 employees including 1800 salaried employees and 17000 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

 item 1a risk factors tableend cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

this report includes statements of our expectations intentions plans and beliefs that constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections these statements which involve risks and uncertainties relate to the discussion of our business strategies and our expectations concerning future operations margins profitability liquidity and capital resources and to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable forwardlooking statements include our estimates of the amount of certain expected expenses for 2008 as well as the number of restaurants that we expect to open in 2008 and potential changes in our comparable restaurant sales during 2008 we have used words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “intends” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “thinks” “estimates” “seeks” “expects” “predicts” “could” “projects” “potential” and other similar terms and phrases including references to assumptions in this report to identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties risks and factors relating to our operations and business environments all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements these risks and other factors include those listed in this item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

when considering these forwardlooking statements you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and the documents incorporated by reference new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time and we cannot predict those events or how they may affect us we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information future events or developments except as required by the federal securities laws 

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants and is subject to many unpredictable factors 

there were 704 chipotle restaurants as of december 31 2007 we plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years we may not be able to open new restaurants as quickly as planned we have experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again delays or 

  

failures in opening new restaurants could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results as we operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline in addition one of our biggest challenges is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for those sites in our target markets is intense and lease costs are increasing particularly for urban locations our ability to open new restaurants also depends on other factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although we plan to open a total of between 130 and 140 restaurants in 2008 we may not be able to do so for the reasons described in this risk factor in addition our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods in addition this growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales are less than we expect 

while future sales growth will depend substantially on our plans for new restaurant openings the level of comparable restaurant sales which include companyoperated restaurants only and represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base while we do not expect comparable restaurant sales growth to continue at historical levels and expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2008 in the low to mid single digits due to difficult prior year comparisons and the potential impact of weaker consumer spending our plans do incorporate increases in comparable restaurant sales our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends in part on our ability to successfully implement our initiatives to increase the speed at which our crew serves each customer and expanded use of fax service lines and online ordering which we may not be able to do it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales growth or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative if this were to happen sales and profit growth would be adversely affected 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain restaurant managers and crew we also are restructuring our field management structure in part due to our recent rapid growth we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands 

  

that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow however we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results 

new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and the increases in average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area higher fixed costs relating to increased occupancy costs and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants new restaurants may neither be profitable nor have similar results as our existing restaurants in addition our average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales likely will not continue to increase at the rates achieved over the past several years our ability to operate new restaurants profitably and increase average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales will depend on many factors some of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to open restaurants as quickly as planned or if new restaurants do not perform as planned our business and future prospects could be harmed in addition changes in our average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales could cause our operating results to vary adversely from expectations which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas 

some of our new restaurants are planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience for instance we have announced plans to open a restaurant in toronto in 2008 which will be our first restaurant outside of the united states new markets may have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as a result new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the chipotle brand and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture restaurants opened in new markets may also have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher construction occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets we may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting 

  

our overall profitability some or all of these factors may be more pronounced in markets outside the united states due to cultural regulatory or economic differences with which we are not familiar which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could thereby adversely impact our overall results 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs like all restaurant companies we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases product recalls and government regulations due to increased demand for ethanol the cost of corn has increased substantially which has increased the cost of cornsourced ingredients as well as wheat soybeans and rice this has led to upward pricing pressures on many of our other raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice and we expect that pressure to continue throughout 2008 furthermore our pricing protocols for cheese expired at the end of 2007 which has resulted in pricing increases on cheese that we expect to continue throughout 2008 as a result of freezes in california and chile and potentially as a result of wildfires in california we expect price pressure on avocados to continue in 2008 as well any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as beef chicken cheese avocados beans tomatoes and pork could adversely affect our operating results alternatively in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to suspend serving menu items such as guacamole rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales 

additional instances of e coli avian flu “mad cow” disease or other foodborne illnesses could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat or produce we use to prepare our food cause the temporary closure of some restaurants and result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales 

in 2006 outbreaks of e coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains asian and european countries have also experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems other foodborne illnesses such as hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past and could in the future adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers as a result our sales may decline 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry which could adversely affect sales if we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable in addition we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of making these changes and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors if our customers become ill from foodborne illnesses we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants could materially harm our business 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like competition increased minimum wage requirements employee benefits and changes due to our new restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success 

  

also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees including especially restaurant managers and crew members our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or require us to change our culture any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly 

various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws and the us congress has recently been considering changes to federal immigration laws as well some of these new laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees although we require all workers to provide us with governmentspecified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility some of our employees may without our knowledge be unauthorized workers unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health worker’s compensation general liability and property damage in conjunction with our separation from mcdonald’s we entered into certain new insurance policies with modified coverage prior to entering into the new policies we were covered by fixed cost policies for health insurance and worker’s compensation we are now selfinsured for our health plans and have purchased a fullyinsured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for worker’s compensation general liability and property damage insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results or the brand identity that we have tried to create 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to health or dietary concerns including preferences regarding items such as calories carbohydrates fat or sodium these changes could result in consumers avoiding our burritos and other menu items in favor of other foods our 

  

success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels negative consumer sentiment in particular relating to difficulties in the housing and credit markets has been widely reported in late 2007 and early 2008 our sales may decline during economic downturns which can be caused by various economic factors such as high gasoline prices or during periods of uncertainty such as those that followed the terrorist attacks on the united states in 2001 any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

competition from other restaurant companies could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer and often have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally as we expand further in existing markets our existing restaurants may face competition from our new restaurants that begin operating in those markets 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover new companies may enter our markets and target our customers for example additional competitive pressures have come more recently from the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

all of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

we may have experienced a security breach with respect to certain customer credit and debit card data and we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 

in august 2004 the merchant bank that processes our credit and debit card transactions which we refer to as the acquiring bank informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of credit and debit card data together with two forensic auditing firms we investigated the alleged theft and reviewed our information systems and information security procedures we also reported the problem to federal law enforcement authorities and cooperated in their investigation while to date we have not discovered conclusive evidence that a theft occurred we identified some restaurant practices that may have made information systems at our restaurants vulnerable during periods before august 2004 as a result outside parties may have gained access to stored information it is possible that all of the cards we processed since we began accepting them in 1999 may have been vulnerable in the three months prior to being notified of the problem we processed between 13 million and 15 million credit and debit card charges each month 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of this matter as long as a credit or debit card is active fraudulent charges may be made using that card until the 

  

card’s expiration date we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings by various interested parties including banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators the statutes of limitation for pursuing some of these potential claims may extend for six years or more in some cases depending on the circumstances moreover the application of the law and the rules and procedures of the major card associations in these circumstances is generally untested any lawsuit or other proceeding will likely be complex costly and protracted which could in turn divert financial and management resources from execution of our business plan we have no way to predict the level of claims or the number or nature of proceedings that may be asserted against us nor can we quantify the costs that we may incur in connection with investigating responding to and defending any of them if we litigate these matters we may not be able to defend against penalties successfully the ultimate outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

despite the changes we have made to our information systems as a result of this matter we still need to periodically upgrade our software we rely on commercially available software and other technologies to provide security for processing and transmission of customer credit card data during 2007 and 2006 approximately half of our sales were attributable to credit card transactions and we expect credit card usage to increase our systems could be compromised in the future which could result in the misappropriation of customer information or the disruption of our systems either of those consequences could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business or subject us to additional liabilities 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers we do not have longterm contracts with any of our suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on multiple suppliers for our pork chicken and beef supplies due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our pork suppliers these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them in addition we have relied on the same third party distribution network as mcdonald’s we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers with pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter if our customers change their dining habits as a result our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

in addition our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to adhere to the principle of “food with integrity” we use a substantial amount of naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients and try to make our food as fresh as we can in light of pricing considerations as we increase our use of these ingredients the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained our inability to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis or at all could cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with the principle of “food with integrity” that could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline 

governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 

we are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other 

  

agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons the expenses associated with these modifications could be material 

our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions along with the us americans with disabilities act family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters a lawsuit has been filed against us in california alleging violations of state laws regarding employee recordkeeping meal and rest breaks payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees we could suffer losses in this case or similar cases and any such losses could be significant in addition several states in which we operate and the federal government have recently enacted minimum wage increases and these increases could increase our labor costs 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example new york city and king county washington have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards and make other nutritional information available on printed menus which must be plainly visible to consumers at the point of ordering we may in the future become subject to other initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food which could increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line decreasing our throughput 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants many environmental laws applicable to us provide for significant fines penalties and liabilities sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or actual or alleged exposure to such substances we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner and operator to address any remaining contamination any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service 

  

marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

we may face difficulties transitioning services mcdonald’s provided to us and entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or service providers 

prior to our separation from mcdonald’s in october 2006 we benefited from our relationship with mcdonald’s in a number of ways mcdonald’s provided us directly or through mcdonald’s own vendor relationships with a variety of services and benefits and we also benefited from our relationship with mcdonald’s when we bought supplies or distribution or other services for example mcdonald’s relationships helped us obtain beneficial pricing on some supplies and services and we have relied on some of the same thirdparty distribution networks as mcdonald’s in light of our separation from mcdonald’s and the resulting termination of services and benefits we received from them we have implemented or obtained accounting functions information technology systems employee benefits plans insurance policies and administrative services to replace services or benefits previously provided by mcdonald’s we have limited experience providing or administering these services on our own and we may encounter difficulties with some or all of these arrangements in addition as a result of our separation from mcdonald’s we may not receive the volume pricing benefits or favorable service levels we received from suppliers vendors and distribution centers as a mcdonald’s affiliate we may also need to replace additional suppliers vendors or distribution centers as a result of our separation from mcdonald’s which could adversely affect our business 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

seasonal factors also cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our revenue will also vary as a result of the number of trading days that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock prices to fall we believe the market prices of our class a and class b common stock reflect high market expectations for our future operating results and as a result  if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

the prices of our class a and class b common stock may continue to differ 

our class b common stock has historically traded at lower prices than our class a common stock for instance on february 15 2008 our class a common stock closed at 10525 per share and our class b common stock closed at 9059 per share the trading prices of our class a and class b common stock may continue to differ due to factors outside of our control including differences in market awareness of the two classes trading liquidity of the two classes or other factors in the separation agreement we entered into with mcdonald’s in connection with our separation from them we agreed not to take any action to combine the class a and class b common stock or otherwise eliminate the twoclass capital structure until at least the second anniversary of the separation and for a period of three years thereafter only under certain conditions we may incur a large indemnity obligation to mcdonald’s if the exchange offer is determined to be taxable as a result of our breach of this agreement or any action we take to combine the class a and class b common stock or otherwise eliminate the twoclass structure see “restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of mcdonald’s exchange offer could adversely affect us” below therefore we are not currently considering any such action and we do not plan to consider any such action for the foreseeable future if in the future we do choose to combine the class a and class b common stock or otherwise take action to eliminate the twoclass structure there may be significant costs associated with any such action as a result of the restrictions or indemnities under the separation agreement moreover even if we propose to combine the class a and class b common stock or otherwise eliminate the twoclass structure we can not anticipate how the prices of the class a and class b common stock may react to such an action 

restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of mcdonald’s exchange offer could adversely affect us 

we understand that the exchange offer mcdonald’s completed in october 2006 to dispose of its interest in us should generally be taxfree to mcdonald’s and its shareholders current us tax law generally creates a presumption that a taxfree exchange of the type used by mcdonald’s would be taxable to mcdonald’s but not to its shareholders if we or our shareholders were to engage in a transaction that would result in a 50 or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the fouryear period beginning two years before the date of the exchange unless it is established that the exchange and the transaction are not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership as a consequence of the foregoing in the separation agreement we entered into with mcdonald’s in connection with the separation we have 

 

  

   

  

 the indemnity described above covers corporate level taxes and related losses suffered by mcdonald’s in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership as well as taxes and related losses suffered by mcdonald’s if due to any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated the exchange is determined to be taxable for other reasons we currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s for taxes due in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership could exceed 450 million this estimate which does not take into account related losses depends upon several factors that are beyond our control as a consequence the indemnity to mcdonald’s could vary substantially from the estimate furthermore the estimate does not address the potential indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s in the event that due to any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated the exchange is determined to be taxable for other reasons in that event the total indemnification could extend to taxrelated losses suffered by mcdonald’s shareholders and therefore would likely be much greater 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our class a or class b common stock our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding class a or class b common stock any of these provisions as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with mcdonald’s described above under “restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of mcdonald’s exchange offer could adversely affect us” may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

a lawsuit has been filed against us in california alleging violations of state laws regarding employee recordkeeping meal and rest breaks payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees the case seeks damages penalties and attorney’s fees on behalf of a purported class of our present and former employees we are currently investigating these claims and although we have various defenses it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from this case 

we’re involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or capital resources however a significant increase in the number of these claims or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than we currently anticipate could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows

overview 

chipotle operates fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved today our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity” our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can—ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment animals and people who grow or raise the food 

2007 highlights 

restaurant development  as of december 31 2007 we had 704 restaurants in 33 states throughout the united states and in the district of columbia new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales we opened 125 companyoperated restaurants during 2007 including 10 restaurants in 5 new markets we define a new market as one in which no restaurant was open as of the end of the prior year we expect to open between 130 and 140 restaurants in 2008 including one in toronto canada 

sales growth in addition to growing our number of restaurants we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales of 76 in 2007 and 119 in 2006 driven primarily by strong comparable restaurant sales increases we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for companyoperated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months comparable restaurant sales include companyoperated restaurants only and represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation comparable restaurant sales increases were due mainly to an increase in the number of transactions processed at our registers and menu price increases 

we expect our average restaurant sales to continue to increase in 2008 driven by comparable restaurant sales increases in the low to mid single digits however as a result of several years of doubledigit comparable restaurant sales increases and the potential impact of weaker consumer spending we believe that comparable restaurant sales will not continue to increase at the rates we have achieved over the past several years 

food costs as a result of freezes in california and chile we experienced increased costs for avocados during 2007 and we expect the pricing pressures for avocados to continue through 2008 additionally the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals including corn wheat rice and oil has increased this has resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken beef tortillas and rice and we expect that pressure to continue through 2008 as well we also will have a significant increase in cheese prices for 2008 as a result of the expiration of the pricing protocols under which we operated during 2007 

  

labor labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2007 primarily due to more effective management of staffing through the implementation of a national labor matrix improved employee efficiency as average restaurant sales increased faster than our need to add labor and lower insurance claims experience benefiting us as we became selfinsured in the fourth quarter of 2006 the national labor matrix prescribes labor hours based on projected sales volumes the decrease was partially offset by an increase in hourly employee wages in part from the restaurant structure introduced in 2006 although we have not been directly impacted by recent minimum wage increases we anticipate some upward pressure on our restaurant wages in 2008 in addition because we have now operated a full year with the national labor matrix and selfinsurance structures in place we do not expect to see the same level of labor improvements during 2008 as 2007 

we continue to focus on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food in an effort to achieve this we continue to develop the restaurateur program which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers during 2008 we plan to leverage our restaurateurs’ leadership in neighboring restaurants with opportunities for improvement in addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew our restaurant management structure is designed to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers during 2008 these efforts will continue ensuring we have an effective and efficient field support system for restaurant managers that supports our efforts to identify people with potential develops crew into managers and ensures high operating standards of our restaurants 

throughput we deliver our best customer service and hottest food when the line moves efficiently through effective restaurant staffing and training we continue to increase the number of customers we serve during our busiest hours by the first quarter of 2007 change machines had been installed at the cashier station in virtually all of our restaurants we also began testing a handheld pointofsale terminal in a small number of our restaurants which allows customers to pay with credit cards while waiting in line we continue to review other equipment and kitchen design innovations to improve the speed of service 

food with integrity in addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants we made progress with our food with integrity initiative by increasing the number of our restaurants that serve naturally raised beef and chicken we now serve naturally raised chicken in about 84 of our restaurants and naturally raised beef in about 53 we define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet never given antibiotics or hormones and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded pens all of the sour cream and cheese we serve is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh or recombinant bovine growth hormone to stimulate milk production in 2008 30 of all the beans we buy will be organically grown up from 25 in 2007 we continue to investigate the use of more sustainably grown produce and performed a limited test of the use of locally grown green peppers onions and lettuce during 2007 we expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2008 

franchise acquisitions in march 2007 we completed the acquisition of four franchised restaurants from two franchisees for an aggregate purchase price of 25 million the remaining four franchised restaurants were acquired on april 30 2007 for a purchase price of 32 million 

commitments and contingencies in june 2007 after determining the reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card transactions and related costs was no longer needed we reversed the remaining 12 million reserve into income see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

restaurant openings relocations and closures 

the following table details restaurant unit data for our companyoperated and franchised locations for the years indicated 

 

 results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as our business grows as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs increase 

restaurant sales 

 

 the significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and strong comparable restaurant sales performance restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to 1672 million of the increase in sales in 2007 of which 838 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year in 2006 restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to 1108 million of the increase in sales of which 465 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2006 

comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to 981 million and 841 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2007 and 2006 respectively we believe comparable restaurant sales increases were driven primarily by an increasing awareness of our brand increased customer loyalty and our focus on improving service time the substantial majority of our comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the 

  

number of transactions and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken 

food beverage and packaging costs 

 

 food beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2007 due to increased product cost primarily avocados chicken and steak partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken as well as an improvement in food controls we have seen cost pressures as a result of freezes in california and chile which impacted citrus and avocado crops and we expect these cost pressures along with pressure from significantly higher food costs for items such as wheat and corn to continue into 2008 

in 2006 food costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to menu price increases and favorable commodity costs partially offset by increased food costs associated with our food with integrity initiative 

labor costs 

 

 labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2007 primarily due to more effective management of staffing improved employee efficiency as average restaurant sales increased faster than our need to add labor and lower insurance claims benefiting us as we became selfinsured in the fourth quarter of 2006 the decrease was partially offset by an increase in hourly employee wages 

in 2006 labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher average restaurant sales partially offset by additional staffing costs as we transitioned to our enhanced restaurant structure we launched the enhanced restaurant management structure in the second quarter of 2006 focusing on developing a defined path for crew to become restaurant managers this has enabled more promotions from within our existing crew which has lowered turnover and decreased training costs in 2007 

occupancy costs 

 

 in 2007 and 2006 occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base partially offset by higher rents for new locations 

  

other operating costs 

 

 other operating costs as a percentage of revenue declined in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base and operating efficiencies that are realized as we both grow in size and become more experienced we also realized a benefit in 2007 and 2006 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires 

general and administrative expenses 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2007 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and an increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from the stockbased compensation awards granted in 2007 and the onetime broad based option award granted in 2006 in conjunction with our initial public offering the 2007 increase was partially offset by the reversal of the credit card contingency reserve in the second quarter of 2007 and costs incurred for the exchange offer conducted by mcdonald’s in the third quarter of 2006 a secondary offering of our common stock in the second quarter of 2006 and severance costs incurred in the first and second quarters of 2006 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2006 primarily resulted from increased employee related expenses driven by hiring more employees increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from the onetime broad based option grant in conjunction with our initial public offering incremental legal and audit costs due to growth and becoming a public company costs incurred in conjunction with the secondary and exchange offers related to mcdonald’s disposition of its interest in us and increases in severance expense 

as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses decreased in 2007 and 2006 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base the reversal of the credit card contingency in the second quarter of 2007 and the costs incurred for the secondary and exchange offers and severance negatively impacting 2006 

depreciation and amortization 

 

 depreciation and amortization increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the increase of 303 restaurants from january 1 2005 to december 31 2007 in addition in 2007 and 2006 we accelerated depreciation on 

  

certain restaurant and office locations as a result of relocations or closures which have occurred or will occur as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization has decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

preopening costs 

 

  

 preopening costs increased in 2007 primarily due to an increase in restaurant openings in 2007 preopening costs increased in 2006 primarily as a result of the adoption of fasb staff position no fas 131 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period “fsp 131” fsp 131 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense had fsp 131 been effective prior to 2006 we would have recognized additional preopening costs of approximately 42 million in 2005 

loss on disposal of assets 

 

 the increase in 2007 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants the upgrade of restaurant security systems and an increase in the writeoffs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected the increase in 2006 in loss on disposal of assets was due to a pending closure of one restaurant at the landlord’s request the closure of one restaurant due to structural damage in the leased space and the writeoff of obsolete or unused equipment 

interest income 

 

  

 in 2007 interest income decreased primarily due to an increase in investments in taxexempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes in 2006 interest income increased as a result of investing our incremental cash and cash equivalents in shortterm investments with maturities of three months or less our incremental cash and cash equivalents resulted from our initial public offering proceeds and cash from operations 

  

income tax provision benefit 

 

  

 the 2007 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to increased investments in taxexempt securities and a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate the improvement was partially offset by a 05 million tax effect from nondeductible costs associated with the secondary offering and splitoff transaction in 2006 

the total tax provision for 2006 of 268 million represents a 393 effective tax rate during 2005 we determined that it was more likely than not we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of 203 million resulting in a 75 million tax benefit and an effective tax rate benefit of 247 excluding the 203 million nonrecurring tax benefit the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 426 the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to a decrease in the estimated statutory state rate for enacted changes in state tax laws the favorable impact of changes in our state tax footprint due to growth the declining impact of meals and entertainment disallowance as taxable income increases our investing in taxexempt securities and a permanent difference related to stockbased compensation in 2005 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2007 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

 

  

 seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our restaurant sales are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the 

  

number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results overall on an annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening in addition unanticipated events also impact our results accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs we have a cash cash equivalent and shortterm investment balance of 1712 million that we expect to utilize along with cash flow from operations to provide capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants and to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes we believe that cash from operations together with our cash balance will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months 

in august 2007 we entered into a revolving line of credit with a principal amount of 15 million which expires in august 2008 the line of credit is for support of letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and normal shortterm working capital needs the line of credit bears interest at our option at the prime rate a fixed rate determined by the bank or an adjusted libor rate as of december 31 2007 no amounts were outstanding 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth 

while operations continue to provide cash our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development as we expand into more urban areas our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites our total capital expenditures for 2007 were 141 million and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 150 million in 2008 relating primarily to our construction of new restaurants in both periods in 2007 we spent on average about 880000 in development and construction costs per restaurant with endcaps costing about 740000 inlines costing about 930000 freestanding costing about 11 million and urban costing about 14 million in each case reduced for landlord reimbursements the average development and construction costs per restaurant increased from 860000 in 2006 due to opening a larger portion of our restaurants in urban locations being partially offset by a decline in the percentage of freestanding restaurant openings and decreasing our average restaurant size in 2008 we expect average development and construction costs to be approximately 900000 per restaurant as a result of developing in higher cost markets as well as inflation in construction costs 

  

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 were as follows 

 

  

 we’re obligated under noncancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food labor fuel insurance utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs additionally many of our leases require us to pay taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease most of our restaurant locations our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we account for our leases under fasb statement no 13 accounting for leases “fas 13” which requires rent to be recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term including reasonably 

  

assured renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award’s fair value we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates the volatility assumptions were derived primarily from historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us and our volatility while a public company had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options our stockbased compensation expense and result of operations could have been different 

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health workers’ compensation general liability and property damage pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2007 and 2006 once resolved however these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows 

sabbatical liability 

we offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete we record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense 

adoption of new accounting standards 

in september 2006 the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued eitf issue no 062 accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 43 accounting for compensated absences “eitf 062” the eitf concluded that sabbatical leave accumulates pursuant to the criteria of statement of accounting standard no 43 accounting for compensated absences “fas 43” and therefore the benefit should be accrued if the remaining criteria of fas 43 are met eitf 062 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 eitf 062 can be applied as a change in accounting principle either as a 

  

cumulativeeffect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption or as retrospective application to all prior periods we offer sabbatical leave to employees who have provided ten years of services previously we expensed sabbatical costs as incurred 

we determined an estimated accrued sabbatical balance as of december 31 2006 of 26 million which we recognized as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the first quarter of 2007 during 2007 the assumptions used were changed to estimate the accrual for only the sabbatical currently being earned in addition the tax impact of the cumulative effect adjustment had been excluded as a result we adjusted the amount of the cumulativeeffect adjustment that was recorded to retained earnings effective january 1 2007 to 10 million net of taxes of 675000 we have deemed the impact of the adjustment to be immaterial to the consolidated balance sheet for each of the 2007 quarterly reports during the year ended december 31 2007 we accrued sabbatical expense of 331000 net of taxes of 212000 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition adoption of fin 48 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities “fas 159” fas 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings fas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we do not expect to elect the option to measure any existing financial instruments at fair value therefore we do not expect the adoption of fas 159 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements “fas 157” fas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and expands disclosure about fair value measurements fas 157 applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we do not expect the adoption of fas 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend changing interest rates 

we’re exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2007 we had 1635 million deposited in shortterm investments and availableforsale securities bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of 36 approximately 52 tax equivalent 

commodity price risks 

we’re also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities that are affected by weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at sometime in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula 

  

pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices though we do not have longterm supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient we also sometimes buy supplies at current market or spot prices we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues weather crises and other world events that may affect supply prices longterm increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our future results if we could not increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons similarly if we believe the ingredient price increase to be short in duration we may choose not to pass on the cost increases which could adversely affect our shortterm financial results

 item 1 business 

general 

chipotle mexican grill inc “chipotle” or the “company” operates more than 570 restaurants in 26 states and the district of columbia with an additional eight franchise restaurants as of december 31 2006 our restaurants serve a simple menu of tacos burritos salads and burrito bowls a burrito without the tortilla made using fresh ingredients people outside our company tend to categorize us as a “fast casual” concept—restaurants that are a step up from traditional fast food but not casual sitdown places we’ve never worried much about what category we’re in instead we remain focused on trying to find the best ingredients we can get to make the best tasting food we can on recruiting and retaining really great people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is unique and genuine and on building restaurants that are complementary to the food we serve while also operationally efficient and with increasing awareness and respect for the environment 

chipotle began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved today we’re working to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining we also are pursuing our vision of “food with integrity”—which to us means finding the best raw ingredients from the best sources including naturally raised meats where the animals are fed a vegetarian diet and not given antibiotics or hormones 

we manage our restaurants based on three regions that all report into a single segment financial information about our operations including our revenues and net income for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 and our total assets as of december 31 2006 and 2005 is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our predecessor corporation world foods inc was founded in colorado in 1993 mcdonald’s corporation made an equity investment in us in february 1998 becoming our majority shareholder and simultaneous with mcdonald’s initial investment in us world foods inc merged with chipotle mexican grill inc a newlyformed delaware corporation we completed our initial public offering of class a common stock in january 2006 mcdonald’s sold a portion of its interest in us in the initial public offering sold an additional portion of its interest in us in a secondary offering of class a common stock in may 2006 and disposed of its remaining interest in us in an exchange offer to its shareholders that was completed in october 2006 as a result of the completion of the mcdonald’s exchange offer we now have two publiclytraded classes of common stock class a and class b and mcdonald’s no longer owns any interest in us 

our menu and food preparation 

a few things thousands of ways we serve only a few things burritos burrito bowls tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce there’s enough variety to extend our menu to provide more than 65000 choices we plan to keep a simple menu but we’ll consider additions that we think make sense for example in 2005 we rolled out a salad that uses the same ingredients as our burritos and tacos with the addition of chipotlehoney vinaigrette that we make in the restaurant daily and if you can’t find something on the menu that’s quite what you’re after let us know if we can make it from the ingredients we have we’ll do it 

in preparing our food we use gas stoves and grills pots and pans cutting knives wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice ingredients we use include marinated chicken carnitas seasoned and braised pork barbacoa spicy shredded beef marinated steak and pinto and vegetarian black beans we add our rice which is tossed with real 

  

lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce tomatoes peppers and onions depending on each customer’s request we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole and salsas to round out our main menu items we also serve tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt in addition to sodas and fruit drinks most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas and a majority of our food is prepared from scratch in our restaurants not simply reheated and slapped together to order 

food served fast…so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees assembling the food our employees have prepared while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a “fastfood” experience even when they’re not in a hurry and while our restaurants often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible we’ve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our restaurant layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and we believe more efficient and we’re focused on further improving the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic for instance our restaurants accept orders by fax or over the internet in order to allow customers in a hurry to avoid standing in line to wait for their food by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our restaurants to keep pace at even our highestvolume restaurants we believe that we can provide the chipotle experience to more and more customers 

“food with integrity” more than anything food is what motivates us and we’re always looking to make the food we serve better as part of our vision for “food with integrity” we believe that using fresh ingredients is not enough so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our ingredients come from and how the animals are raised because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on where we obtain each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food all of our pork for example is naturally raised coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet never given antibiotics or hormones and raised in open pastures or deeply bedded barns we also serve naturally raised chicken in about 55 of our restaurants and naturally raised beef in about 44 of our restaurants we’re also enthusiastically investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees while still charging reasonable prices for our food today about 25 of all of the beans we buy are organically grown that is they meet us food and drug administration standards for “organic” at each restaurant we mix those organically grown beans with other ingredients that are not organic and now all of the sour cream we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rbgh or recombinant bovine growth hormone to stimulate milk production we even work with experts in the areas of animal ethics to try to support more humane farming practices and we visit the farms and ranches that raise the animals and grow the produce that we use 

we do however face challenges in pursuing this approach including the length of time it takes to identify and secure relationships with suppliers and the costs and risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients naturally raised meat and sustainably grown vegetables are more costly and the growth process is longer herd losses can also be greater when animals aren’t treated with antibiotics and hormones given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area we believe that consumers’ increasing concern about where and how food is raised and in the environmental management animal husbandry and labor practices of food suppliers will foster demand for these foods we believe that increased demand for naturally raised meat and produce will in turn attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers that said we understand that we’ll continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing “food with integrity” with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if our focus resonates with consumers it should improve our sourcing flexibility although we would expect that these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than commoditypriced equivalents for some time to come 

  

quality assurance and food safety chipotle is committed to serving safe high quality food to our customers quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line we have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs including farm supplier and distributor audits our training department develops and implements operating standards for food quality preparation and safety in the restaurants our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable state and local food safety regulations 

restaurant management and operations 

people with passion we value the individuality of our company our employees and our customers which we believe results in a management operations and training philosophy distinct from that of our competitors we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards but that allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we also produce training materials that are thought provoking and which engage our employees rather than providing rigid stepbystep scripts or lengthy policy manuals through our culture diversity and language programs that we provide in all of our markets we teach english to spanishspeaking workers and spanish to englishspeakers which helps staff to better serve customers and makes for tighter crews this program helps encourage our staff members to develop skills that will enhance their work experience and enrich their personal lives 

importance of methods and culture although we have many restaurants we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques used by many traditional fastfood and fastcasual restaurants helps to set us apart our crews use classic cooking methods they marinate and grill meats handchop produce and herbs make fresh salsa and guacamole and steam rice in small batches throughout the day they work in kitchens that better resemble those of highend restaurants than they do a typical fastfood place despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation we believe that we produce greattasting food with an efficiency that enables us to compete effectively 

the front line is key our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service all of our restaurant employees are encouraged to have genuine interactions with customers no matter their specific job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting and keeping people who can deliver that experience for each customer “one burrito at a time” we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among restaurant managers crew members and customers alike 

the basics each restaurant typically has a restaurant manager a position we’ve characterized as the most important in the company an assistant manager one or two hourly line managers one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of approximately 22 to 24 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our restaurants which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees we tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants we crosstrain our people so that each can work a variety of stations allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times while giving our people greater variety and the opportunity to develop a wider variety of skills consistent with our emphasis on customer contact we encourage our restaurant managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day and although they may increase our labor costs we believe that the benefits we provide to our employees which include language training and our company car program for longerterm restaurant managers help us to attract and keep good restaurant managers and crew members 

in addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant we also have area managers responsible on average for about seven restaurants each and operations directors responsible on average for 

  

about 60 restaurants each our three regional directors who report to our president and chief operating officer each supervise between two to five operations directors 

provisions and supplies 

close relationships with vendors maintaining the high quality levels we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers we use various suppliers carefully selected based on quality and their understanding of our brand and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols although we do not have longterm supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues weather crises and other world events that may affect supply prices 

we do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers instead we train distribution centers to purchase ingredients and other supplies for us based upon our specifications and to negotiate the terms of purchase with raw materials suppliers on our behalf 

distribution arrangements we deliver ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants from 16 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers as we continue to expand geographically we will add additional regional distribution centers 

marketing 

we believe the best and most recognizable brands aren’t built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone but rather through deeply held beliefs that are clear in how the company is run all of the ways that we project ourselves—beginning with each customer’s experience in our restaurants the look and feel of our restaurants our advertising and promotional programs and the design items that carry our name or logo—influence how people think about us by adhering to this principle we believe that chipotle is well on its way to becoming a highly recognized brand 

when we open a new restaurant we plan a range of activities to introduce chipotle to the local community to help create interest in the restaurant from the start our advertising primarily includes print outdoor transit and radio ads and most recently a student ad contest where students from more than 70 colleges and universities produced chipotle “tv” ads that appeared on the popular youtube website in addition we continue to generate considerable media coverage with scores of publications writing favorably about our food restaurant concept and business and our food and restaurants have been featured in a number of television news programs 

although our marketing program has many components we believe the single greatest contributor to our success has been wordofmouth with our customers learning about us and telling others some of our customers have gone so far as to develop websites about chipotle providing a way for chipotle customers to share their stories this kind of support helps promote our business without requiring additional advertising expenditures 

competition 

the fastcasual segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented in addition fastcasual restaurants compete against other segments of the restaurant industry including quickservice restaurants and casual dining restaurants the number size and strength of competitors vary by region all of these restaurants compete based on a number of factors including taste speed of service value name recognition restaurant location and customer service competition within the fastcasual restaurant segment however focuses primarily on taste quality and the freshness of the menu items and the ambience and condition of each restaurant 

  

we compete with national and regional fastcasual quickservice and casual dining restaurants our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and inrestaurant cafés of several major grocery store chains many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources have been in business longer and have greater name recognition than we have and are better established than we are in the markets where our restaurants are located or are planned to be located 

we believe we’re wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current favorable consumer trends including the increasing impact of hispanic culture on food and flavors the growth of the mexican food segment and increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared some of our competitors have formats similar to ours we believe however that chipotle is rapidly becoming one of the most recognized fastcasual restaurants and is known for its focus on using a variety of fresh ingredients and commitment to “food with integrity” which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average daily restaurant sales are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year 

our intellectual property and trademarks 

“chipotle” “chipotle mexican grill” “chipotle mexican grill in stylized font” “unburritable” “food with integrity” “fresh is not enough anymore” “the gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands” the chili pepper logo design the foil burrito design and the chipotle medallion design are us registered trademarks of chipotle we have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the us in addition to our us registrations we own the trademarks for “chipotle mexican grill” in australia brazil and mexico and for “chipotle” in australia and the european union among other countries we have filed trademark applications for “chipotle” the chili pepper logo design and the foil burrito design in canada and have applied to register some of our marks in a number of additional countries 

we also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress from time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks restaurant designs or advertising although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

information systems 

chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office this system includes a pointofsales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant additionally the pointofsales system is used to authorize batch and transmit credit card transactions to record employee time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis which enables management to continually monitor operating results we believe that our current pointofsales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had about 15000 employees including 1500 salaried employees and 13500 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants and is subject to many unpredictable factors 

there were 581 chipotle restaurants as of december 31 2006 we plan to open a significant number of new restaurants over the next three years we may not be able to open new restaurants as quickly as planned we have experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again delays or failures in opening new restaurants could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results as we operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline in addition one of our biggest challenges is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites competition for those sites in our target markets is intense and lease costs are increasing particularly for urban locations our ability to open new restaurants also depends on other factors including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 although we plan to open a total of between 95 and 105 restaurants in 2007 we may not be able to do so for the reasons described in this risk factor in addition our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may occur at an uneven rate which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods in addition this growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales are less than we expect 

while future sales growth will depend substantially on our plans for new restaurant openings the level of comparable restaurant sales which include companyowned restaurants only and represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher than the profit margin on new restaurant sales as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base while we do not expect comparable restaurant sales growth to continue at historical levels and expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2007 in the low to mid single digits due to difficult comparisons our plans do incorporate increases in comparable restaurant sales our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends in part on our ability to successfully implement our initiatives to increase the speed at which our crew serves each customer and expanded use of fax service lines and online ordering either of which may not happen adverse weather conditions impact from competition including competition from new restaurants we open and customer resistance to price increases could also adversely impact our comparable restaurant sales it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales growth or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative if this were to happen sales and profit growth would be adversely affected 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants our existing restaurant management systems financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain restaurant managers and crew we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management crew and existing infrastructure we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow however we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

new restaurants once opened may not be profitable and the increases in average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results 

historically many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new market higher fixed costs relating to increased construction and occupancy costs and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants new restaurants may neither be profitable nor have similar results as our existing restaurants in addition our average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales likely will not continue to increase at the 

  

rates achieved over the past several years our ability to operate new restaurants profitably and increase average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales will depend on many factors some of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to open restaurants as quickly as planned or if new restaurants do not perform as planned our business and future prospects could be harmed in addition changes in our average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales could cause our operating results to vary adversely from expectations which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 

our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas 

some of our new restaurants are planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience those markets may have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as a result those new restaurants may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the chipotle brand and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture restaurants opened in new markets may also have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher construction occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets we may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall profitability 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as beef chicken cheese avocados beans tomatoes and pork could adversely affect our operating results although we have risk management strategies in place to mitigate the impact that these fluctuations have on our operating results we as all restaurant companies remain susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases product recalls and government regulations we are still assessing the impact of the recent winter freeze in california and the southwestern us but expect that we will see some resulting pressure on our food costs additionally due to increased demand for ethanol the cost of corn has increased substantially which may lead to inflationary pressures on cornsourced ingredients including chicken and beef and could adversely affect our food costs 

  

additional instances of e coli avian flu “mad cow” disease or other foodborne illnesses could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat or produce we use to prepare our food cause the temporary closure of some restaurants and result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales 

in 2006 outbreaks of e coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains asian and european countries have also experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems other foodborne illnesses such as hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past and could in the future adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers as a result our sales may decline 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry which could adversely affect sales if we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable in addition we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of making these changes and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors if our customers become ill from foodborne illnesses we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants could materially harm our business 

we may face difficulties transitioning services mcdonald’s provided to us and entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or service providers 

we historically benefited from our relationship with mcdonald’s for example mcdonald’s provided us directly or through mcdonald’s own vendor relationships with accounting services insurance policy coverage banking services health and other insurance benefits for our employees and employee benefit plans as well as with its expertise in certain areas of our operations such as real estate we also benefited from our relationship with mcdonald’s when we bought supplies or distribution or other services for example mcdonald’s relationship with cocacola helped us obtain beneficial beverage pricing and we have relied on some of the same thirdparty distribution networks as mcdonald’s 

as a result of our separation from mcdonald’s effective october 12 2006 we are now responsible for securing all of our own management financial tax accounting legal and other resources in light of our separation from mcdonald’s and the resulting termination of services and benefits we received from them we have implemented or obtained accounting functions information technology systems employee benefits plans insurance policies and administrative services to replace services or benefits previously provided by mcdonald’s we have limited experience providing or administering these services on our own and we may encounter difficulties with some or all of these arrangements we estimate the incremental costs of employee benefits insurance information technology services and beverages due to our separation from mcdonald’s to be between 10 million and 20 million in 2007 however we cannot quantify with certainty the total impact the separation will have on our expenses in addition as a result of our separation from mcdonald’s we may not receive the volume pricing benefits or favorable service levels we received from suppliers vendors and distribution centers as a mcdonald’s affiliate we may also need to replace additional suppliers vendors and distribution centers as a result of our separation from mcdonald’s which could adversely affect our business 

our insurance coverage and selfinsurance reserves may not cover future claims 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health workers’ compensation general liability and property damage in conjunction with our separation from mcdonald’s we entered into certain new insurance 

  

policies with modified coverage prior to entering into the new policies we were covered by fixed cost policies for health insurance and workman’s compensation we are now selfinsured for our health plans and have purchased a fullyinsured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs we are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for workers’ compensation general liability and property damage insurance 

for policies under which we are responsible for losses we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results or the brand identity that we have tried to create 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our success depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels our sales may decline during economic downturns which can be caused by various economic factors such as high gasoline prices or during periods of uncertainty such as those that followed the terrorist attacks on the united states in 2001 any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

competition from other restaurant companies could adversely affect us 

the fastcasual quickservice and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer and often have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than we have among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally as we expand further in existing markets our existing restaurants may face competition from our new restaurants that begin operating in those markets 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our 

  

competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost “value meal” menu options a strategy we do not pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover new companies may enter our markets and target our customers for example additional competitive pressures have come more recently from the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have 

all of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

we may have experienced a security breach with respect to certain customer credit and debit card data and we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 

in august 2004 the merchant bank that processes our credit and debit card transactions which we refer to as the acquiring bank informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of credit and debit card data together with two forensic auditing firms we investigated the alleged theft and reviewed our information systems and information security procedures we also reported the problem to federal law enforcement authorities and cooperated in their investigation while to date we have not discovered conclusive evidence that a theft occurred we identified some restaurant practices that may have made information systems at our restaurants vulnerable during periods before august 2004 notably without our knowledge the card processing software we used inadvertently retained credit and debit card “track 2” data consisting of among other items the customer’s name card number card expiration date and card verification number in addition the internet gateways on our computers in some restaurants may not have been fully secure at all times as a result outside parties may have gained access to stored information it is possible that all of the cards we processed since we began accepting them in 1999 may have been vulnerable in the three months prior to being notified of the problem we processed between 13 million and 15 million credit and debit card charges each month 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of this matter as long as a credit or debit card is active fraudulent charges may be made using that card until the card’s expiration date we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings by various interested parties including banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators the statutes of limitation for pursuing some of these potential claims may extend for six years or more in some cases depending on the circumstances moreover the application of the law and the rules and procedures of the major card associations in these circumstances is generally untested any lawsuit or other proceeding will likely be complex costly and protracted which could in turn divert financial and management resources from execution of our business plan we have no way to predict the level of claims or the number or nature of proceedings that may be asserted against us nor can we quantify the costs that we may incur in connection with investigating responding to and defending any of them if we litigate these matters we may not be able to defend against penalties successfully the ultimate outcome of this matter could differ materially from the amounts we have recorded in our reserve and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

despite the changes we have made to our information systems as a result of this matter we still need to periodically upgrade our software we rely on commercially available software and other technologies to provide security for processing and transmission of customer credit card data during 2006 and 2005 approximately half of our sales were attributable to credit card transactions and we expect credit card usage to increase our systems 

  

could be compromised in the future which could result in the misappropriation of customer information or the disruption of our systems either of those consequences could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business or subject us to additional liabilities 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on multiple suppliers for our pork chicken and beef supplies it could be more difficult to replace our pork suppliers if we were no longer able to rely on them due to the unique nature of the products we receive from them we do not have longterm contracts with any of our suppliers in addition we have relied on the same distribution network as mcdonald’s we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers with pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu if that were to happen affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter if our customers change their dining habits as a result our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

in addition our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to adhere to the principle of “food with integrity” we use a substantial amount of naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients and try to make our food as fresh as we can in light of pricing considerations as we increase our use of these ingredients the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained our inability to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis or at all could cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with the principle of “food with integrity” that could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like competition increased minimum wage requirements employee benefits and changes due to our new restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees including especially restaurant managers and crew members our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings result in higher employee turnover or require us to change our culture any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly 

governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 

we are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for 

  

new restaurants which could delay planned restaurant openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations and other areas we may in the future have to modify restaurants for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons the expenses associated with these modifications could be material 

our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions along with the us americans with disabilities act family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters several states in which we operate have recently enacted minimum wage increases and these increases as well as proposed federal minimum wage increases could increase our labor costs 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus at the federal state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus for example the new york city board of health has adopted a regulation requiring that restaurants that make calorie information publicly available must include that information on their menus and menu boards we may in the future become subject to other initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food which could increase our expenses 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants many environmental laws applicable to us provide for significant fines penalties and liabilities sometimes without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or actual or alleged exposure to such substances we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations we believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner and operator to address any remaining contamination any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos and the unique ambience of our restaurants if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

  

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 seasonal factors also cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our revenue will also vary as a result of the number of trading days that is the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock prices to fall we believe the market prices of our class a and class b common stock reflect high market expectations for our future operating results and as a result if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant 

restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of mcdonald’s exchange offer could adversely affect us 

we understand that the exchange offer mcdonald’s completed in october 2006 to dispose of its interest in us should generally be taxfree to mcdonald’s and its shareholders current us tax law generally creates a presumption that a taxfree exchange of the type used by mcdonald’s would be taxable to mcdonald’s but not to its shareholders if we or our shareholders were to engage in a transaction that would result in a 50 or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the fouryear period beginning two years before the date of the exchange unless it is established that the exchange and the transaction are not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership as a consequence of the foregoing in the separation agreement we entered into with mcdonald’s in connection with the separation we have 

 

   

  

  

 the indemnity described above covers corporate level taxes and related losses suffered by mcdonald’s in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership as well as taxes and related losses suffered by mcdonald’s if due to any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated the exchange is determined to be taxable for other reasons we currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s for taxes due in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership could exceed 450 million this estimate which does not take into account related losses depends upon several factors that are beyond our control as a consequence the indemnity to mcdonald’s could vary substantially from the estimate furthermore the estimate does not address the potential indemnification obligation to mcdonald’s in the event that due to any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated the exchange is determined to be taxable for other reasons in that event the total indemnification would likely be much greater 

our antitakeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us which could adversely affect the price of our class a or class b common stock our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult including provisions relating to the nomination election and removal of directors the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders in addition delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding class a or class b common stock any of these provisions as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with mcdonald’s described above under “restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of mcdonald’s exchange offer could adversely affect us” may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders

in addition we’re involved in claims relating to the possible theft of our customers’ credit and debit card data through the end of december 2006 we have received claims through the acquiring bank with respect to fewer than 2000 purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges allegedly arising out of this matter in an aggregate amount of about 14 million we’ve also incurred 13 million of expense in connection with fines imposed by the visa and mastercard card associations on the acquiring bank in 2004 we recorded charges of 40 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges the cost of replacing cards monitoring expenses and fees and fines imposed by visa and mastercard all of the reimbursement claims are being disputed although we’ve not formally protested all of the charges as of december 31 2006 after charging these expenses against the reserve the remaining reserve was 12 million in addition to the reserve we’ve also incurred about 15 million of additional expenses in this matter including 14 million for legal fees bringing our total expense relating to this matter to 55 million we have not reserved any additional amounts to date in 2007 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of this matter we have no way to predict the level of claims or the number or nature of proceedings that may be asserted against us nor can we quantify the costs that we may incur in connection with investigating responding to and defending any of them if we litigate these matters we may not be able to defend against penalties successfully the ultimate outcome of this matter could differ materially from the amounts we’ve recorded in our reserve and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition see item 1a “risk factors—we may have experienced a security breach with respect to certain customer credit and debit card data and we’ve incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information”

overview 

chipotle operates fast casual fresh mexican food restaurants serving burritos tacos bowls and salads we began with a simple philosophy demonstrate that food served fast doesn’t have to be a traditional “fastfood” experience over the years that vision has evolved today we’re working to change the way people think about and eat fast food we do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience looking to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call “food with integrity”—which to us means finding the best raw ingredients from the best sources to include in the food we serve quite simply we combine these ideas in a way that continues making chipotle better all the time 

as of december 31 2006 we had 581 restaurants in 26 states throughout the united states and in the district of columbia including eight restaurants operated by franchisees new restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth in the last three years we opened 94 companyoperated restaurants during 2006 including 14 restaurants in six new markets we expect to open between 95 and 105 restaurants in 2007 with approximately 10 to 15 of those openings located in new markets we define a new market as one in which no restaurant was open as of the end of the prior year 

in addition to growing our number of restaurants we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales of 119 in 2006 and 58 in 2005 driven primarily by strong comparable restaurant sales increases we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12month sales for companyowned restaurants in operation for at least 13 months comparable restaurant sales include companyowned restaurants only and represent the change in periodoverperiod sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation 

we expect our average restaurant sales to continue to increase in 2007 driven by comparable restaurant sales increases in the low to mid single digits comparable restaurant sales reflect positive periodtoperiod growth due to an increase in the number of transactions as well as menu price increases however as a result of several years of doubledigit comparable restaurant sales increases we believe that comparable restaurant sales will not continue to increase at the rates we have achieved over the past several years 

highlights 

initial public offering on january 25 2006 we completed our initial public offering of our class a common stock with net proceeds of 1209 million in conjunction with the offering we issued a onetime broad based grant of 774150 stock options the options vest on the third anniversary of the grant date compensation expense is generally recognized equally over the three year vesting period 

mcdonald’s disposition in october 2006 mcdonald’s completed its disposition of its interest in us historically our relationship with mcdonald’s allowed us to obtain pricing benefits for some products and services as a result of our separation from mcdonald’s we have implemented new employee benefit plans as well as new insurance accounting information technology payroll and internal audit arrangements we estimate the incremental costs of these new plans and arrangements combined with additional supply costs as a result of our separation from mcdonald’s to be between 10 million and 20 million in this first year of separation 

  

promoting from within during 2006 we focused on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food in an effort to achieve this we initiated the restaurateur program which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers in addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew restaurateurs’ compensation is partially dependent on achieving these expectations as a result we expect this program will help us retain top performing restaurant managers we currently have exceptional managers in the program and we expect to promote more managers to restaurateurs during 2007 

we have seen that restaurant managers who were previously crew members operate better restaurants and are less likely to leave the company therefore in addition to the restaurateur program we have created a new restaurant staffing structure to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers one primary goal of the new structure is to increase the number of restaurant managers hired from within our company and lower restaurant manager turnover we implemented the new staffing structure in over 50 of our restaurants during 2006 and the remaining restaurants are expected to be converted in 2007 

while we are still early in the programs we have seen some positive results over half of the restaurant manager positions we filled in 2006 were staffed with internal promotions up from 31 in 2005 our turnover among restaurant management has decreased approximately 12 in 2006 we have not seen the full impact of the initiatives in our financial results in 2006 as implementing the restaurateur program and the new staffing structure have resulted in incremental staff training and development costs in 2007 and future years we expect these initiatives to result in a majority of restaurant managers being hired through internal promotions 

throughput we deliver our best customer service and hottest food when the line moves efficiently during 2006 we continued to emphasize increasing the number of customers we serve during our busiest hours we increased the number of fax and internet production lines in our restaurants which moved big orders off the front line made improvements in the line and equipment configurations and emphasized optimal utilization of our second cash register we have seen success in this initiative through increased transactions during peak lunch and dinner hours and shorter wait time we plan to continue this focus into 2007 including installing change machines in most of our restaurants as well as evaluating other equipment configurations and technological process improvements 

food with integrity during 2006 in addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all of our restaurants we made progress with our food with integrity initiative by increasing the amount of naturally raised beef and chicken we serve in our restaurants in addition now all of the sour cream we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given growth hormones to stimulate milk production we also continue to investigate the use of more sustainably grown produce and produce that is locally grown 

  

restaurant openings relocations and closures 

the following table details restaurant unit data for our companyowned and franchised locations for the years indicated 

 

 results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and periodoverperiod variances are discussed in the following section as our business grows as we open more restaurants and hire more employees our restaurant operating costs increase 

restaurant sales 

 

 the significant factors contributing to our increase in sales in 2006 were new restaurant openings and strong comparable restaurant sales performance restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to 1108 million of the increase in sales in 2006 of which 465 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year in 2005 restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to 1091 million of the increase in sales of which 473 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2005 

comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to 841 million and 474 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2006 and 2005 respectively comparable restaurant sales increases were driven primarily by an increasing awareness of our brand and our focus on improving service time the substantial majority of our comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturallyraised beef or chicken 

  

food beverage and packaging costs 

 

 food beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2006 and 2005 due primarily to menu price increases and favorable commodity costs partially offset by increased food costs associated with our food with integrity initiative in 2005 the favorable commodity costs were partially offset by increased fuel costs we do not expect the favorable commodity costs that we have seen over the past couple years to continue into 2007 we have already seen cost pressures as a result of the winter freeze in california and the southwestern us which impacted citrus and avocado crops additionally due to increased demand for ethanol the cost of corn has increased substantially which we expect will lead to inflationary pressures on cornsourced ingredients including chicken and beef 

labor costs 

 

 in 2006 labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher average restaurant sales partially offset by additional staffing costs as we transition to our new restaurant structure we launched the new restaurant management structure in the second quarter of 2006 focusing on developing a defined path for crew to become restaurant managers we expect that this will enable more promotions from within our existing crew which we believe will lower turnover result in better managers and decrease training costs 

in 2005 labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased largely due to improved employee efficiency employee efficiency resulted in increased number of transactions which did not require a corresponding increase in staff and a gradual improvement over time in staffing our restaurants with the most appropriate number of crew members for each restaurant 

occupancy costs 

 

 in 2006 and 2005 occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base the improvement in 2005 was partially offset by inflationary pressure on rents and the opening of restaurants in more expensive locations such as new york city 

  

other operating costs 

 

 other operating costs as a percentage of revenue declined primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base and operating efficiencies that are realized as we both grow in size and become more experienced we also realized a benefit in 2006 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires 

general and administrative expenses 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2006 primarily resulted from increased employee related expenses driven by hiring more employees over the past two years increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the onetime broad based option grant in conjunction with our initial public offering incremental legal and audit costs due to growth and becoming a public company costs incurred in conjunction with the secondary and exchange offers related to mcdonald’s disposition of its interest in us and increases in severance expense the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2005 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of fasb statement no 123r stockbased compensation “fas 123r” the increase in expense in 2005 was offset by the 40 million charge in 2004 to establish a reserve related to potential credit card liabilities as a percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses decreased in 2006 and 2005 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

depreciation and amortization 

 

 depreciation and amortization increased in 2006 and 2005 primarily due to the 278 total restaurants openings from january 1 2004 to december 31 2006 in addition in 2006 we accelerated depreciation on certain restaurant and office locations as a result of relocations or closures which have occurred or will occur as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization has decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixedcost base 

  

preopening costs 

 

  preopening costs increased in 2006 primarily as a result of the adoption of fasb staff position no fas 131 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period “fsp 131” fsp 131 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense fsp 131 applies to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 accordingly we recognized additional preopening costs of 38 million in 2006 under this principle had fsp 131 been effective prior to 2006 we would have recognized additional preopening costs of approximately 42 million in 2005 and 36 million in 2004 

loss on disposal of assets 

 

 the increase in 2006 in loss on disposal of assets was due to a pending closure of one restaurant at the landlord’s request the closure of one restaurant due to structural damage in the leased space and the writeoff of obsolete or unused equipment the increase in 2005 was largely due to additional writeoffs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected as well as writeoffs of obsolete equipment as a result of software upgrades 

interest income 

 

  interest income increased as a result of investing our incremental cash and cash equivalents in shortterm investments with maturities of three months or less our incremental cash and cash equivalents resulted from our initial public offering proceeds and cash from operations 

income tax provision benefit 

 

    

the total tax provision for 2006 of 268 million represents a 393 effective tax rate during 2005 we determined that it was more likely than not we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of 203 million resulting in a 75 million tax benefit and an effective tax rate benefit of 247 excluding the 203 million nonrecurring tax benefit the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 426 the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to a decrease in the estimated statutory state rate for enacted changes in state tax laws the favorable impact of changes in our state tax footprint due to growth the declining impact of meals and entertainment disallowance as taxable income increases our investing in taxexempt securities and a permanent difference related to stockbased compensation in 2005 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters ended december 31 2006 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

 

 seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our restaurant sales are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results overall on an annual basis changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening because we have tended to open more new restaurants later in the fiscal year our fourth quarter net income may be lower than in other quarters in addition unanticipated events also impact our results for example in the second quarter of 2005 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of 203 million resulting in a net tax benefit of 167 million in that quarter accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction working capital and general corporate needs until our initial public offering we had financed these requirements primarily through 

  

equity sales to mcdonald’s and others as well as through cash flows from operations in january 2006 we completed our initial public offering of class a common stock receiving net proceeds of approximately 1209 million we expect to use the net proceeds from the offering together with cash flow from operations to provide additional longterm capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes 

in october 2006 we entered into a revolving line of credit with a principal amount of 10 million which expires in august 2007 the line of credit is for support of letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and bears interest at our option at the prime rate a fixed rate determined by the bank or an adjusted libor rate 

we haven’t required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 1036 million for 2006 compared to 774 million for 2005 the 262 million increase was primarily attributable to a 241 million improvement in net income excluding the 203 million onetime noncash tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance the increase in net income was driven by higher average restaurant sales higher restaurant margins and significantly more restaurants in operation net cash provided by operating activities was 774 million for 2005 compared to 397 million for 2004 the 378 million increase was primarily attributable to a 316 million improvement in net income driven by higher average restaurant sales higher restaurant margins and significantly more restaurants in operation 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 973 million for 2006 compared to 830 million for 2005 the 143 million increase related to higher capital expenditures in 2006 as we opened 94 restaurants in 2006 compared with 80 restaurants in 2005 net cash used in investing activities was 830 million for 2005 compared to 956 million in 2004 the 126 million decrease related to lower capital expenditures in 2005 as we opened 80 restaurants in 2005 compared with 104 restaurants in 2004 

we categorize our restaurants as either endcaps at the end of a line of restaurants inlines in a line of restaurants freestanding or urban as we expand into central urban areas our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites our total capital expenditures for 2006 were 973 million and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 115 million in 2007 relating primarily to our construction of new restaurants in both periods in 2006 we spent on average about 860000 in development and construction costs per restaurant with endcaps costing about 680000 inlines costing about 795000 freestanding costing about 13 million and urban costing about 22 million in each case reduced for landlord reimbursements the average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from 910000 in 2005 due to a decline in the number of freestanding restaurants adding smaller stores to the mix and a focus on cost control in 2007 we expect average development and construction costs to be approximately 900000 per restaurant as a result of developing in higher cost markets such as boston and philadelphia a slight increase in freestanding restaurants as well as inflation in construction costs 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was 1473 million in 2006 compared to 57 million in 2005 the 1416 million increase was attributable to 1209 million net proceeds from our initial public offering and the 195 million tax sharing payment received from mcdonalds net cash provided by financing activities was 57 million in 2005 compared to 559 million in 2004 the 503 million decrease was attributable to decreased financing requirements as a result of improvements in net cash provided by operating activities and fewer restaurant openings in 2005 as compared to 2004 

  

liquidity and capital expenditures we expect to use the proceeds from the initial public offering to provide additional longterm capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening restaurants and to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes in accordance with a tax allocation agreement we have with mcdonald’s mcdonald’s agreed to compensate us for nols and tax credits it used that were attributable to our operations we expect to receive payment for the federal and some state nols that we have not utilized on a standalone basis as we make estimated tax payments but no later than the first quarter of 2008 as of december 31 2006 the amount owed by mcdonald’s totaled 88 million 

we believe that cash from operations together with the net proceeds from the initial public offering will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 were as follows 

 

  we’re obligated under noncancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline restaurants or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding restaurants our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

inflation 

the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food fuel labor insurance and utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs additionally many of our leases require us to pay taxes maintenance utilities and insurance all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 

critical accounting estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult 

  

subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leases 

we lease most of our restaurant locations our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods we account for our leases under fasb statement no 13 accounting for leases “fas 13” which requires rent to be recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods we have estimated that our lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially 

stockbased compensation 

effective january 1 2005 we adopted fas 123r which requires recognition of the fair value of stockbased compensation over the vesting period of the option we use the blackscholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates the volatility assumptions were derived from our annual independent stock valuations and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could have been different 

insurance liability 

we maintain various insurance policies for employee health workers’ compensation general liability and property damage pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances in addition our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2006 and 2005 once resolved however these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows in addition we’re involved in claims relating to the possible theft of our customers’ credit and debit card data in 2004 we recorded charges of 40 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards and monitoring expenses and fees as of december 31 2006 the remaining reserve was 12 million as the situation develops and more information becomes available the amount of the reserve may increase or decrease accordingly see item 1a “risk factors— we may have experienced a security breach with 

  

respect to certain customer credit and debit card data and we’ve incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information ” 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued eitf issue no 062 accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 43 accounting for compensated absences “eitf 062” the eitf concluded that sabbatical leave accumulates pursuant to the criteria of fasb standard no 43 accounting for compensated absences “fas 43” and therefore the benefit should be accrued if the remaining criteria of fas 43 are met eitf 062 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 eitf 062 can be applied as a change in accounting principle either as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption or as retrospective application to all prior periods we have elected to adopt eitf 062 as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to beginning retained earnings the actuarially determined estimated accrued sabbatical balance as of december 31 2006 is 26 million 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the cumulative effect upon adoption of applying the provision shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year presented separately we do not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material impact on our financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fasb staff position aug air1 accounting for planned major maintenance activities “fsp aug1” fsp aug1 prohibits the use of the accrueinadvance method of accounting for costs of planned major maintenance projects the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we do not utilize the accrueinadvance method and therefore do not expect the adoption of fsp aug1 to have a material impact on our financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fasb standard no 157 fair value measurements “fas 157” fas 157 provides a definition of fair value and acceptable methods of measuring fair value we do not expect the adoption of fas 157 to have a material impact on our financial statements 

in september 2006 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements “sab 108” sab 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year’s financial statements are materially misstated sab 108 permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption by recording the necessary “correcting” adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings only if material under the dual method sab 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november 15 2006 we have assessed the effect of adopting this guidance and has determined that there will be no impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend changing interest rates 

we’re exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash and cash equivalents since the completion of our initial public offering we have invested our cash in shortterm investments with maturities of three months or less changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2006 we had 1500 million deposited in shortterm investments bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of 461 

  

commodity price risks 

we’re also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities that are affected by weather seasonality production availability and other factors outside our control we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at sometime in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices though we do not have longterm supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient we also sometimes buy supplies at current market or spot prices we’ve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues weather crises and other world events that may affect supply prices longterm increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our future results if we could not increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons similarly if we believe the ingredient price increase to be short in duration we may choose not to pass on the cost increases which could adversely affect our shortterm financial results

 item 1 business 

who we are and what we do general 

chipotle mexican grill inc chipotle or the company develops and operates fast casual fresh mexican food restaurants in 21 states throughout the united states and in the district of columbia as of december 31 2005 we operated 481 restaurants and had eight restaurants operated by franchisees we completed our initial public offering of class a common stock in january 2006 mcdonalds corporation mcdonalds is our majority owner with beneficial ownership of approximately 87 of the combined voting power of our outstanding stock and 65 of our economic interest after the initial public offering we manage our operations based on four regions and have aggregated our operations into one reportable segment financial information regarding our operations assets and liabilities including our revenues and net income loss for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 and our total assets as of december 31 2005 and 2004 is included in our consolidated financial statements and respective notes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we became a subsidiary of mcdonalds in september 1999 when mcdonalds acquired a controlling stake in us at the same time that our predecessor world foods inc a colorado corporation formed in 1996 merged with chipotle chipotle a corporation formed under the laws of the state of delaware on january 30 1998 was the surviving entity in the merger 

the chipotle philosophy is simple demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a fastfood experience we try to avoid using a formulaic approach when creating our experience and looked to finedining restaurants for inspiration we use highquality raw ingredients classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customer—features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining we compete in a category of dining now called fastcasual the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry where customers expect food quality thats more in line with fullservice restaurants coupled with the speed and convenience of fast food 

we do just a few things but try to do them really well and we plan to keep this intentionally focused strategy as we grow we elevate basic raw ingredients into food thats more sophisticated with layers of flavor through our recipes and cooking techniques our store design also transforms simple materials in distinctive ways giving our stores an architectural style that is not commonly found in typical fastfood restarurants we respect our employees and invite them to share their ideas on how to best serve our customers which we think inspires them to take pride in their work and increases their dedication to our customers and our company from our focused menu to the uncomplicated flow of our stores our simple but thorough management and operations practices and a comparatively small inventory we emphasize keeping things simple so we can focus on serving great food

a few things thousands of ways we serve only a few things burritos burrito bols a burrito without the tortilla tacos and salads but because customers can choose from four different meats two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas guacamole cheese and lettuce theres enough variety to extend our menu to provide more than 65000 choices we plan to keep a simple menu but well consider additions that we think make sense for example we introduced the burrito bol in 2003 and in 2005 we rolled out a salad that uses the same ingredients as our burritos and tacos with the addition of chipotlehoney vinaigrette that we make instore daily 

in preparing our food we use gas stoves and grills pots and pans wire whisks and other kitchen utensils walkin refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice ingredients we use include marinated chicken carnitas seasoned pork barbacoa spicy 

shredded beef marinated steak and pinto and vegetarian black beans we add our rice which is flavored with cilantro and lime as well as freshly shredded cheese sour cream lettuce tomatoes peppers and onions depending on each customers specifications we use various herbs spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables we also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole and salsas to complement our main menu items we also serve tortilla chips seasoned with lime and salt in addition to sodas and other soft drinks most of our stores also offer a selection of beer and margaritas 

we prepare most items from scratch in our stores and weve developed a starttofinish process of food preparation that drives our food ordering process in all of our stores we make our guacamole tomato and corn salsa daily using what we believe are the best available ingredients including hass avocados herbs spices and real citrus juice 

food served fast…so that customers can enjoy it slowly our employees spend hours preparing our food onsite but each customer order can be ready in seconds customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees preparing the food while we think that our customers return because of the greattasting food we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a fastfood experience even when theyre not in a hurry and while our stores often have lines we try to serve customers as quickly as possible weve even been able to serve as many as 300 customers an hour at some locations the natural flow of our store layout including the floor plan and the design of our serving line are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and thus we believe more efficient and were focused on further improving the speed of service in all of our restaurants so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting store traffic by emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews and by continually making improvements to our stores to keep pace at even our highestvolume stores we believe that we can provide the chipotle experience to more and more customers 

 food with integrity we focus on quality service and the chipotle experience at the same time however were committed to emphasizing food with integrity beginning with our suppliers and ending with the way we prepare food for customers because our menu is so focused we can concentrate on where we obtain each ingredient and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food all of our pork for example comes from pigs that are naturally raised in open pastures or deeply bedded barns without being confined or subject to antibiotics we also serve naturally raised chicken in about 45 of our stores and naturally raised beef in about 34 of our stores for us naturally raised means that our suppliers pigs chickens and cattle are raised in humane environments on vegetarian diets without the use of antibiotics it also means that our suppliers dont use hormones which are prohibited by federal regulations for pork and chicken and which we explicitly prohibit for our beef were enthusiastically investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment while still charging reasonable prices for our food today about 20 of all of the beans we buy are organically grown that is they meet us food and drug administration standards for organic at each store we mix those organically grown beans with other ingredients that are not organic we even work with experts in the areas of animal ethics to try to support more humane farming environments and we visit the farms and ranches from which we obtain our ingredients 

we do however face challenges in pursuing this approach including the length of time costs and risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients naturally raised meat and sustainably grown vegetables are more costly and the growth process is longer herd losses can also be greater when animals arent treated with antibiotics and hormones given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area we believe that consumers increasing concern about where and how food is raised and in the environmental management and animal husbandry practices of food suppliers will 

foster demand for these foods we believe that increased demand for naturally raised meat and produce will in turn attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers that said we understand that well continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if our focus resonates with consumers it should improve our sourcing flexibility although we would expect that these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than commoditypriced equivalents for some time to come 

making and selling one burrito at a time store management and operations 

people with passion we value the individuality of our company our employees and our customers which we believe results in a management operations and training philosophy distinct from that of our competitors we make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our stores in a way that is consistent with our high standards but that allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success we also produce training materials that are thought provoking and which engage our employees rather than providing rote stepbystep scripts or rigid policy manuals through our culture diversity and language programs that we provide in all of our markets we teach english to spanishspeaking workers and spanish to englishspeakers which helps staff to better serve customers and makes for tighter crews this program helps encourage our staff members to develop skills that will enhance their work experience and enrich their personal lives 

importance of methods and culture although we have many stores we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques used by many of our competitors sets our vision and our food apart our crews use classic professional cooking methods including slicing marinating and grilling our meats and handchopping many of our vegetables in kitchens resembling those of highend restaurants despite our more laborintensive method of food preparation we believe that we produce food with an efficiency that enables us to compete effectively 

the front line is key our store and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service all our store employees are encouraged to have genuine interactions with customers no matter their specific job whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period we focus on attracting and keeping people who can replicate that experience for each customer one burrito at a time we provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way we believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among store managers crew members and customers alike 

the basics each store typically has a store manager an assistant manager and an average of approximately 22 full and parttime crew members we generally have two shifts at our stores which helps us better predict our store payroll expenses and in return provides our employees with more stable and predictable work hours we tend to have more employees in our busier stores we crosstrain our employees with a view to creating depth of competency in our critical store functions consistent with our emphasis on customer contact we encourage our store managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day and although they may increase our labor costs we believe that the benefits we provide to our employees which include language training and our company car program for longerterm store managers help us to attract and keep good store managers and crew members 

in addition to the employees serving our customers at each store we also have area managers responsible on average for about six stores each and operations directors responsible on average for about 50 stores each our four regional directors who report to our president and chief operating officer each supervise between one to four operations directors 

where we get our ingredients provisions and supplies 

close relationships with vendors maintaining the highquality levels we expect in our stores depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers we purchase from various suppliers carefully selected based on quality and their understanding of our brand and we seek to develop mutually beneficial longterm relationships with them we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward fixed and formula pricing protocols although we do not have longterm supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts weve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues weather crises and other world events that may affect supply prices 

we do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers instead we train suppliers to purchase ingredients and other supplies for us based upon our specifications and to negotiate the terms of purchase with raw materials suppliers on our behalf 

distribution arrangements we deliver ingredients and other supplies to our stores from 16 regional distribution centers of our 16 distribution centers 13 serve mcdonalds its subsidiaries and its franchisees exclusively while the other three have customers other than mcdonalds although this network is comprised of independent distribution centers there is a possiblity that we may need to replace some of them as we become more independent from mcdonalds 

relationship with mcdonalds our relationship with mcdonalds gives us substantial credibility with our suppliers and we have used mcdonalds knowledge of purchasing and supply chain management to negotiate lower prices for example mcdonalds relationship with cocacola has helped us contain our beverage costs we also use many of the same suppliers for our paper and packaging products as we increase our independence from mcdonalds we may face difficulties replacing services it currently provides to us and entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or service providers 

customers who sell for us marketing 

we believe the best and most recognizable brands arent built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone but rather through deeply held beliefs evident in how a company runs its business all of the ways that we project ourselves—beginning with each customers experience in our stores the look and feel of our stores our advertising and promotional programs and the design items that carry our name or logo—influence how people think about us by adhering to this principle we believe that chipotle is well positioned to become a highly recognized brand 

when we open a new store we plan a range of activities to introduce our food to the local community to help create interest in the store from the start and our advertising which includes print outdoor transit and radio ads and most recently a sponsorship of a cooking show on the public broadcasting service has a lowkey and irreverent tone that has been popular with customers in addition a number of publications have written favorably about our food and store concept and our food and stores have been featured in television programs produced without our involvement 

although our marketing program has many components we believe the single greatest contributor to our success has been wordofmouth with our customers learning about us and telling others some of our customers have gone so far as to develop websites about chipotle providing a way for chipotle customers to share their stories this kind of support helps us grow without requiring additional advertising expenditures 

competition 

the fastcasual segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented in addition fastcasual restaurants compete against other segments of the restaurant industry including quickservice restaurants and casual dining restaurants the number size and strength of competitors vary by region all of these restaurants compete based on a number of factors including taste quickness of service value name recognition restaurant location and customer service competition within the fastcasual restaurant segment however focuses primarily on taste quality and the freshness of the menu items and the ambience and condition of each restaurant 

we compete with national and regional fastcasual quickservice and casual dining restaurants our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources have been in business longer have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our stores are located or are planned to be located 

we believe were wellpositioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current favorable consumer trends including the increasing impact of hispanic culture on food and flavors the growth of the mexican food segment and increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat some of our competitors have formats similar to ours we believe however that chipotle is rapidly becoming one of the most recognized fastcasual restaurants and is known for its focus on using a variety of fresh ingredients and commitment to food with integrity which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate 

seasonality 

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average store sales which we define as the average trailing 12month sales for companyowned stores in operation for at least 12 full months are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example stores located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year 

our intellectual property and trademarks 

 chipotle chipotle mexican grill chipotle mexican grill in stylized font unburritable food with integrity fresh is not enough anymore the gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands the chili pepper logo design the foil burrito design and the chipotle medallion design are us registered trademarks of chipotle 

in addition to these us registrations we own the trademarks for chipotle mexican grill in brazil and mexico and for chipotle in australia and the european union among other countries we have also filed trademark applications for chipotle in a number of countries and for chipotle mexican grill in two countries we plan to assign and transfer our interest in our nondomestic trademarks to chipotle international ltd our whollyowned irish subsidiary although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to this intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

information systems 

chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office this system includes a pointofsales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant additionally the pointofsales system is used to authorize batch and transmit credit card transactions to record employee time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis which enables management to continually monitor operating results we believe that our current pointofsales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we had about 13000 employees including 1300 salaried employees and 11700 hourly employees none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

the planned rapid increase in the number of our stores may make our future results unpredictable 

there were 489 chipotle stores as of december 31 2005 260 of which have opened since january 1 2003 we plan to increase the number of our stores significantly in the next three years this growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new store as well as the impact of our new stores on the sales of existing stores may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits our future results depend on various factors including successful selection of new markets and store locations market acceptance of the chipotle experience consumer recognition of the quality of our food and willingness to pay our prices 

which reflect our often higher ingredient costs the quality of our operations and general economic conditions whats more as has happened when other fastcasual restaurant concepts have tried to expand nationally we may find that the chipotle concept has limited or no appeal to customers in certain new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of the chipotle experience newly opened stores may not succeed future markets and stores may not be successful and even if were successful our average store sales may not increase at historical rates 

as we increase our independence from mcdonalds we may face difficulties replacing services it currently provides to us and entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or service providers 

weve benefited from our relationship as a consolidated or majorityowned subsidiary of mcdonalds for example mcdonalds has provided us directly or through its own vendor relationships with accounting services insurance policy coverage banking services health and other insurance benefits for our employees and employee benefit plans as well as with its expertise in certain areas of our operations such as real estate we also benefit from our relationship with mcdonalds when we buy supplies or distribution or other services for example mcdonalds relationship with cocacola has helped us contain our beverage costs and weve relied on the mcdonalds distribution network as long as we are a consolidated or majorityowned subsidiary of mcdonalds we expect to continue to have some of these advantages and in connection with our initial public offering we entered into a services agreement with mcdonalds to clarify our relationship 

following our initial public offering mcdonalds now holds beneficial ownership of shares having about 87 of the combined voting power of our common stock if mcdonalds ownership interest declines significantly in the future well lose an increasing amount of these benefits many of which will not be covered by the services agreement for example we currently obtain beneficial pricing andor service levels from certain suppliers and service providers and pay mcdonalds for the costs they incur in administering our 401k plan and providing certain health benefits including workers compensation for our employees if mcdonalds ceases to own more than 80 of the combined voting power of our outstanding stock well need to administer our 401k plan and provide these health benefits on a standalone basis and could incur increased costs as a result if mcdonalds ceases to own more than 50 of the combined voting power of our outstanding stock we may have to pay more for processing our credit and debit cards and our gift cards our audit fees our property insurance our umbrella and excess liability premiums and our banking services in some cases current benefits such as the use of mcdonalds distribution network are not contractually tied to the level of mcdonalds ownership and the relevant suppliers and service providers could decide to stop giving us beneficial pricing andor service levels even if mcdonalds still owns a substantial equity stake in us 

as we begin to increase our independence from mcdonalds we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers or enter into new arrangements with our existing ones and we may encounter difficulties or be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms as favorable as those we currently enjoy which could harm our business and operating results however because we currently have not begun to negotiate new or amended contracts with suppliers and service providers we cannot now quantify with any certainty potential increases in our expenses furthermore as a public company in each of 2006 and future years we expect to incur a few million dollars of legal accounting and other expenses that were not previously required to be incurred by us as a private company 

we have no independent operating history as a large company which makes our future business prospects difficult to evaluate 

we have been a subsidiary of mcdonalds since 1998 which has affected the way we operate and manage our business because we have no independent operating history as a large company our 

historical results may not be indicative of our future performance our future results depend on various factors including those identified in these risk factors we may not remain profitable 

our sales growth rate depends primarily on our ability to open new stores and is subject to many unpredictable factors 

we may not be able to open new stores as quickly as planned weve experienced delays in opening some stores and that could happen again delays or failures in opening new stores could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results as we operate more stores our rate of expansion relative to the size of our store base will decline in addition one of our biggest challenges is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new store sites competition for those sites in our target markets is intense and lease costs are increasing particularly for urban locations our ability to open new stores also depends on other factors including 

• obtaining and negotiating leases with acceptable terms • hiring and training qualified operating personnel in the local market • managing construction and development costs of new stores at affordable levels particularly in competitive markets • the availability of construction materials and labor • the availability of and our ability to obtain adequate supplies of ingredients that meet our quality standards • securing required governmental approvals including construction parking and other permits in a timely manner and • the impact of inclement weather natural disasters and other calamities such as hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 although we plan to open between 80 and 90 stores in 2006 we may not be able to do so for the reasons described in this risk factor in addition our progress in opening new stores from quarter to quarter may occur at an uneven rate 

our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comp store sales are less than we expect 

while future sales growth will depend substantially on our plans for new store openings the level of sales at stores open at least 13 full months which we call comp store sales will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth this is because the profit margin on comp store sales is generally higher than the profit margin on new store sales as comp store sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base while we dont expect comp store sales growth to continue at historical levels our plans do incorporate positive comp store sales our ability to increase comp store sales depends in part on our ability to successfully implement our initiatives to increase the speed at which our crew serves each customer and expanded use of fax service lines and online ordering which we may not be able to do it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comp store sales growth or that the change in comp store sales could be negative if this were to happen sales and profit growth would be adversely affected 

our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

our plans call for a significant number of new stores our existing store management systems financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems procedures and controls and to hire train and retain store managers and crew we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management crew and 

existing infrastructure we also place a lot of importance on our culture which we believe has been an important contributor to our success as we grow however we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 

new stores once opened may not be profitable and the increases in average store sales and comp store sales that weve experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results 

historically our new stores have opened with an initial rampup period typically lasting 24 months or more during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new market higher fixed costs relating to increased construction and occupancy costs and other startup inefficiencies that are typical of new stores new stores may neither be profitable nor have results comparable to our existing stores in addition our average store sales and comp store sales which we define as the change in periodoverperiod sales for the comparable store base which includes companyoperated stores opened for at least 13 months likely will not continue to increase at the rates achieved over the past several years our ability to operate new stores profitably and increase average store sales and comp store sales will depend on many factors some of which are beyond our control including 

• executing our vision effectively • initial sales performance of new stores • competition either from our competitors in the restaurant industry or our own stores • changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending • consumer understanding and acceptance of the chipotle experience • road construction and other factors limiting access to new stores • general economic conditions which can affect store traffic local labor costs and prices we pay for the ingredients and other supplies we use and • changes in government regulation if we fail to open stores as quickly as planned or if new stores dont perform as planned our business and future prospects could be harmed in addition changes in our average store sales or comp store sales could cause our operating results to vary adversely from expectations which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 

our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas 

some of our new stores are planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience those markets may have different competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as a result those new stores may be less successful than stores in our existing markets consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the chipotle brand and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision passion and culture stores opened in new markets may also have lower average store sales than stores opened in existing markets and may have higher construction occupancy or operating costs than stores in existing markets whats more we may have difficulty in finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us either initially or over time with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards sales at stores opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels and may never do so thereby affecting our overall profitability 

we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higherquality food 

our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higherquality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our stores relative to prices offered by some of our competitors particularly those in the quickservice segment we may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food and they may not care even if they do understand our approach that could require us to change our pricing advertising or promotional strategies which could materially and adversely affect our results or the brand identity that weve tried to create 

changes in customer tastes and preferences spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline 

changes in customer preferences general economic conditions discretionary spending priorities demographic trends traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry our success depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels our sales may decline during economic downturns which can be caused by various economic factors such as high gasoline prices or during periods of uncertainty such as those that followed the terrorist attacks on the united states in 2001 similarly hurricanes katrina and rita are affecting consumer confidence and are likely to affect our supply costs nearterm construction costs for our new stores and may affect our sales going forward any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family food away from home spending could cause our sales operating results profits business or financial condition to decline if we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate 

competition from other restaurant companies could adversely affect us 

we operate in the fastcasual segment of the restaurant industry this segment is highly competitive with respect to among other things taste price food quality and presentation service location and the ambiance and condition of each restaurant we also compete with restaurants in the quickservice and casual dining segments our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains our competitors offer dinein carryout and delivery services many of our competitors have existed longer and often have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than chipotle our parent mcdonalds operates in the quickservice segment of the restaurant industry among our main competitors are a number of multiunit multimarket mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts some of which are expanding nationally as we expand further in existing markets our existing stores may face competition from our new stores that begin operating in those markets 

several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences many of our competitors in the fastcasual and quickservice segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lowercost value meal menu options a strategy we dont pursue our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition 

moreover new companies may enter our markets and target our customers for example additional competitive pressures have come more recently from the deli sections and instore cafés of several major grocery store chains including those targeted at customers who want higherquality food as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets these competitors may have among other things lower operating costs better locations better facilities better management more effective marketing and more efficient operations 

all of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits 

additional instances of avian flu or of mad cow disease or other foodborne illnesses could adversely affect the price and availability of chicken beef or other meat cause the temporary closure of some stores and result in negative publicity thereby resulting in a decline in our sales 

asian and european countries have experienced and continue to experience outbreaks of avian flu incidents of mad cow disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds these problems foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past and could in the future adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers as a result our sales may decline 

instances of foodborne illnesses real or perceived whether at our stores or those of our competitors could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry which could adversely affect sales if we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the chipotle experience we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our stores profitable in addition we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of making these changes and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors if our customers become ill from foodborne illnesses we could be forced to temporarily close some stores for example in june 2004 texas health officials investigated reports that customers and employees had become ill with flulike symptoms after spending time in one of our stores and we closed that store for less than a week a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our stores could materially harm our business 

changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu such as beef chicken cheese avocados beans tomatoes and pork could adversely affect our operating results although we try to manage the impact that these fluctuations have on our operating results we remain susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions seasonal fluctuations weather conditions demand food safety concerns generalized infectious diseases product recalls and government regulations for example higher diesel prices have in some cases resulted in the imposition of surcharges on the delivery of commodities to our distributors which they have generally passed on to us to the extent permitted under our arrangements with them in 2004 hurricanes in some parts of the united states damaged tomato crops and drove prices higher similarly in 2005 hurricane katrina destroyed a number of chickens raised by one of our chicken suppliers and increased our shortterm chicken prices both hurricanes katrina and rita have resulted in higher diesel and gasoline prices are affecting consumer confidence and are likely to affect our supply costs and nearterm construction costs for our new stores in addition in 2004 prices for chicken rose significantly due to a ban by asian countries on their chicken exports following outbreaks of avian flu avian flu continues to spread and could potentially impact our cost for chicken in the future we do not have longterm supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts as a result we may not be able to anticipate or react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices or menu prices which could cause our operating results to deteriorate in addition because we provide moderately priced food we may choose not to or be unable to pass along commodity price increases to our customers 

we may have experienced a security breach with respect to certain customer credit and debit card data and we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 

in august 2004 the merchant bank that processes our credit and debit card transactions the acquiring bank informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of credit and debit card data together with two forensic auditing firms we investigated the alleged theft and reviewed our information systems and information security procedures we also reported the problem to federal law enforcement authorities and have cooperated in their investigation while to date we have not discovered conclusive evidence that a theft occurred we identified some store practices that may have made information systems at our stores vulnerable during periods before august 2004 notably without our knowledge the card processing software we used inadvertently retained credit and debit card track 2 data consisting of among other items the customers name card number card expiration date and card verification number in addition the internet gateways on our computers in some stores may not have been fully secure at all times as a result outside parties may have gained access to stored information it is possible that all of the cards we processed since we began accepting them may have been vulnerable in the three months prior to being notified of the problem we processed between 13 million and 15 million credit and debit card charges each month 

through the end of february 2006 we have received claims through the acquiring bank with respect to fewer than 2000 purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges allegedly arising out of this matter in an aggregate amount of about 13 million weve also incurred 13 million of expense in connection with fines imposed by the visa and mastercard card associations on the acquiring bank in 2004 we recorded charges of 40 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges the cost of replacing cards monitoring expenses and fees and fines imposed by visa and mastercard all of the reimbursement claims are being disputed although weve not formally protested all of the charges as of december 31 2005 after charging these expenses against the reserve the remaining reserve was 18 million which does not take into account an unpaid fine of 04 million assessed by mastercard in december 2005 that we expect to apply against the reserve in 2006 in addition to the reserve weve also incurred about 15 million of additional expenses in this matter including 13 million for legal fees bringing our total expense relating to this matter to 55 million we have not reserved any additional amounts to date in 2006 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of this matter as long as a credit or debit card is active fraudulent charges may be made using that card until the cards expiration date we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings by various interested parties including banks and credit unions that issue cards cardholders either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit and federal and state regulators the statutes of limitation for pursuing some of these potential claims may extend for six years or more in some cases depending on the circumstances moreover the application of the law and the rules and procedures of the major card associations in these circumstances is generally untested any lawsuit or other proceeding will likely be complex costly and protracted which could in turn divert financial and management resources from execution of our business plan we have no way to predict the level of claims or the number or nature of proceedings that may be asserted against us nor can we quantify the costs that we may incur in connection with investigating responding to and defending any of them if we litigate these matters we may not be able to defend against penalties successfully the ultimate outcome of this matter could differ materially from the amounts weve recorded in our reserve and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events which could further adversely affect our results and prospects 

despite the changes weve made to our information systems as a result of this matter we still need to periodically upgrade our software we rely on commercially available software and other technologies to provide security for processing and transmission of customer credit card data during 2005 a significant portion of our sales were attributable to credit card transactions and we expect credit card usage to increase our systems could be compromised in the future which could result in the misappropriation of customer information or the disruption of our systems either of those consequences could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business or subject us to additional liabilities we engaged internet security systems iss to perform our visa payment card industry audit iss submitted our full report on compliance roc on december 30 2005 the roc stated that iss felt chipotle had controls that were either in place or in place with compensating controls for every section of the roc we are awaiting a response from visa either accepting our roc or requesting further clarification 

failure to receive frequent deliveries of higherquality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations 

our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand problems in production or distribution food contamination inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of our ingredients which could harm our operations if any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected we currently depend on three or four suppliers for our pork chicken and beef supplies it could be more difficult to replace our pork suppliers if we were no longer able to rely on them due to the unique nature of the products we receive from them we do not have longterm contracts with any of our suppliers in addition weve relied on the mcdonalds distribution network as we begin to increase our independence from mcdonalds we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers if we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our stores which could cause a store to remove items from its menu if that were to happen affected stores could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter if our customers change their dining habits as a result our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe 

in addition our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to adhere to the principle of food with integrity we use a substantial amount of naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients and try to make our food as fresh as we can in light of pricing considerations as we increase our use of these ingredients the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained our inability to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a costeffective basis or at all could cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with the principle of food with integrity that could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors including 

• the impact of inclement weather natural disasters and other calamities such as hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 • the timing of new store openings and related revenues and expenses 13 

• operating costs at our newly opened stores which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation • labor availability and wages of store management and crew • profitability of our stores especially in new markets • changes in comp store sales and customer visits including as a result of the introduction of new menu items • variations in general economic conditions including those relating to changes in gasoline prices • negative publicity about the ingredients we use or the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or other problems at our stores • changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending • increases in infrastructure costs and • fluctuations in supply prices seasonal factors also cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter our average store sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people are eating out and higher during the spring summer and fall months for the opposite reason our revenue will also vary as a result of the number of trading days that is the number of days in a quarter when a store is open 

as a result of these factors results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year average store sales or comp store sales in any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in that event the price of our common stock would likely decrease 

our success depends substantially upon the continued retention of certain key personnel 

we believe that our success has depended and continues to depend to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team the members of our management team currently are employed by us on an atwill basis and may resign from our employment at any time subject in certain cases to the forfeiture of options or unvested shares they may hold our failure to retain members of that team could materially adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts theyve undertaken with respect to our business in particular the loss of steve ells our founder and chief executive officer monty moran our president and chief operating officer jack hartung our chief finance and development officer or bob wilner our chief administrative officer could materially adversely affect us 

our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right teams for our stores 

labor is a primary component of our operating costs and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our store managers and crew increased labor costs due to factors like competition increased minimum wage requirements and employee benefits would adversely impact our operating costs our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire motivate and keep qualified employees including especially store managers and crew members our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned store openings result in higher employee turnover or require us to change our culture any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly 

our franchisees could take actions that harm our reputation and reduce our royalty revenues 

we do not exercise control over the daytoday operations of our franchised stores while we try to ensure that franchised stores meet the same operating standards that we demand of companyoperated stores one or more franchised stores may not do so any operational shortcomings of our franchised stores are likely to be attributed to our systemwide operations and could adversely affect our reputation and have a direct negative impact on the royalty revenues we receive from those stores 

we expect to need capital in the future and we may not be able to raise that capital on acceptable terms 

developing our business will require significant capital in the future prior to our initial public offering we funded our operations and growth primarily through capital investments by mcdonalds and to a lesser degree our minority shareholders and in some cases shortterm borrowings from mcdonalds that we repaid through private placements of our equity securities however mcdonalds has no obligation to continue providing us with capital in the future to meet our capital needs we expect to rely on our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our initial public offering should we need additional funding third party financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors including market conditions our operating performance lender sentiment and our ability to incur debt in compliance with thenexisting contractual restrictions these factors may make the timing amount terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive our inability to raise capital could impede our growth 

were subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to longterm noncancelable leases and with respect to the real property that we own owning real estate 

our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 20 years and generally can be extended only in fiveyear increments at increased rates if at all all of our leases require a fixed annual rent although some require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount generally our leases are net leases which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar longterm noncancelable leases if an existing or future store is not profitable and we decide to close it we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including among other things paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term in addition as each of our leases expires we may fail to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations also because we purchase real property for various store locations from time to time were subject to all of the risks generally associated with owning real estate including changes in the investment climate for real estate demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the stores which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area as well as strict joint and several liability for environmental contamination at or from the property regardless of fault 

governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 

we are subject to various federal state and local regulations each of our stores is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health alcoholic beverage sanitation food and workplace safety and other agencies we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new stores which could delay planned store openings in addition stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations 

we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment public accommodations 

and other areas we may in the future have to modify stores for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons the expenses associated with these modifications could be material 

our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions along with the us americans with disabilities act family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters in addition federal proposals to introduce a system of mandated health insurance and flexible work time and other similar initiatives could if implemented adversely affect our operations 

in recent years there has been an increased legislative regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry restaurants operating in the quickservice and fastcasual segments have been a particular focus as a result we may in the future become subject to initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food that could increase our expenses 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge storage handling release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances environmental laws these environmental laws provide for significant fines penalties and liabilities sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or actual or alleged exposure to such substances we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations we have however conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by thirdparty operations which we believe have or should be addressed by the third party if the relevant third party does not or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely then under certain environmental laws we could be held liable as an owner and operator to address any remaining contamination any such liability could be material further we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 

our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks service marks trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property including our name and logos and the unique ambience of our stores if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance we may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations this could harm our image brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 

we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 

our customers occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that were responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our stores or that we have problems with food quality or operations were also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business including personal injury claims contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters discrimination and similar matters and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future for example were currently investigating issues that may arise in connection with the possible theft of certain credit and debit card data were also subject to dram shop statutes which generally allow persons injured by intoxicated people to recover damages from the place that wrongfully served those people alcohol regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether were ultimately held liable claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance a judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects which in turn could adversely affect our results 

in addition the restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell and disclosure and advertising practices we may also be subject to this type of proceeding in the future and even if not publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quickservice and fastcasual segments of the industry may harm our reputation or prospects and adversely affect our results 

we will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company 

as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company the us sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and related rules of the us securities and exchange commission or sec and the new york stock exchange regulate corporate governance practices of public companies compliance with the requirements applicable to a public company will increase our costs and make some activities more timeconsuming for example we have created new board committees and adopted new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures in addition we will incur additional expenses associated with our sec reporting requirements a number of those requirements will require us to carry out activities we have not done previously for example under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act for our annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2007 well need to document and test our internal control procedures our management will need to assess and report on our internal control over financial reporting and our independent accountants will need to issue an opinion on that assessment and the effectiveness of those controls furthermore if we identify any issues in complying with those requirements for example if we or our accountants identified a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues and the existence of those issues could adversely affect us our reputation or investor perceptions of us costs to obtain director and officer liability insurance are generally greater for public companies and we will incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage as a result of the associated liability it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers advocacy efforts by shareholders and third parties may also prompt even more changes in governance and reporting requirements we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 

were controlled by mcdonalds whose interests may conflict with those of our investors 

currently mcdonalds beneficially owns no shares of our class a common stock but owns about 90 of our outstanding class b common stock representing 87 of the combined voting power of our outstanding stock and 65 of the economic interest in our outstanding common stock accordingly as it has since 1998 when we became its subsidiary mcdonalds continues to exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs including the composition of our board of directors and any action requiring the approval of our shareholders including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation the issuance of additional shares of equity securities the payment of dividends and the approval of mergers or a sale of substantially all of our assets the concentration of ownership may also make some transactions including mergers or other changes in control more difficult or impossible without the support of mcdonalds mcdonalds interests may conflict with your interests as a shareholder 

conflicts of interest between mcdonalds and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us 

various conflicts of interest between mcdonalds and us could arise many of our officers own stock in mcdonalds in some cases it could be more than the amount of chipotle common stock they own in addition one of our directors mats lederhausen is managing director of our controlling shareholder mcdonalds ventures llc ownership interests of directors or officers of mcdonalds in the common stock of chipotle or a persons service as either a director or officer of both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when those directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for mcdonalds and chipotle these decisions could for example relate to 

• disagreement over corporate opportunities • competition between us and mcdonalds • management stock ownership • employee retention or recruiting • our dividend policy and • the services and arrangements from which chipotle benefits as a result of its relationship with mcdonalds potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we enter into any new commercial arrangements with mcdonalds in the future our directors and officers who have interests in both mcdonalds and us may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between mcdonalds and chipotle our restated certificate of incorporation includes the following provisions relating to corporate opportunities of us and mcdonalds which provisions will remain in effect for so long as mcdonalds owns at least 5 of our outstanding common stock or at least one person who is a director or officer of us is also a director or officer of mcdonalds 

• mcdonalds will not have a duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us and neither mcdonalds nor any of its officers or directors will be liable to us or our shareholders for breach of any duty by reason of any such activities • if mcdonalds acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for mcdonalds and us mcdonalds will have no duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us and will not be liable to us or our shareholders for breach of any duty as our shareholder if mcdonalds pursues or acquires such corporate opportunity for itself 18 

directs such corporate opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate information about or offer such corporate opportunity to us 

• if a corporate opportunity is offered to • one of our officers or employees who is also a director but not an officer or employee of mcdonalds that opportunity will belong to us unless expressly offered to that person primarily in his or her capacity as a director of mcdonalds in which case it will belong to mcdonalds • one of our directors who is also an officer or employee of mcdonalds that opportunity will belong to mcdonalds unless expressly offered to that person primarily in his or her capacity as our director in which case it will belong to us and • any person who is either i an officer or employee of both us and mcdonalds or ii a director of both us and mcdonalds but not an officer or employee of either one that opportunity will belong to mcdonalds unless expressly offered to that person primarily in his or her capacity as our director in which case such opportunity shall belong to us prior to our initial public offering our tax allocation agreement with mcdonalds provided that mcdonalds as our parent had the sole authority to file federal income tax returns and most state income tax returns on our behalf and that mcdonalds would be responsible for administering that agreement until the consummation of the initial public offering this arrangement terminated for federal and some state income tax purposes for taxable periods following the initial public offering however the tax allocation agreement remains in effect for taxable years prior to the initial public offering and for some state returns consequently this may result in conflicts of interest between mcdonalds and us for example mcdonalds may choose to contest compromise or settle any adjustment or deficiency proposed by the relevant taxing authority in a manner that may be beneficial to mcdonalds and detrimental to us and for which we may be required to reimburse mcdonalds under the tax allocation agreement the tax allocation agreement will continue to apply to and govern the sharing of tax liabilities between mcdonalds and us for state tax purposes for those states in which we and mcdonalds will continue to file tax returns on a combined basis 

future sales or distributions of our shares by mcdonalds could depress our class a common stock price 

after the initial public offering and subject to the currently applicable lockup period described below mcdonalds may sell all or a portion of the shares of our class b common stock that it owns which shares would be converted automatically into class a shares in connection with any sale prior to a taxfree distribution or distribute those shares to its shareholders including a distribution in exchange for mcdonalds shares or securities or another similar transaction sales by mcdonalds in the public market or distributions to its shareholders of substantial amounts of our common stock or the filing by us on behalf of mcdonalds of a registration statement relating to a substantial amount of our common stock could depress our class a common stock price mcdonalds has informed us that at some time in the future but no earlier than the expiration of the lockup period it may sell all or a portion of its ownership interest in us or may make a taxfree distribution including a distribution in exchange for mcdonalds shares or securities or another similar transaction to its shareholders of all or a portion of that interest mcdonalds is not subject to any contractual obligation to maintain its ownership position in our shares except that it has agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any of our shares of common stock for a period ending 180 days subject to extension after the effective date of initial public offering without the prior written consent of morgan stanley  co incorporated and sg cowen  co llc on behalf of the underwriters subject to specified limited exceptions and extensions consequently mcdonalds may decide not to maintain its ownership of our common stock once the lockup period expires 

in addition mcdonalds will have the right subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering its shares or to include its shares in other registration statements that we may file should mcdonalds exercise their registration rights and sell a large number of shares the price of our class a common stock might decline

 item 3 legal proceedings 

were involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or capital resources however a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

in addition were involved in claims relating to the possible theft of our customers credit and debit card data through the end of february 2006 we have received claims through the acquiring bank with respect to fewer than 2000 purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges allegedly arising out of this matter in an aggregate amount of about 13 million weve also incurred 13 million of expense in connection with fines imposed by the visa and mastercard card associations on the acquiring bank in 2004 we recorded charges of 40 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges the cost of replacing cards monitoring expenses and fees and fines imposed by visa and mastercard all of the reimbursement claims are being disputed although weve not formally protested all of the charges as of december 31 2005 after charging these expenses against the reserve the remaining reserve was 18 million which does not take into account an unpaid fine of 04 million assessed by mastercard in december 2005 that we expect to apply against the reserve in 2006 in addition to the reserve weve also incurred about 15 million of additional expenses in this matter including 13 million for legal fees bringing our total expense relating to this matter to 55 million we have not reserved any additional amounts to date in 2006 

we may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of this matter we have no way to predict the level of claims or the number or nature of proceedings that may be asserted against us nor can we quantify the costs that we may incur in connection with investigating responding to and defending any of them if we litigate these matters we may not be able to defend against penalties successfully the ultimate outcome of this matter could differ materially from the amounts weve recorded in our reserve and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition see item 1a risk factors—we may have experienced a security breach with respect to certain customer credit and debit card data and weve incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information

overview 

how we make money restaurant sales 

we operate fast casual fresh mexican food restaurants in 21 states throughout the united states and in the district of columbia as of december 31 2005 we operated 481 restaurants and had eight restaurants operated by franchisees we generate revenue primarily through restaurant sales which represent sales of food and drinks in stores operated by chipotle our total revenue was 6277 million in 2005 a 333 increase from 2004 and a 989 increase from 2003 driven primarily by the 260 new store openings from january 1 2003 to december 31 2005 and higher average store sales several factors affect our restaurant sales in any period including mainly the number of stores in operation and average store sales we define average store sales as the average trailing 12month sales for companyowned stores in operation for at least 13 months 

new stores in existing and new markets have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth in the last three years we opened 80 104 and 76 stores in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we intend to open 80 to 90 stores in 2006 primarily in existing markets although we do expect to enter several new markets in 2006 we categorize our stores as either endcaps at the end of a line of stores inlines in a line of stores freestanding or urban as we expand into central urban areas our average costs to open new stores will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites in 2005 we spent on average about 910000 in development and construction costs per store with endcaps costing about 730000 inlines costing about 765000 freestanding costing about 12 million and urban costing about 13 million in each case reduced for landlord reimbursements received and excluding rent expense incurred during the construction period preopening cash rent expenses averaged approximately 18000 per restaurant during 2005 excluding approximately 24000 per restaurant in preopening straightline rent during construction 

average store sales for stores open at least 12 full months were 1440 million in 2005 1361 million in 2004 and 1274 million in 2003 there are two main factors increasing our average store sales comp store sales increases which we define as yearoveryear sales comparisons for stores in operation for at least 12 full months disregarding the portion of a month in which a store first begins operating and increases in new store opening sales we believe both of these have been impacted by the growing appeal of our core menu items increasing consumer awareness and appreciation of our food quality and our focus on building customer loyalty 

our comp store sales increases were 102 in 2005 133 in 2004 and 244 in 2003 comp store sales reflect positive periodtoperiod growth due mainly to an increase in the number of customer transactions in the third quarter of 2005 we began an initiative we call through put which focuses our efforts on improving the customer service time by getting the right crew at the right stations at the right time doing the right things in the right order we think the crew at our best performing through 

put restaurants are more attentive and more engaging with customers while also serving them more quickly increases in new store opening sales have occurred primarily because the time it takes a new stores sales to ramp up has shortened as our brand awareness has grown 

we expect our average stores sales to continue to increase in 2006 driven by comp store sales in the mid to high single digits we believe that comp store sales likely will not continue to increase at the rates achieved over the past several years however we also expect to grow income from operations in the longterm at an annual rate of around 25 

how we spend money food beverage and packaging costs labor other restaurant operating costs and other expenses 

we have four basic types of expense food beverage and packaging costs labor other restaurant operating costs consisting of occupancy costs and other operating costs and other expenses consisting of general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization preopening costs and gains or losses on asset disposals as we have grown considerably so have these costs our combined food beverage and packaging costs labor and other restaurant operating costs have increased to 5116 million in 2005 from 3941 million in 2004 and 2680 million in 2003 our other expenses have also increased to 851 million in 2005 from 705 million in 2004 and 554 million in 2003 

food beverage and packaging costs are the largest component of our expenses since we use higherquality ingredients that we purchase from carefully selected suppliers and are increasing our use of more expensive naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients our food expenses are often higher than those of other restaurants that use a higher proportion of commoditypriced ingredients beef chicken cheese avocados beans tomatoes and pork account for the most significant portion of our food beverage and packaging costs the price of these ingredients are the most volatile factor of our cost structure we expect to continue to try to absorb shortterm commodity fluctuations without increasing prices which could negatively impact margins 

our food beverage and packaging costs also include freight costs which can be higher than those of some of our competitors in part because we rely primarily on perishable ingredients rather than on processed food products these freight costs have also been affected by higher diesel prices that have in some cases resulted in the imposition of surcharges on the delivery of commodities to our distributors which they have generally passed on to us to the extent permitted under our arrangements with them 

labor costs which include wages for our store managers assistant store managers and crew bonuses taxes and benefits are the secondlargest component of our expenses we generally have two shifts at most of our stores which helps us better predict our store payroll expenses and in return provides our employees with more stable and predictable work hours some of the benefits we offer to our hourly employees are uncommon such as english and spanish lessons free food and the opportunity to participate in our 401k plan in addition to the benefits above we are also in the early stages of implementing our new restaurateur program which will be offered to our top performing managers and will provide for bonuses as a percentage of incremental sales above a threshold subject to a certain level of incremental profits being generated this program will also provide for incentive payouts for hiring and developing other successful general managers although this program may increase our labor costs in the shortterm we believe that it will help us in the longterm with the development and retention of great general managers for our stores 

other restaurant operating costs include occupancy costs and other operating costs occupancy costs include rent real estate taxes property taxes and common area maintenance charges other operating costs include utilities marketing and promotional costs including free samples bank fees credit and debit card processing fees store supplies repair maintenance and similar costs one of the 

unique employee benefits included in other operating costs is our company car program which is available to store managers who have been with us for more than four years although this and other similarly uncommon benefits may increase our other operating costs we believe it helps us to attract and keep good store managers which is important to our future success 

our other expenses include general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization preopening costs and gains or losses on disposals of assets general and administrative expenses include the corporate and administrative functions that support our stores including employee wages and benefits travel information systems recruiting and training costs corporate rent professional fees supplies and insurance and also include costs for store accounting services we received from mcdonalds depreciation and amortization are periodic noncash charges that represent the reduction in usefulness and value of a tangible asset principally relating to capital expenditures for store construction preopening expenses are expenses related to preparing to open a new store and include the costs of hiring and training the initial work force travel and the cost of food beverage and packaging used in connection with those activities losses on disposal of assets include the costs related to store closures store equipment retirements and costs to investigate potential store sites that we considered but subsequently rejected 

other factors affecting our results 

benefit for income taxes 

during 2005 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance recognizing a nonrecurring 203 million tax benefit tax expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was 128 million resulting in a net tax benefit of 75 million being recognized in the consolidated statement of operations we expect to continue to incur tax expense in 2006 

equity compensation expenses 

we recognized a total of 21 million in stockbased compensation during the year ended december 31 2005 under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r we adopted sfas 123r effective january 1 2005 before its required date of adoption using the modifiedprospective transition method under this transition method our 2005 equity compensation costs of 03 million related to our stock option plan includes the portion vesting in the year for i all sharebased payments granted prior to but not vested as of january 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas 123 and ii all sharebased payments granted after january 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r 

in 2005 we granted 153333 shares of our common stock with a grant date fair value of 1950 per share which vest in equal installments over three years and recognized 14 million of related compensation expense the fair value of the nonvested stock was estimated by management we did not obtain a contemporaneous valuation by an unrelated valuation specialist instead managements valuation framework relied principally on data compiled as a part of its review of strategic options in early 2005 prior to our determination to proceed with our initial public offering because that data reflected market conditions contemporaneous with the grant of the nonvested common stock as well as our thencurrent projections of our results and financial condition management concluded that retention of a separate valuation specialist for purposes of the grant was not necessary 

determining the fair value of our common stock required making complex and subjective judgments particularly since there was no public trading market for our common stock at the time of the valuation we used the market approach to estimate the value of the enterprise when the 

nonvested common stock was granted the market approach uses direct comparisons to other enterprises and their equity securities to estimate the fair value of privately issued securities we relied primarily on the price to earnings methodology and compared our historical and forecasted income growth rate to determine our peer group within the highgrowth restaurant industry and subsequently the appropriate earnings multiple range to apply to our forecasted income in determining our value we then reduced this by a marketability discount due to the lack of liquidity for our common stock 

in connection with our initial public offering we converted our outstanding stock appreciation rights sars granted in 2004 which were accounted for as a liability into stock options the options have terms consistent with the original sars including the same vesting schedule vest in full in july 2007 and an exercise price of 2235 per share in january 2006 we compared the fair value of the sars immediately before that conversion to the fair value of the options and recognized compensation costs of approximately 02 million once converted the options are accounted for as an equity award 

in connection with our initial public offering we completed a onetime broad based grant of 774150 options to purchase common stock as a result we expect total stockbased compensation expense of approximately 35 million to 40 million in 2006 

certain trends and uncertainties 

relationship with mcdonalds 

since we became a subsidiary of mcdonalds and began substantially expanding our operations in 1998 mcdonalds has provided a significant portion of the capital needed to operate our business and open new stores generally mcdonalds has done this through direct equity investments although it has also in some cases provided us with shortterm borrowings that we repaid through private placements of our equity securities we expect that mcdonalds will no longer finance us after our initial public offering and well fund our growth with cash flow from operations proceeds from the initial public offering and other sources 

we also currently benefit from our mcdonalds relationship in other ways such as pricing benefits for some products and services we will incur increased costs as a result of our initial public offering and the decrease in mcdonalds ownership interest in us and if mcdonalds ownership interest declines significantly from their current ownership position well lose an increasing amount of these benefits see item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business and industry—as we increase our independence from mcdonalds we may face difficulties replacing services it currently provides to us and entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or service providers for example 

• mcdonalds relationship with cocacola has helped us contain our beverage costs and we may lose some of that pricing advantage if we are no longer a consolidated subsidiary of mcdonalds or we may have to negotiate with other beverage suppliers to remain competitive • as a separate public company well incur legal accounting and other expenses which we expect to be a few million dollars in each of 2006 and future years that we did not incur as a majorityowned private subsidiary of mcdonalds • we opened 104 stores in 2004 when we were able to use mcdonalds real estate personnel and other resources to locate and obtain additional store sites in certain markets we did not use those resources in 2005 and do not anticipate using them in 2006 or in future years and • we expect that some of our labor costs such as workers compensation will increase as mcdonalds ownership interest decreases 28 

sourcing 

our focus on food with integrity has constrained our sourcing flexibility to some extent weve attempted to be careful in expanding that initiative so that we dont outpace available supply some of our ingredients come from small farms that have facilities that must comply with federal or industry standards for classification as natural and they may face economic or other limits on their growth we believe that consumers increasing concern about where and how food is raised environmental management and animal husbandry will foster demand for these foods which will in turn attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers that said we understand that well continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if our focus resonates with consumers it should improve our sourcing flexibility although wed expect that these kinds of ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than commoditypriced equivalents for some time to come 

how we did results of operations 

as our business grows as we open more stores and hire more people our food beverage packaging costs labor and other restaurant operating costs increase our operating results for 2005 2004 and 2003 are expressed as a percentage of total revenue below 



year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

the table below presents our operating results for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 and the related periodtoperiod changes 

  not meaningful restaurant sales of the 1565 million increase in restaurant sales 618 million resulted from 103 companyoperated stores opened in 2004 474 million was due to an increase in comp store sales increases and 473 million was due to 80 companyoperated stores opened in 2005 average store sales for the trailing 12month period ended december 31 2005 increased 58 to 1440 million from 1361 million for the trailing 12month period ended december 31 2004 driven primarily by comp store sales growth of 102 that reflected increasing nationwide awareness of our brand which also enabled new stores to open with higher average sales a substantial majority of the comp store sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in certain markets 

food beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of total revenue food beverage and packaging costs decreased due primarily to a decline in raw ingredient costs and menu price increases partially offset by increased fuel costs 

labor costs labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased largely due to improved employee efficiency resulting from an increase in the number of transactions which did not require a corresponding increase in staff and a gradual improvement over time in staffing our stores with the most appropriate number of crew members for each store 

occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenue occupancy costs decreased due to higher average store sales on a partially fixed cost base the decrease was partially offset by inflationary pressures on rents and the opening of stores in more expensive locations such as new york city 

other operating costs other operating costs as a percentage of total revenue declined primarily due to the effect of higher average store sales on a partially fixedcost base and improvements in store operations over time 

general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and stock based compensation expense resulting from a stock grant and the adoption of sfas 123r the increase in expense was offset by the 40 million charge in 2004 to establish a reserve related to potential credit card liabilities as a 

percentage of total revenue these expenses decreased due primarily to the effect of higher average store sales on a partially fixedcost base 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to stores opened in 2005 and in late 2004 as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization remained relatively consistent at 45 in 2005 and 46 in 2004 

preopening costs preopening costs decreased principally because there were fewer store openings in 2005 than in 2004 

in october 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 131 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 131 fsp 131 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense fsp 131 applies to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 retroactive application is permitted but not required had fsp 131 been effective in 2005 we would have recognized additional preopening costs of approximately 42 million we expect preopening costs to increase as we begin to recognize this expense in 2006 

loss on disposal of assets the increase in loss on disposal of assets was largely due to additional writeoffs associated with investigating potential store sites that we considered but subsequently rejected as well as writeoffs of obsolete equipment as a result of software upgrades 

net interest expense the increase in interest expense net of interest income was due to higher average borrowings from mcdonalds in 2005 than in the comparable 2004 period as mcdonalds did not make any equity contributions in 2005 

benefit for income taxes during 2005 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of 203 million the benefit from the reduction of the valuation allowance was partially offset by our current tax expense of 128 million which resulted in the realization of a net tax benefit of 75 million the 203 million tax benefit was a onetime tax benefit and we expect to incur tax expense prospectively 

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

the table below presents our operating results for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 and the related yeartoyear changes 

  not meaningful 31 

restaurant sales of the 1546 million increase in restaurant sales 628 million resulted from sales by 103 companyoperated stores opened in 2004 501 million resulted from additional sales in 2004 by 74 companyoperated stores opened in 2003 and 417 million was due to comp store sales increases a substantial majority of the comp store sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in certain markets average store sales for 2004 increased 68 to 1361 million from 1274 million for 2003 driven primarily by comp store sales growth of 133 that reflected increasing nationwide awareness of our brand which also enabled new stores to open with higher average store sales 

food beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of total revenue food beverage and packaging costs decreased largely driven by a menu price increase that was partially offset by higher chicken beef cheese and tomato costs 

labor costs labor costs as a percentage of total revenue decreased largely due to improved employee efficiency resulting from an increase in average store sales which did not require a corresponding increase in staff 

occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenue occupancy costs decreased primarily as a result of the effect of higher average store sales on a largely fixedcost base 

other operating costs other operating costs as a percentage of restaurant sales declined primarily due to the effect of higher average store sales on a partially fixedcost base 

general and administrative expenses the 106 million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from a 40 million charge to establish a reserve related to potential credit card liabilities and hiring more employees as we grew as a percentage of total revenue these expenses decreased as a result of our ability to further leverage our existing corporate infrastructure over more stores 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to new stores openings as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization decreased primarily due to the effect of higher average store sales on a largely fixedcost base 

preopening costs the increase in preopening costs was principally due to the opening of 103 companyoperated stores in 2004 an increase of 29 companyoperated store openings from 2003 

loss on disposal of assets the decrease in loss on disposal of assets was largely due to a 20 million writeoff associated with the closing of three stores in 2003 

net interest income the decrease in interest income net of interest expense was due to reduced earnings on average excess cash deposits in 2004 as compared to 2003 

quarterly financial dataseasonality 

the following table presents consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2005 the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 

  seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average store sales are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example stores located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the number of trading days can also affect our results for example 2004 was a leap year which contributed about 3 percentage points of the increase in our restaurant sales in february of that year overall on a yeartoyear basis changes in trading days do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new stores opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new stores have lower margins immediately following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new stores and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening because we tend to open more new stores later in the fiscal year our fourth quarter net income may be lower than in other quarters in addition unanticipated events also impact our results for example in the second quarter of 2005 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of 203 million resulting in a net tax benefit of 167 million in that quarter in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded charges of 40 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges and for the cost of replacing cards and monitoring expenses and fees which reduced our operating income our loss on disposal of assets in the first quarter of 2004 decreased compared to the same period in 2003 largely due to a 20 million writeoff associated with the closing of three stores in the first quarter of 2003 accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new store construction working capital and general corporate needs until our initial public offering we have financed these requirements primarily through equity sales to mcdonalds and others as well as through cash flows from operations as of december 31 2005 we had no cash and cash equivalents on january 25 2006 our initial public offering became effective we will use the net proceeds from the offering of approximately 1213 million to provide additional longterm capital support to the growth of our business primarily through opening stores to continue to maintain our existing stores and for general corporate purposes 

mcdonalds and to a lesser extent some of our minority shareholders have historically provided us with significant financing we have also historically obtained shortterm borrowings from mcdonalds from time to time under documented lines of credit at an interest rate equal to the us prime rate plus 100 basis points the existing line of credit with mcdonalds under which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2005 will expire in june 2006 and is not expected to be renewed loans under these agreements were repaid with proceeds of private placements of our equity securities in april 2004 and june 2003 we issued shares of common stock to mcdonalds and to certain other persons who were accredited investors consisting of friends and family of our employees and persons having business relationships with us in each case as identified in our shareholders agreement for an aggregate purchase price of 650 million and 380 million respectively 

we havent required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 774 million for 2005 compared to 397 million for 2004 the 378 million increase was primarily attributable to a 316 million improvement in net income driven by higher average store sales and higher store margins due to having significantly more stores in operation net cash provided by operating activities was 397 million for 2004 compared to 221 million for 2003 the 176 million increase in 2004 was primarily attributable to a 138 million improvement in net income loss driven primarily by higher average store sales and higher store margins 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 830 million for 2005 compared to 956 million in 2004 the 126 million decrease related to lower capital expenditures in 2005 as we opened 80 stores in 2005 compared with 104 stores in 2004 net cash used in investing activities was 956 million for 2004 compared to 861 million for 2003 the increase was primarily as a result of higher capital expenditures as we opened 104 stores in 2004 compared to 76 in 2003 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was 57 million in 2005 compared to 559 million in 2004 the 503 million decrease was attributable to decreased financing requirements as a result of improvements in net cash provided by operating activities and fewer store openings in 2005 as compared to 2004 net cash provided by financing activities was 559 million for 2004 compared to 640 million for 2003 the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 was attributable to decreased financing requirements as a result of our improvement in net cash provided by operating activities which was partially offset by more store openings in 2004 

liquidity and capital expenditures we will use the proceeds from the initial public offering to provide additional longterm capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening stores and to continue to maintain our existing stores and for general corporate purposes we do not expect mcdonalds to provide us with financing in the future however in accordance with the tax allocation agreement between mcdonalds and chipotle mcdonalds has agreed to compensate us for 

any nols or tax credits it uses that are attributable to our operations after mcdonalds files its consolidated federal tax return for 2006 the year we departed from the consolidated federal tax return we expect to receive final payment for the federal and some state nols that we have not utilized on a standalone basis at december 31 2005 the amount owed by mcdonalds totaled 282 million 

our total capital expenditures for 2005 were 830 million and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 95 million in 2006 relating primarily to our construction of new stores in both periods we believe that cash from operations together with the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the reimbursement from mcdonalds for use of our nols will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 were as follows 

 were obligated under noncancelable leases for our stores and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline stores or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding stores our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some store leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases see item 1a risk factors—substantially all of our stores are located in leased space that is subject to longterm noncancelable leases and were also subject to all of the risks associated with owning real estate with respect to the real property that we own 

we have entered into a services agreement with mcdonalds pursuant to which they will continue to provide us for a mutually agreedupon cost of about 10 to 11 million for the first year with certain services it has historically provided including among others accounting services insurance policy coverage and certain welfare plans for our employees the services agreement became operative on the closing date of the initial public offering january 31 2006 and has terms ranging from approximately one or two years depending on the service services will renew automatically unless we or mcdonalds terminate the services agreement prior to renewal in addition we may in the future repurchase chipotle franchises from our franchisees in connection with their obligation to dispose of either that franchise or their mcdonalds franchise within 24 months after relevant triggering events we are not obligated to repurchase any of these franchises 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies including our critical accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both 

significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leasehold improvements property and equipment 

we state the value of our leasehold improvements property and equipment including primarily store equipment furniture fixtures and small wares at cost minus accumulated depreciation and amortization we calculate depreciation using the straightline method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the related assets we amortize our leasehold improvements using the straightline method of accounting over the shorter of the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods or the estimated useful lives of the related assets we generally use estimated useful lives of between three and seven years for equipment between three and ten years for furniture and fixtures and between three and 20 years for leasehold improvements and buildings we expense repairs and maintenance as incurred but capitalize major improvements and betterments we make judgments and estimates related to the expected useful lives of these assets that are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance if we change those assumptions in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review property and equipment including leasehold improvements for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired we test impairment using historical cash flow and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows we perform this analysis at the store level to determine whether there are any indicators of permanent impairment in determining future cash flows we make significant estimates with respect to future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if we determine that assets are impaired we then measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the assetcarrying amount exceeds its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows we use estimates and assumptions that are subject to a high degree of judgment in determining asset fair values if we change those assumptions in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

goodwill 

goodwill resulted primarily from mcdonalds purchases of interest in chipotle goodwill is not subject to amortization we do however test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we completed our most recent impairment test as of november 30 2005 and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill or other indefinite lived assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill we compared the carrying amount of the company to its fair value based upon the low end of the proposed initial public offering price range at that time 1550 after the effective date of the companys initial public offering in january 2006 the fair value of the company will be determined based upon quoted market prices if we change these estimates in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill 

leases 

we lease most of our store locations we account for our leases under fasb statement no 13 accounting for leases sfas 13 and subsequent amendments which require that our leases be 

evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes we recognize rent expense for our operating leases which have escalating rentals over the term of the lease which includes reasonably assured renewal options on a straightline basis over the lease term in addition the lease term is deemed to commence when we take physical possession of the leased property we currently capitalize the straightline rent amounts during the period prior to store opening we will however begin expensing these amounts beginning january 1 2006 as a result of the issuance of fsp 131 we use a consistent lease term when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements when determining straightline rent expense and when determining classification of our leases as either operating or capital contingent rents are generally amounts we must pay to landlords when we have sales in excess of certain thresholds stipulated in certain store leases and are included in rent expense as they accrue some of our leases contain tenant improvement allowances for purposes of recognizing tenant improvement allowances we amortize the incentives over their estimated useful lives for tenant improvement allowances we also record a deferred rent liability or an obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 

insurance liability 

we maintain or in some cases mcdonalds maintains on our behalf various insurance policies for workers compensation employee health general liability and property damage pursuant to those policies were responsible for losses up to certain limits for our general liability and property damage insurance and are required to estimate a liability that represents our ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits this liability is based on our estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions if actual trends differ from our estimates our financial results could be affected 

income taxes 

prior to our initial public offering in january 2006 we were not a separate taxable entity for federal or most state income tax purposes consequently mcdonalds included our results of operations in its consolidated federal and state income tax returns for the periods prior to our initial public offering we will remain in mcdonalds consolidated tax returns for some states until their ownership percentage decreases to below 50 our tax provision is computed based on a separate return basis weve accounted for and currently account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas 109 sfas 109 established financial accounting reporting standards for the effects of income taxes resulting from an enterprises activities during the current and preceding years it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or mcdonalds tax returns if the future consequences of differences between financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities result in a net deferred tax asset we evaluate the probability of our ability to realize the future benefits indicated by that asset if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized well record a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset our ability to realize that net deferred tax asset generally depends on whether we have enough taxable income of an appropriate character within the carryforward period permitted by the tax law unless we have enough taxable income to offset the deductible amounts and carry forwards the related tax benefits will expire unused we evaluate both positive and negative evidence in making a determination as to whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized and we measure deferred items based on enacted tax laws this evaluation requires us to project our taxable income to determine if our income is sufficient to realize the tax assets the 

preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in tax laws 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2005 and 2004 once resolved however these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows in addition were involved in claims relating to the possible theft of our customers credit and debit card data in 2004 we recorded charges of 40 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards and monitoring expenses and fees as of december 31 2005 the remaining reserve was 18 million as the situation develops and more information becomes available the amount of the reserve may increase or decrease accordingly see item 1a risk factors— we may have experienced a security breach with respect to certain customer credit and debit card data and weve incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2005 the fasb issued fsp 131 fsp 131 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense fsp 131 is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 retroactive application is permitted but not required had fsp 131 been effective the company would have recognized additional preopening costs of approximately 42 million 36 million and 25 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

in addition to risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks of changing interest rates and commodity price risks associated with the food products and other operating essentials we purchase that are affected by commodity pricing and therefore subject to price volatility caused by weather production problems delivery difficulties and other factors that are beyond our control this discussion includes an assessment of the potential impact of inflation on our business 

changing interest rates 

were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash prior to our initial public offering we operated under an agreement with mcdonalds whereby they agreed to pay us interest on any excess cash at the 30day commercial paper rate plus 50 basis points changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had deposited 22 million and 07 million respectively with mcdonalds under this agreement bearing interest at 463 and 266 on each respective date following our initial public offering we will no longer be maintaining our excess cash with mcdonalds with the proceeds received from our initial public offering we intend to invest in shortterm marketable securities we will be subject to market risk on those shortterm investments 

commodity price risks 

were also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities that are affected by weather seasonality and other factors outside our control in 2003 our food expense was affected by higher avocado prices reflecting a poor growing season due to inclement weather and pestilence in 2004 prices for chicken rose significantly due to a ban by asian countries on their chicken exports following outbreaks of avian flu the more limited worldwide chicken supply combined with continued high demand drove prices upward beef prices have also been higher in the past year due to us restrictions on canadian imports in the wake of incidents of mad cow disease in canadian cattle herds weather is also a factor especially when severe conditions limit the growing season or crop quality this happened in 2004 when hurricanes in some parts of the united states damaged tomato crops and drove prices higher 

we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at sometime in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices though we do not have longterm supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient we also sometimes buy supplies at current market or spot prices weve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues weather crises and other world events that may affect supply prices longterm increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our future results if we could not increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons similarly if we believe the ingredient price increase to be short in duration we may choose not to pass on the cost increases which could adversely affect our shortterm financial results 

inflation 

over the past five years inflation has not significantly affected our operating results the impact of inflation could however significantly affect our operations in the following ways 

• food beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue has fluctuated in the past generally in response to changes in availability of our main ingredients based on current market conditions we believe that the cost of our main ingredients should not experience significant volatility except for shortterm chicken prices which have increased as a result of the damage to chicken farms caused by hurricane katrina in addition diesel prices could also experience further increases as a result of the shutdown of several oil refineries by hurricanes katrina and rita which could cause our other ingredient costs to increase • we pay many of our crew members hourly rates related to the applicable federal or state minimum wage although all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage our workers compensation and health insurance costs have been and are subject to continued inflationary pressures • costs for construction taxes repairs maintenance and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures and impact our occupancy costs in some markets inflation rates may be higher than the national average

overview 

how we make money restaurant sales 

we operate fast casual fresh mexican food restaurants in 21 states throughout the united states and in the district of columbia as of december 31 2005 we operated 481 restaurants and had eight restaurants operated by franchisees we generate revenue primarily through restaurant sales which represent sales of food and drinks in stores operated by chipotle our total revenue was 6277 million in 2005 a 333 increase from 2004 and a 989 increase from 2003 driven primarily by the 260 new store openings from january 1 2003 to december 31 2005 and higher average store sales several factors affect our restaurant sales in any period including mainly the number of stores in operation and average store sales we define average store sales as the average trailing 12month sales for companyowned stores in operation for at least 13 months 

new stores in existing and new markets have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth in the last three years we opened 80 104 and 76 stores in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we intend to open 80 to 90 stores in 2006 primarily in existing markets although we do expect to enter several new markets in 2006 we categorize our stores as either endcaps at the end of a line of stores inlines in a line of stores freestanding or urban as we expand into central urban areas our average costs to open new stores will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites in 2005 we spent on average about 910000 in development and construction costs per store with endcaps costing about 730000 inlines costing about 765000 freestanding costing about 12 million and urban costing about 13 million in each case reduced for landlord reimbursements received and excluding rent expense incurred during the construction period preopening cash rent expenses averaged approximately 18000 per restaurant during 2005 excluding approximately 24000 per restaurant in preopening straightline rent during construction 

average store sales for stores open at least 12 full months were 1440 million in 2005 1361 million in 2004 and 1274 million in 2003 there are two main factors increasing our average store sales comp store sales increases which we define as yearoveryear sales comparisons for stores in operation for at least 12 full months disregarding the portion of a month in which a store first begins operating and increases in new store opening sales we believe both of these have been impacted by the growing appeal of our core menu items increasing consumer awareness and appreciation of our food quality and our focus on building customer loyalty 

our comp store sales increases were 102 in 2005 133 in 2004 and 244 in 2003 comp store sales reflect positive periodtoperiod growth due mainly to an increase in the number of customer transactions in the third quarter of 2005 we began an initiative we call through put which focuses our efforts on improving the customer service time by getting the right crew at the right stations at the right time doing the right things in the right order we think the crew at our best performing through 

put restaurants are more attentive and more engaging with customers while also serving them more quickly increases in new store opening sales have occurred primarily because the time it takes a new stores sales to ramp up has shortened as our brand awareness has grown 

we expect our average stores sales to continue to increase in 2006 driven by comp store sales in the mid to high single digits we believe that comp store sales likely will not continue to increase at the rates achieved over the past several years however we also expect to grow income from operations in the longterm at an annual rate of around 25 

how we spend money food beverage and packaging costs labor other restaurant operating costs and other expenses 

we have four basic types of expense food beverage and packaging costs labor other restaurant operating costs consisting of occupancy costs and other operating costs and other expenses consisting of general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization preopening costs and gains or losses on asset disposals as we have grown considerably so have these costs our combined food beverage and packaging costs labor and other restaurant operating costs have increased to 5116 million in 2005 from 3941 million in 2004 and 2680 million in 2003 our other expenses have also increased to 851 million in 2005 from 705 million in 2004 and 554 million in 2003 

food beverage and packaging costs are the largest component of our expenses since we use higherquality ingredients that we purchase from carefully selected suppliers and are increasing our use of more expensive naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients our food expenses are often higher than those of other restaurants that use a higher proportion of commoditypriced ingredients beef chicken cheese avocados beans tomatoes and pork account for the most significant portion of our food beverage and packaging costs the price of these ingredients are the most volatile factor of our cost structure we expect to continue to try to absorb shortterm commodity fluctuations without increasing prices which could negatively impact margins 

our food beverage and packaging costs also include freight costs which can be higher than those of some of our competitors in part because we rely primarily on perishable ingredients rather than on processed food products these freight costs have also been affected by higher diesel prices that have in some cases resulted in the imposition of surcharges on the delivery of commodities to our distributors which they have generally passed on to us to the extent permitted under our arrangements with them 

labor costs which include wages for our store managers assistant store managers and crew bonuses taxes and benefits are the secondlargest component of our expenses we generally have two shifts at most of our stores which helps us better predict our store payroll expenses and in return provides our employees with more stable and predictable work hours some of the benefits we offer to our hourly employees are uncommon such as english and spanish lessons free food and the opportunity to participate in our 401k plan in addition to the benefits above we are also in the early stages of implementing our new restaurateur program which will be offered to our top performing managers and will provide for bonuses as a percentage of incremental sales above a threshold subject to a certain level of incremental profits being generated this program will also provide for incentive payouts for hiring and developing other successful general managers although this program may increase our labor costs in the shortterm we believe that it will help us in the longterm with the development and retention of great general managers for our stores 

other restaurant operating costs include occupancy costs and other operating costs occupancy costs include rent real estate taxes property taxes and common area maintenance charges other operating costs include utilities marketing and promotional costs including free samples bank fees credit and debit card processing fees store supplies repair maintenance and similar costs one of the 

unique employee benefits included in other operating costs is our company car program which is available to store managers who have been with us for more than four years although this and other similarly uncommon benefits may increase our other operating costs we believe it helps us to attract and keep good store managers which is important to our future success 

our other expenses include general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization preopening costs and gains or losses on disposals of assets general and administrative expenses include the corporate and administrative functions that support our stores including employee wages and benefits travel information systems recruiting and training costs corporate rent professional fees supplies and insurance and also include costs for store accounting services we received from mcdonalds depreciation and amortization are periodic noncash charges that represent the reduction in usefulness and value of a tangible asset principally relating to capital expenditures for store construction preopening expenses are expenses related to preparing to open a new store and include the costs of hiring and training the initial work force travel and the cost of food beverage and packaging used in connection with those activities losses on disposal of assets include the costs related to store closures store equipment retirements and costs to investigate potential store sites that we considered but subsequently rejected 

other factors affecting our results 

benefit for income taxes 

during 2005 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance recognizing a nonrecurring 203 million tax benefit tax expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was 128 million resulting in a net tax benefit of 75 million being recognized in the consolidated statement of operations we expect to continue to incur tax expense in 2006 

equity compensation expenses 

we recognized a total of 21 million in stockbased compensation during the year ended december 31 2005 under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r we adopted sfas 123r effective january 1 2005 before its required date of adoption using the modifiedprospective transition method under this transition method our 2005 equity compensation costs of 03 million related to our stock option plan includes the portion vesting in the year for i all sharebased payments granted prior to but not vested as of january 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas 123 and ii all sharebased payments granted after january 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r 

in 2005 we granted 153333 shares of our common stock with a grant date fair value of 1950 per share which vest in equal installments over three years and recognized 14 million of related compensation expense the fair value of the nonvested stock was estimated by management we did not obtain a contemporaneous valuation by an unrelated valuation specialist instead managements valuation framework relied principally on data compiled as a part of its review of strategic options in early 2005 prior to our determination to proceed with our initial public offering because that data reflected market conditions contemporaneous with the grant of the nonvested common stock as well as our thencurrent projections of our results and financial condition management concluded that retention of a separate valuation specialist for purposes of the grant was not necessary 

determining the fair value of our common stock required making complex and subjective judgments particularly since there was no public trading market for our common stock at the time of the valuation we used the market approach to estimate the value of the enterprise when the 

nonvested common stock was granted the market approach uses direct comparisons to other enterprises and their equity securities to estimate the fair value of privately issued securities we relied primarily on the price to earnings methodology and compared our historical and forecasted income growth rate to determine our peer group within the highgrowth restaurant industry and subsequently the appropriate earnings multiple range to apply to our forecasted income in determining our value we then reduced this by a marketability discount due to the lack of liquidity for our common stock 

in connection with our initial public offering we converted our outstanding stock appreciation rights sars granted in 2004 which were accounted for as a liability into stock options the options have terms consistent with the original sars including the same vesting schedule vest in full in july 2007 and an exercise price of 2235 per share in january 2006 we compared the fair value of the sars immediately before that conversion to the fair value of the options and recognized compensation costs of approximately 02 million once converted the options are accounted for as an equity award 

in connection with our initial public offering we completed a onetime broad based grant of 774150 options to purchase common stock as a result we expect total stockbased compensation expense of approximately 35 million to 40 million in 2006 

certain trends and uncertainties 

relationship with mcdonalds 

since we became a subsidiary of mcdonalds and began substantially expanding our operations in 1998 mcdonalds has provided a significant portion of the capital needed to operate our business and open new stores generally mcdonalds has done this through direct equity investments although it has also in some cases provided us with shortterm borrowings that we repaid through private placements of our equity securities we expect that mcdonalds will no longer finance us after our initial public offering and well fund our growth with cash flow from operations proceeds from the initial public offering and other sources 

we also currently benefit from our mcdonalds relationship in other ways such as pricing benefits for some products and services we will incur increased costs as a result of our initial public offering and the decrease in mcdonalds ownership interest in us and if mcdonalds ownership interest declines significantly from their current ownership position well lose an increasing amount of these benefits see item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business and industry—as we increase our independence from mcdonalds we may face difficulties replacing services it currently provides to us and entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or service providers for example 

• mcdonalds relationship with cocacola has helped us contain our beverage costs and we may lose some of that pricing advantage if we are no longer a consolidated subsidiary of mcdonalds or we may have to negotiate with other beverage suppliers to remain competitive • as a separate public company well incur legal accounting and other expenses which we expect to be a few million dollars in each of 2006 and future years that we did not incur as a majorityowned private subsidiary of mcdonalds • we opened 104 stores in 2004 when we were able to use mcdonalds real estate personnel and other resources to locate and obtain additional store sites in certain markets we did not use those resources in 2005 and do not anticipate using them in 2006 or in future years and • we expect that some of our labor costs such as workers compensation will increase as mcdonalds ownership interest decreases 28 

sourcing 

our focus on food with integrity has constrained our sourcing flexibility to some extent weve attempted to be careful in expanding that initiative so that we dont outpace available supply some of our ingredients come from small farms that have facilities that must comply with federal or industry standards for classification as natural and they may face economic or other limits on their growth we believe that consumers increasing concern about where and how food is raised environmental management and animal husbandry will foster demand for these foods which will in turn attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers that said we understand that well continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing food with integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices if our focus resonates with consumers it should improve our sourcing flexibility although wed expect that these kinds of ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than commoditypriced equivalents for some time to come 

how we did results of operations 

as our business grows as we open more stores and hire more people our food beverage packaging costs labor and other restaurant operating costs increase our operating results for 2005 2004 and 2003 are expressed as a percentage of total revenue below 



year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

the table below presents our operating results for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 and the related periodtoperiod changes 

  not meaningful restaurant sales of the 1565 million increase in restaurant sales 618 million resulted from 103 companyoperated stores opened in 2004 474 million was due to an increase in comp store sales increases and 473 million was due to 80 companyoperated stores opened in 2005 average store sales for the trailing 12month period ended december 31 2005 increased 58 to 1440 million from 1361 million for the trailing 12month period ended december 31 2004 driven primarily by comp store sales growth of 102 that reflected increasing nationwide awareness of our brand which also enabled new stores to open with higher average sales a substantial majority of the comp store sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in certain markets 

food beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of total revenue food beverage and packaging costs decreased due primarily to a decline in raw ingredient costs and menu price increases partially offset by increased fuel costs 

labor costs labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased largely due to improved employee efficiency resulting from an increase in the number of transactions which did not require a corresponding increase in staff and a gradual improvement over time in staffing our stores with the most appropriate number of crew members for each store 

occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenue occupancy costs decreased due to higher average store sales on a partially fixed cost base the decrease was partially offset by inflationary pressures on rents and the opening of stores in more expensive locations such as new york city 

other operating costs other operating costs as a percentage of total revenue declined primarily due to the effect of higher average store sales on a partially fixedcost base and improvements in store operations over time 

general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and stock based compensation expense resulting from a stock grant and the adoption of sfas 123r the increase in expense was offset by the 40 million charge in 2004 to establish a reserve related to potential credit card liabilities as a 

percentage of total revenue these expenses decreased due primarily to the effect of higher average store sales on a partially fixedcost base 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to stores opened in 2005 and in late 2004 as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization remained relatively consistent at 45 in 2005 and 46 in 2004 

preopening costs preopening costs decreased principally because there were fewer store openings in 2005 than in 2004 

in october 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 131 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 131 fsp 131 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense fsp 131 applies to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 retroactive application is permitted but not required had fsp 131 been effective in 2005 we would have recognized additional preopening costs of approximately 42 million we expect preopening costs to increase as we begin to recognize this expense in 2006 

loss on disposal of assets the increase in loss on disposal of assets was largely due to additional writeoffs associated with investigating potential store sites that we considered but subsequently rejected as well as writeoffs of obsolete equipment as a result of software upgrades 

net interest expense the increase in interest expense net of interest income was due to higher average borrowings from mcdonalds in 2005 than in the comparable 2004 period as mcdonalds did not make any equity contributions in 2005 

benefit for income taxes during 2005 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of 203 million the benefit from the reduction of the valuation allowance was partially offset by our current tax expense of 128 million which resulted in the realization of a net tax benefit of 75 million the 203 million tax benefit was a onetime tax benefit and we expect to incur tax expense prospectively 

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

the table below presents our operating results for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 and the related yeartoyear changes 

  not meaningful 31 

restaurant sales of the 1546 million increase in restaurant sales 628 million resulted from sales by 103 companyoperated stores opened in 2004 501 million resulted from additional sales in 2004 by 74 companyoperated stores opened in 2003 and 417 million was due to comp store sales increases a substantial majority of the comp store sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in certain markets average store sales for 2004 increased 68 to 1361 million from 1274 million for 2003 driven primarily by comp store sales growth of 133 that reflected increasing nationwide awareness of our brand which also enabled new stores to open with higher average store sales 

food beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of total revenue food beverage and packaging costs decreased largely driven by a menu price increase that was partially offset by higher chicken beef cheese and tomato costs 

labor costs labor costs as a percentage of total revenue decreased largely due to improved employee efficiency resulting from an increase in average store sales which did not require a corresponding increase in staff 

occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenue occupancy costs decreased primarily as a result of the effect of higher average store sales on a largely fixedcost base 

other operating costs other operating costs as a percentage of restaurant sales declined primarily due to the effect of higher average store sales on a partially fixedcost base 

general and administrative expenses the 106 million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from a 40 million charge to establish a reserve related to potential credit card liabilities and hiring more employees as we grew as a percentage of total revenue these expenses decreased as a result of our ability to further leverage our existing corporate infrastructure over more stores 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to new stores openings as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization decreased primarily due to the effect of higher average store sales on a largely fixedcost base 

preopening costs the increase in preopening costs was principally due to the opening of 103 companyoperated stores in 2004 an increase of 29 companyoperated store openings from 2003 

loss on disposal of assets the decrease in loss on disposal of assets was largely due to a 20 million writeoff associated with the closing of three stores in 2003 

net interest income the decrease in interest income net of interest expense was due to reduced earnings on average excess cash deposits in 2004 as compared to 2003

  seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter historically our average store sales are lower in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather the winter months than during periods of mild or warm weather the spring summer and fall months other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results for example stores located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year the number of trading days can also affect our results for example 2004 was a leap year which contributed about 3 percentage points of the increase in our restaurant sales in february of that year overall on a yeartoyear basis changes in trading days do not have a significant impact on our results 

our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new stores opened in a quarter and unanticipated events new stores have lower margins immediately following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new stores and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening because we tend to open more new stores later in the fiscal year our fourth quarter net income may be lower than in other quarters in addition unanticipated events also impact our results for example in the second quarter of 2005 we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of 203 million resulting in a net tax benefit of 167 million in that quarter in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded charges of 40 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges and for the cost of replacing cards and monitoring expenses and fees which reduced our operating income our loss on disposal of assets in the first quarter of 2004 decreased compared to the same period in 2003 largely due to a 20 million writeoff associated with the closing of three stores in the first quarter of 2003 accordingly results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new store construction working capital and general corporate needs until our initial public offering we have financed these requirements primarily through equity sales to mcdonalds and others as well as through cash flows from operations as of december 31 2005 we had no cash and cash equivalents on january 25 2006 our initial public offering became effective we will use the net proceeds from the offering of approximately 1213 million to provide additional longterm capital support to the growth of our business primarily through opening stores to continue to maintain our existing stores and for general corporate purposes 

mcdonalds and to a lesser extent some of our minority shareholders have historically provided us with significant financing we have also historically obtained shortterm borrowings from mcdonalds from time to time under documented lines of credit at an interest rate equal to the us prime rate plus 100 basis points the existing line of credit with mcdonalds under which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2005 will expire in june 2006 and is not expected to be renewed loans under these agreements were repaid with proceeds of private placements of our equity securities in april 2004 and june 2003 we issued shares of common stock to mcdonalds and to certain other persons who were accredited investors consisting of friends and family of our employees and persons having business relationships with us in each case as identified in our shareholders agreement for an aggregate purchase price of 650 million and 380 million respectively 

we havent required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables nor do they require significant inventories due in part to our use of various fresh ingredients in addition we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items generally within ten days thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 774 million for 2005 compared to 397 million for 2004 the 378 million increase was primarily attributable to a 316 million improvement in net income driven by higher average store sales and higher store margins due to having significantly more stores in operation net cash provided by operating activities was 397 million for 2004 compared to 221 million for 2003 the 176 million increase in 2004 was primarily attributable to a 138 million improvement in net income loss driven primarily by higher average store sales and higher store margins 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 830 million for 2005 compared to 956 million in 2004 the 126 million decrease related to lower capital expenditures in 2005 as we opened 80 stores in 2005 compared with 104 stores in 2004 net cash used in investing activities was 956 million for 2004 compared to 861 million for 2003 the increase was primarily as a result of higher capital expenditures as we opened 104 stores in 2004 compared to 76 in 2003 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was 57 million in 2005 compared to 559 million in 2004 the 503 million decrease was attributable to decreased financing requirements as a result of improvements in net cash provided by operating activities and fewer store openings in 2005 as compared to 2004 net cash provided by financing activities was 559 million for 2004 compared to 640 million for 2003 the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 was attributable to decreased financing requirements as a result of our improvement in net cash provided by operating activities which was partially offset by more store openings in 2004 

liquidity and capital expenditures we will use the proceeds from the initial public offering to provide additional longterm capital to support the growth of our business primarily through opening stores and to continue to maintain our existing stores and for general corporate purposes we do not expect mcdonalds to provide us with financing in the future however in accordance with the tax allocation agreement between mcdonalds and chipotle mcdonalds has agreed to compensate us for 

any nols or tax credits it uses that are attributable to our operations after mcdonalds files its consolidated federal tax return for 2006 the year we departed from the consolidated federal tax return we expect to receive final payment for the federal and some state nols that we have not utilized on a standalone basis at december 31 2005 the amount owed by mcdonalds totaled 282 million 

our total capital expenditures for 2005 were 830 million and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about 95 million in 2006 relating primarily to our construction of new stores in both periods we believe that cash from operations together with the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the reimbursement from mcdonalds for use of our nols will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 were as follows 

 were obligated under noncancelable leases for our stores and administrative offices our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more fiveyear extensions for endcap and inline stores or 15 to 20 years with several fiveyear extensions for freestanding stores our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance common charges and other operating costs some store leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases see item 1a risk factors—substantially all of our stores are located in leased space that is subject to longterm noncancelable leases and were also subject to all of the risks associated with owning real estate with respect to the real property that we own 

we have entered into a services agreement with mcdonalds pursuant to which they will continue to provide us for a mutually agreedupon cost of about 10 to 11 million for the first year with certain services it has historically provided including among others accounting services insurance policy coverage and certain welfare plans for our employees the services agreement became operative on the closing date of the initial public offering january 31 2006 and has terms ranging from approximately one or two years depending on the service services will renew automatically unless we or mcdonalds terminate the services agreement prior to renewal in addition we may in the future repurchase chipotle franchises from our franchisees in connection with their obligation to dispose of either that franchise or their mcdonalds franchise within 24 months after relevant triggering events we are not obligated to repurchase any of these franchises 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements or obligations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies including our critical accounting policies in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both 

significant and that require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

leasehold improvements property and equipment 

we state the value of our leasehold improvements property and equipment including primarily store equipment furniture fixtures and small wares at cost minus accumulated depreciation and amortization we calculate depreciation using the straightline method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the related assets we amortize our leasehold improvements using the straightline method of accounting over the shorter of the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods or the estimated useful lives of the related assets we generally use estimated useful lives of between three and seven years for equipment between three and ten years for furniture and fixtures and between three and 20 years for leasehold improvements and buildings we expense repairs and maintenance as incurred but capitalize major improvements and betterments we make judgments and estimates related to the expected useful lives of these assets that are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance if we change those assumptions in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review property and equipment including leasehold improvements for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired we test impairment using historical cash flow and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows we perform this analysis at the store level to determine whether there are any indicators of permanent impairment in determining future cash flows we make significant estimates with respect to future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term if we determine that assets are impaired we then measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the assetcarrying amount exceeds its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows we use estimates and assumptions that are subject to a high degree of judgment in determining asset fair values if we change those assumptions in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

goodwill 

goodwill resulted primarily from mcdonalds purchases of interest in chipotle goodwill is not subject to amortization we do however test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we completed our most recent impairment test as of november 30 2005 and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill or other indefinite lived assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill we compared the carrying amount of the company to its fair value based upon the low end of the proposed initial public offering price range at that time 1550 after the effective date of the companys initial public offering in january 2006 the fair value of the company will be determined based upon quoted market prices if we change these estimates in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill 

leases 

we lease most of our store locations we account for our leases under fasb statement no 13 accounting for leases sfas 13 and subsequent amendments which require that our leases be 

evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes we recognize rent expense for our operating leases which have escalating rentals over the term of the lease which includes reasonably assured renewal options on a straightline basis over the lease term in addition the lease term is deemed to commence when we take physical possession of the leased property we currently capitalize the straightline rent amounts during the period prior to store opening we will however begin expensing these amounts beginning january 1 2006 as a result of the issuance of fsp 131 we use a consistent lease term when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements when determining straightline rent expense and when determining classification of our leases as either operating or capital contingent rents are generally amounts we must pay to landlords when we have sales in excess of certain thresholds stipulated in certain store leases and are included in rent expense as they accrue some of our leases contain tenant improvement allowances for purposes of recognizing tenant improvement allowances we amortize the incentives over their estimated useful lives for tenant improvement allowances we also record a deferred rent liability or an obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 

insurance liability 

we maintain or in some cases mcdonalds maintains on our behalf various insurance policies for workers compensation employee health general liability and property damage pursuant to those policies were responsible for losses up to certain limits for our general liability and property damage insurance and are required to estimate a liability that represents our ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits this liability is based on our estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends actuarial assumptions and economic conditions if actual trends differ from our estimates our financial results could be affected 

income taxes 

prior to our initial public offering in january 2006 we were not a separate taxable entity for federal or most state income tax purposes consequently mcdonalds included our results of operations in its consolidated federal and state income tax returns for the periods prior to our initial public offering we will remain in mcdonalds consolidated tax returns for some states until their ownership percentage decreases to below 50 our tax provision is computed based on a separate return basis weve accounted for and currently account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas 109 sfas 109 established financial accounting reporting standards for the effects of income taxes resulting from an enterprises activities during the current and preceding years it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or mcdonalds tax returns if the future consequences of differences between financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities result in a net deferred tax asset we evaluate the probability of our ability to realize the future benefits indicated by that asset if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized well record a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset our ability to realize that net deferred tax asset generally depends on whether we have enough taxable income of an appropriate character within the carryforward period permitted by the tax law unless we have enough taxable income to offset the deductible amounts and carry forwards the related tax benefits will expire unused we evaluate both positive and negative evidence in making a determination as to whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized and we measure deferred items based on enacted tax laws this evaluation requires us to project our taxable income to determine if our income is sufficient to realize the tax assets the 

preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in tax laws 

reservescontingencies for litigation and other matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business these actions are subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty consequently we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2005 and 2004 once resolved however these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows in addition were involved in claims relating to the possible theft of our customers credit and debit card data in 2004 we recorded charges of 40 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards and monitoring expenses and fees as of december 31 2005 the remaining reserve was 18 million as the situation develops and more information becomes available the amount of the reserve may increase or decrease accordingly see item 1a risk factors— we may have experienced a security breach with respect to certain customer credit and debit card data and weve incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2005 the fasb issued fsp 131 fsp 131 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense fsp 131 is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 retroactive application is permitted but not required had fsp 131 been effective the company would have recognized additional preopening costs of approximately 42 million 36 million and 25 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

in addition to risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks of changing interest rates and commodity price risks associated with the food products and other operating essentials we purchase that are affected by commodity pricing and therefore subject to price volatility caused by weather production problems delivery difficulties and other factors that are beyond our control this discussion includes an assessment of the potential impact of inflation on our business 

changing interest rates 

were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash prior to our initial public offering we operated under an agreement with mcdonalds whereby they agreed to pay us interest on any excess cash at the 30day commercial paper rate plus 50 basis points changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had deposited 22 million and 07 million respectively with mcdonalds under this agreement bearing interest at 463 and 266 on each respective date following our initial public offering we will no longer be maintaining our excess cash with mcdonalds with the proceeds received from our initial public offering we intend to invest in shortterm marketable securities we will be subject to market risk on those shortterm investments 

commodity price risks 

were also exposed to commodity price risks many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food as well as our packaging materials are commodities that are affected by weather seasonality and other factors outside our control in 2003 our food expense was affected by higher avocado prices reflecting a poor growing season due to inclement weather and pestilence in 2004 prices for chicken rose significantly due to a ban by asian countries on their chicken exports following outbreaks of avian flu the more limited worldwide chicken supply combined with continued high demand drove prices upward beef prices have also been higher in the past year due to us restrictions on canadian imports in the wake of incidents of mad cow disease in canadian cattle herds weather is also a factor especially when severe conditions limit the growing season or crop quality this happened in 2004 when hurricanes in some parts of the united states damaged tomato crops and drove prices higher 

we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at sometime in the future fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on specified formula related to the prices of the goods such as spot prices though we do not have longterm supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient we also sometimes buy supplies at current market or spot prices weve tried to increase where necessary the number of suppliers for our ingredients which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and we follow industry news trade issues weather crises and other world events that may affect supply prices longterm increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our future results if we could not increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons similarly if we believe the ingredient price increase to be short in duration we may choose not to pass on the cost increases which could adversely affect our shortterm financial results 

inflation 

over the past five years inflation has not significantly affected our operating results the impact of inflation could however significantly affect our operations in the following ways 

• food beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue has fluctuated in the past generally in response to changes in availability of our main ingredients based on current market conditions we believe that the cost of our main ingredients should not experience significant volatility except for shortterm chicken prices which have increased as a result of the damage to chicken farms caused by hurricane katrina in addition diesel prices could also experience further increases as a result of the shutdown of several oil refineries by hurricanes katrina and rita which could cause our other ingredient costs to increase • we pay many of our crew members hourly rates related to the applicable federal or state minimum wage although all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage our workers compensation and health insurance costs have been and are subject to continued inflationary pressures • costs for construction taxes repairs maintenance and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures and impact our occupancy costs in some markets inflation rates may be higher than the national average
